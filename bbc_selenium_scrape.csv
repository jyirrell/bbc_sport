0,Wolves 0-1 Man Utd: Marcus Rashford comes off bench to score winner,SAT 31 Dec 2022,premier-league,"Marcus Rashford turned from villain to hero as he came off the bench to score the only goal against Wolves and move Manchester United into the Premier League top four.Manager Erik ten Hag left Rashford out of his starting line-up for ""internal disciplinary"" reasons.But after a disappointing opening period, in which Rashford's replacement Alejandro Garnacho wasted the visitors' best chance when his shot was saved by Jose Sa, the England man scored 14 minutes from time.Rashford picked the ball up outside the Wolves area, then, after exchanging passes with Bruno Fernandes, held off three defenders before driving home his 11th goal of the season in all competitions.It was the first time he had scored in three successive games for United since December 2019.The result ended Julen Lopetegui's two-match winning start as Wolves manager and kept them in the relegation zone.However, they came so close to snatching a point in stoppage time when Raul Jimenez's goal-bound header was turned away at point-blank range by David de Gea.The availability of loan signing Matheus Cunha for Wednesday's West Midlands derby at Aston Villa cannot come soon enough for a side who struggle so badly to turn impressive approach play into goals.Lopetegui said: ""The way they fought a big team like Man Utd, in the end I thought we deserved more.""What did you think of Wolves' display?

In their absence, Rashford remains United's most potent goal threat.The determination he showed to drive through so many defenders and score his latest effort indicates a hunger that was absent for much of last season.Rashford thought he had a second near the end but his close-range effort - after Sa saved his initial shot - was ruled out for handball.The win moved United into the top four - the first time they have been in the Champions League qualification places this season.Ten Hag said: ""We made a good step today - first time we are in top four but it means nothing.""We have to win every game. We want to try and win something. It depends on hard work from everyone.""Rashford had 'right answer' after being dropped - Ten HagLopetegui must find answer to scoring woesIn his first home league game in charge of Wolves, Lopetegui was a demonstrative presence on the edge of his technical area.If not quite as manic as Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, the former Sevilla boss was open with his feelings.That included demanding a yellow card for Casemiro when he blocked Ruben Neves off during the first half, then letting the fourth official know it should have been two as referee Rob Jones finally showed a yellow card to the Brazilian when he fouled Daniel Podence.Once he calms down from such injustices, Lopetegui will know - as he always has - the answer to Wolves' problems comes through finding the net.Lopetegui said: ""We have to improve. I believe in my players. But it is not about one or two players. It is a team task. If we have more chances, we may score more.""Diego Costa worked hard for little reward before the break and, until Jimenez was introduced once the Spaniard was replaced, there was no focal point for the Wolves midfield to play to.Neves almost pulled one of his wonder strikes out of his repertoire to put the hosts in front, but De Gea was equal to that, just as he was when Jimenez's stoppage-time effort was heading into the net.Wolves deserved more - Lopetegui",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64083698

A minute's applause ended with the home fans chanting the former full-back's name.Fulham's players wore tracksuits in honour of George Cohen before kick-offOnce under way, Southampton had the clearest early chance when Che Adams darted behind the hosts' high line, but goalkeeper Bernd Leno did well to repel his effort.Mohamed Elyounoussi skimmed a shot narrowly over the crossbar, but Fulham gradually asserted themselves in midfield, with Palhinha to the fore, and were rewarded on 32 minutes.Willian clipped a corner to the edge of the penalty area, which Andreas Pereira met with his instep. The volley was well-struck but seemed to be heading off target until Ward-Prowse's instinctive attempt to block instead ensured it ended up in the back of the net.Pereira stabbed a shot wide after the break as Fulham started the second half brightly.Fulham not at best but deserved win - SilvaBut Ward-Prowse, who is second only to David Beckham in Premier League free-kick goals, gives Saints a threat that few other sides can offer at set-pieces.The 28-year-old captain whipped a superb swirling free-kick around the wall and beyond Leno's dive to cancel out his own-goal and level the contest.It seemed the scores would remain equal before the contest sprung back into life in the final few minutes.Tom Cairney and Willian almost combined to set up Pereira at one end before Southampton substitute Romain Perraud threatened at the other.The hosts went ahead again when another well-worked set-piece isolated Palhinha, who stands 6ft 3in tall, against a clutch of smaller defenders.Mitrovic, who has 10 goals in his previous 13 Premier League games, had a chance to add to his prolific season after a foul on Dan James. But his penalty, well saved by Gavin Bazunu, ended an uncharacteristically quiet afternoon for the Serbian striker.Saints 'have to be better'Saints have to be better - JonesSouthampton's next game is against Nottingham Forest, one place above them in the table, at home on Wednesday.Manager Nathan Jones, who took over from sacked Ralph Hasenhuttl in November, said his players need to be sharper tactically and mentally to avoid their efforts being undermined by more bad defending.""We didn't do the basics well on two occasions and that is what let us down,"" he said.

They made a fantastic goal and when that happens you say 'congratulations', but in general we did really well.""Gray stunner eases pressure on Lampard Lampard praises 'special' Everton characterEverton had shipped seven goals in their past three league matches and won only one of their past eight.An air of inevitability around how Everton's season was shaping up had seemed to settle on supporters, pressure was mounting on manager Frank Lampard, and a lack of progress on the pitch looked to be continuing in Manchester.But while Guardiola's side looked somewhat deflated by the second-half stoppages, Everton seemed all too pleased for the game to become fragmented and to limit City's usually expansive football.Gray's magnificent goal almost came from nowhere, and every City attempt at a winner was blocked by a pink Everton shirt.Crucially, Seamus Coleman got in the way of Phil Foden's late opportunity and Rodri completely mistimed a header from a corner in the final seconds.A point, at the home of the defending champions, is a valuable one for Everton and leaves them 16th in the table, two points above the relegation zone.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64083701

Mitoma had a second goal chalked off to deny the home fans a grandstand finish as Arsenal held on for a deserved three points.Brighton were a long way off the pace for the first hour, but after Martinelli had restored the three-goal advantage they showed great spirit to reduce the arrears again through Ferguson.They were then convinced they had made it 4-3 with two minutes remaining when Mitoma looked to have scored again, but after a VAR check the Japanese midfielder was revealed to be just offside.Arsenal are back in action against Newcastle United on Tuesday, buoyed by an increasingly formidable-looking lead over champions City with both sides having played 16 games.Arteta plays down title hopes after extending lead at New YearWhat did you make of Brighton's performance?

Rattled by Mitomo's goal and then a good spell from the hosts, Martinelli finished off a length-of-the-pitch move with a shot that went in off Sanchez's legs to seemingly put the game beyond Brighton's reach.William Saliba was then too casual on the edge of his own area, allowing Ferguson his chance to pull another goal back, and when Mitoma seemed to have made the score 4-3, Mikel Arteta's side looked worried until the decision by VAR.Arsenal face a tough January before reaching the league campaign's midpoint, with Tottenham and Manchester United to follow after Newcastle. Their two meetings with second-placed Manchester City are also yet to come, and Arteta will want to address the defensive frailties that surfaced on the south coast.Brighton 2-4 Arsenal: Roberto De Zerbi rues 'four strange goals' in defeatYear-end high for Seagulls despite defeatThe Seagulls returned from the World Cup break in fine style, winning 3-1 at Southampton on Boxing Day, but they will regret their slow start here.Errors by Sanchez played a part in Arsenal's third and fourth goals, but Roberto de Zerbi's side finished strongly after capitalising on a dip in the Gunners' performance following the substitutions of White and Zinchenko.Ferguson, 18, was a handful on just his third Premier League appearance, all as substitutes, and he was smart enough to latch on to Saliba's error to give his side a sniff of a comeback.Mitoma was unlucky not get on the scoresheet twice, but the Seagulls nevertheless end 2022 in eighth - their highest-ever placing in the top flight at the end of a calendar year.Reaction to Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion contentVisit our Arsenal page",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64083699

Christian Norgaard hit his swivelling volley well, and after it was saved by Lukasz Fabianski, Toney reacted first to follow up and stab home. The second, shortly before half-time, was even worse from a West Ham perspective. Toney played a simple lobbed ball over the top of the sleeping home defence from a throw-in near the halfway line.Da Silva outmuscled and outpaced Aaron Cresswell to streak through and slot past Fabianski for his first goal since August.These teams will meet again in the FA Cup third round on 7 January. Whether Moyes remains in post for that fixture remains to be seen.Toney appeared in serious pain as he was stretchered offToney hits landmark - but leaves on a stretcherIn complete contrast to West Ham, Brentford have set a new club Premier League record of five consecutive games unbeaten. The Bees have not had a longer top-flight unbeaten run since they went six games without defeat between February and March 1939.Things could have been different had West Ham taken their chances - notably when Declan Rice struck the post early on and when Emerson Palmieri stung the gloves of David Raya with a near-post drive.However Brentford saw out the second half in relative comfort and this result, combined with the 2-2 draw against Tottenham on Boxing Day, will leave Thomas Frank satisfied with how his side have returned to action following the World Cup.One question which remains however is what Brentford will do should Toney be ruled out by a long-term injury.This is the stark reality they could face after the forward, tipped by many for a place in England's 2022 World Cup squad, jarred his knee in the turf after an innocuous challenge for a late corner.Toney was left banging the turf, his face screwed up in clear pain, before being carried from the field on a stretcher.""Of course, it didn't look great, but I've also been in this game long enough to know that you never know exactly what it is until it's been assessed over the following days,"" Frank said.""Hopefully it's a minor injury, a minor thing, there's a good chance for that, but of course it could be worse. We don't know yet.""West Ham 0-2 Brentford: I can't praise the players enough - Thomas FrankEven if the injury is not as bad as it first appears, Toney also faces being banned if FA charges of breaching betting rules are proven. He has until January 4 to respond regarding the 262 alleged breaches.On the field, Toney remains one of the Premier League's deadliest strikers.

Had he left it, then goalkeeper Ward - who clearly shouted for him to do so - had a straightforward gather at his near post, but instead Faes made the most awkward of connections to send the ball looping over the Wales international.The second goal, however, was just plain unfortunate as Faes' momentum as he rushed to get back and clear off the line meant he could do little when the ball from Nunez's shot bounced back off the post and into his path.Faes becomes just the fourth player to score two own goals in a single Premier League game, after Jamie Carragher (1999, Liverpool vs Manchester United), Michael Proctor (2003, Sunderland vs Charlton) and Jonathan Walters (2013, Stoke vs Chelsea).Liverpool 2-1 Leicester: I don't think we deserved to lose - Brendan Rodgers",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64072799
8,Leeds 1-3 Man City: Erling Haaland reaches 20 Premier League goals in record time,WED 28 Dec 2022,premier-league,"Erling Haaland has scored 20 league goals for Manchester City in 14 matchesErling Haaland became the fastest player to reach 20 Premier League goals as Manchester City overcame a stubborn Leeds to reduce Arsenal's lead at the top of the table to five points.Frustrated by a disciplined and determined home side and their own profligacy for much of the first half at Elland Road, City snatched the lead just before the break through Rodri's follow-up finish and then sped into the distance in a one-sided second half.Having seen a couple of efforts saved early in the game, Haaland - playing in the city of his birth against the side he supports - did not celebrate his goals but showed little mercy in securing them to bring up his impressive tally in just his 14th game of the campaign.He could not miss for his first, set up in front of an open goal by the unselfish Jack Grealish, who himself had missed a hat-trick of good opportunities in the first 45 minutes.Grealish was the provider again for Haaland's second, which he slotted in from close range following a deflection to give Leeds too much of an deficit to overcome.In keeping with their display, the home side refused to lie down and got a goal back through Pascal Struijk's header from a corner. And they could have set up a grandstand finish had Joe Gelhardt's poked finish not trickled the wrong side of the post.City, though, secured the win to move back up to second behind the Gunners and two points better off than third-placed Newcastle, both of whom won on Monday.The relegation battle is no less intense, with Leeds in 15th place on 15 points and one of 11 teams separated by just eight points.Follow live text commentary of Leeds v Man City in the Premier LeagueGo straight to all the best Leeds United contentVisit our Manchester City pageLeeds 1-3 Man City: Grealish can be a goal threat - GuardiolaRuthless Haaland picks up where he left offWhile 16 of his team-mates were competing for the World Cup in Qatar, Haaland was forced to watch on from afar, stewing on Norway's failure to qualify and readying himself to take it out on the next opponents he faced.The early signs were that Leeds might get a reprieve - not through any sentimentality towards his hometown club, whom he was reportedly almost joined as a teenager, but more a little competitive rustiness.Two chances that he has made a habit of gobbling up were spurned, or rather saved by impressive Whites keeper Illan Meslier.Haaland was not alone. Grealish was especially wasteful, drawing derision from a home crowd already hostile towards him with three misses, all of which a player of his class should convert.However, after Rodri had broken the deadlock at the end of an incisive break just before half-time, Haaland and Grealish stepped up in emphatic fashion.Leeds United 1-3 Manchester City: Jesse Marsch in awe of 'special & relentless' Erling HaalandThe latter won a ball high up and laid a goal on a plate for the latter before again providing the assists for another simple finish soon after. The two moments secured the points, despite Struijk's provision of a late moment of hope for the home side.It was further evidence of Haaland's threat. He can drift through much of a game, but he needs only a fraction of a yard on a defender or the slightest sight of goal to hurt opponents.In the end, Leeds were let off the hook somewhat, with the Norwegian missing a number of opportunities to register what would have been a fourth league hat-trick of what is shaping up to be a remarkable season.After the full-time whistle, he shared a hug and chat with Leeds boss Jesse Marsch and defender Rasmus Kristensen - former Red Bull Salzburg colleagues - while the home fans serenaded him chants of ""you're Leeds and you know you are"".If he was taking a moment to bask in the surroundings, it was only a brief one.

9,Chelsea 2-0 Bournemouth: Hosts claim comfortable win to boost top-four hopes,TUE 27 Dec 2022,premier-league,"Mason Mount marked his 150th Chelsea appearance with a goalChelsea boosted their top-four hopes as they resumed their Premier League season with a comfortable victory over Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge.Having failed to score in three consecutive matches prior to the break for the World Cup it took Chelsea less than 16 minutes to get up and running with Kai Havertz sliding in an effort at the back post from Raheem Sterling's low cross. With the hosts dominant, Mason Mount celebrated his 150th appearance for Chelsea in style, curling a superb effort into the bottom right corner of the Bournemouth net from the edge of the penalty area.It drew a nod of satisfaction from manager Graham Potter, who will have been delighted by the slick performance his side delivered, particularly during the first half. Christian Pulisic saw an effort ruled out after Havertz was judged to have fouled Adam Smith, while the German also spurned a second-half opportunity to extend Chelsea's lead.The result sees Chelsea move up to eighth in the table, six points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham with Bournemouth remaining in 14th.The only negative in Potter's and Chelsea's evening came with the earlier-than-planned withdrawal of Reece James, seven minutes into the second period, on his return from the knee injury that ruled him out of the England squad for Qatar. The 23-year-old lay on the turf with his hands on his head before receiving treatment and eventually walking off unaided.While the Cherries improved after the break, and substitute Ryan Christie forced home goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga into a good save, they rarely looked capable of applying any late pressure to the hosts.

There was a notable fluency to their play, particularly via the combinations that Sterling, James, Mount and Italian playmaker Jorginho provided, while Havertz and Pulisic worked tirelessly up front to offer an outlet. And until he was forced off, everything that right-back James produced oozed class.  His marauding runs down the right gave Chelsea an added dimension in attack, with only a good save from visiting goalkeeper Mark Travers denying him a goal just before the break.Sluggish start dents BournemouthBournemouth showed 'incredible belief' - O'NeilDominic Solanke's driving run and an early Philip Billing free-kick suggested Bournemouth felt capable of taking the game to Chelsea on their own patch.However, while Gary O'Neil will take positives from the way his team prevented the scoreline from going away from them further in the second period, he will be disappointed by their passive first 45 minutes. In that period they conceded their 33rd and 34th goals of the campaign, with 26 of those now coming away from home.Chelsea's opener came from a series of straight passes down the right, with Havertz unchallenged as he opened the scoring, while Mount was given time and space to take aim as four Bournemouth players backed off.

10,"Manchester United 3-0 Nottingham Forest: Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial & Fred score",TUE 27 Dec 2022,premier-league,"Marcus Rashford has scored five goals in his past five starts for Manchester United and EnglandMarcus Rashford scored one and created another as Manchester United overcame illness issues to beat Nottingham Forest and move to within a point of the top four.Rashford converted a superb opener after 19 minutes when he was picked out by Christian Eriksen in a pre-planned corner routine, allowing the striker to exploit Forest's failure to track his run by sweeping a first-time shot past Wayne Hennessey.The England forward turned provider three minutes later, cutting in from the left wing and rolling a pass to Antony Martial, whose low finish from the edge of the area found the net after Hennessey failed to hold.Forest's keeper denied Antony, Martial and Rashford before substitute Fred profited from an excellent through ball from fellow Brazilian Casemiro to find the bottom corner three minutes from time.Forest never recovered from that first-half double blow, although they did have a goal ruled out by VAR just before the break.Steve Cooper's men have not scored a league goal away from the City Ground since 20 August and remain second bottom.For United, it completed a fourth successive victory in all competitions and underlined the theory that the exit of Cristiano Ronaldo will not have a negative effect on the remainder of their season.Manchester United v Nottingham Forest - reactionGo straight to all the best Manchester United contentVisit our Nottingham Forest pageCan Rashford and Martial solve Man Utd's striker problems?Ten Hag wants more goals from Man UtdThere has been a lot of talk of strikers at United since Ronaldo's contract was terminated last month.PSV Eindhoven's Cody Gakpo was certainly on their radar before he agreed a move to Liverpool, even if the likely transfer fee would have priced him out of a move to Old Trafford, given the significant spending last summer that manager Erik ten Hag demanded.Unless the situation changes, the best Ten Hag can hope for is a loan signing.However, on nights like this, it is not obvious that he actually needs reinforcements.Injuries have limited Martial's involvement this season but the Frenchman now has five goals to his name and is effective in the number nine role, even if he prefers to attack from wider positions.And Ten Hag said before the game 25-year-old Rashford was capable of scoring 20 league goals.Had substitute Alejandro Garnacho picked out the England man with a cut-back deep into the second half, Rashford would have doubled his tally for the night, which, as it is, takes him into double figures for the season in all competitions.With Garnacho and Anthony Elanga making decent contributions off the bench, Ten Hag will need to look hard to find someone who is both good enough and within the club's budget.VAR denies Forest a rare away goalForest could have done better at Man Utd - CooperAt the start of the month, former World Cup final referee Howard Webb took over the management of elite officials in England.He has vowed to speed up the VAR process and try to iron out some of the issues still being experienced with it within the English game.Yet, speaking to BBC Sport last week, Webb said incidents that involved multiple issues would always cause a problem and Forest were on the wrong end of one just before the break that took three minutes for Andy Madley and his colleagues at Stockley Park to solve.Ryan Yates appeared to have headed in at the far post. However, there was a potential handball which needed to be checked. Once those replays had been studied, it became apparent Willy Boly had actually diverted the ball home.As it turned out, Yates didn't handle. But Boly was offside and what would have been Forest's first Premier League away goal since Brennan Johnson scored in a 1-1 draw at Everton was ruled out.

This is his first Premier League goal against Brentford, meaning he has scored against all 32 teams he has facedEngland captain Harry Kane scored in the first Premier League match since the World Cup as Tottenham fought back from 2-0 down to draw with Brentford.The Bees were on course for their first win over Spurs since 1948 after goals from Vitaly Janelt and Ivan Toney, before Spurs netted twice within six minutes.Kane, who scored one penalty and missed another in England's 2-1 quarter-final loss to France, pulled one back in the 65th minute with an excellent header from Clement Lenglet's cross.'Machine' Kane can be 'number one in world'Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg made it 2-2 with a curling finish - and neither side was able to find a winner, with Kane heading a chance against the crossbar.The hosts had taken a 15th-minute lead through Janelt's close-range effort after goalkeeper Fraser Forster, in his first league start for Spurs, could only block the ball into his path following Mathias Jensen's volley.Brentford doubled their advantage as Toney grabbed his 11th league goal of the season, reacting quickest to tap in after Christian Norgaard had headed on a corner, but it was not enough.Toney, 26, was appearing in his first game since being charged by the Football Association with 262 alleged betting breaches.

It was the way we did it, without competing,"" Vieira told BBC Match of the Day.""Fulham prepared their game really well and we weren't brave enough to play forward. I believe we had the best chance before they scored their goal, but we didn't do enough to deserve something from the game.""We have to give them credit, analyse ourselves and try to bounce back as soon as possible.""Dominant throughout, Marco Silva's side were helped by Palace's indiscipline, which put a stop to their hopes of a fourth straight home win.The result strengthens the visitors' unlikely European push, as they sit in eighth, just two points off the top six.Heading towards the half-hour mark, Palace, having struggled to impose themselves early on, almost took the lead. Clever play by Michael Olise freed Jordan Ayew inside the area, but his effort crashed off the bar.Fulham made them pay moments later when Decordova-Reid headed the visitors into a deserved lead as Mitrovic pounced on slack play from Joachim Andersen before finding his team-mate with a pinpoint cross.The hosts' misery was compounded further when Mitchell was dismissed after Tete reached a loose ball first and was caught by the Palace man.Any chance of a quick Palace resurgence were quashed 12 minutes after the break. Tomkins, on a booking, appeared to elbow Mitrovic off the ball, resulting in the game's second red card.Ream then reacted quickly to Mitrovic's knock-down from a corner to double Fulham's lead on 71 minutes. Referee Andy Madley checked the VAR monitor for a potential handball against the Serb, only to stick with his original decision, before Mitrovic made it three 10 minutes from time.Palace punished after losing coolThe two red cards were undoubtedly the moments on which this game turned. Mitchell's challenge on Tete came just three minutes after Decordova-Reid's opener, and Tomkins' moment of madness forced them into damage control.But even with 11 men, they didn't do nearly enough to win the game or even avoid defeat, marking a disappointing return to Premier League action after the World Cup.Vieira named an attacking line-up but that intent was never transformed into a coherent performance as they were roundly beaten.Festive cheer as Fulham march onFulham's past two Premier League campaigns have ended in relegation to the Championship, but fears of a third drop are disappearing at a rapid rate, as they look well at home at this level.It is now 22 points from 16 games under Silva this term, just six fewer than they got in the entirety of their last Premier League campaign two years ago.The manner in which they dominated the ball and made possession count was hugely impressive, and with Mitrovic grabbing his 10th goal of the season, they have a striker in the sort of form to make them dream of a European place, or even more than that.Mitrovic insists his side didn't rely on the red cards to get a comprehensive three points.""We played against a good side, of course they had two red cards,"" he said. ""Even before the first, we dominated and scored the goal. The second red card made it easy but we played really well all over the pitch.""We tried to put more pressure on them. We had to manage their intensity, then the second goal made it even more easy. I'll take one goal and two assists all day, but the most important thing was the three points.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64022712

A first away victory of the season proved a perfect late Christmas present for Julen Lopetegui, who becomes the first Wolves manager to win his first top-flight match in charge of the club since John Barnwell in 1978.The visitors made far from an ideal start, falling behind early on when Yerry Mina glanced Dwight McNeil's near-post corner into the net. However, they levelled midway through the first period from a well-worked corner routine with Daniel Podence calmly sliding the ball past home goalkeeper Jordan Pickford from Joao Moutinho's lobbed pass to the back post.It was no more than the visitors deserved in an entertaining encounter but one in which the attacking shortcomings of both sides came into focus.Idrissa Gueye's incisive pass to Anthony Gordon should have allowed the hosts to regain the lead but the Everton winger was superbly denied by Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa, while Neal Maupay twice failed to capitalise from promising positions.Wolves win 'only one step' to survival - Lopetegui Wolves to sign Cunha on initial loan on 1 JanuaryIt was far from from one-way traffic though, Wolves forward Diego Costa was unable to get enough power on a diving header to beat Pickford, who also repelled Hugo Bueno's placed effort after the break. And while Everton saw Ben Godfrey's late effort hacked to safety by Ruben Neves, Wolves went up the other end in the 95th minute to claim a valuable victory, with Ait-Nouri turning the ball past Pickford from Adama Traore's cross.The win took Wolves up to 18th, a place below Everton who have now lost their past four games.Gloomy GoodisonEverton 1-2 Wolves: Lampard says Toffees 'desperately unlucky' to loseIn recent times there has been a distinctly familiar and frustrating feeling among Everton supporters unhappy with a lack of progress on the pitch. And the sight of a manager under pressure is one that appears to be playing on a loop at Goodison Park, with this defeat met by a chorus of boos. Frank Lampard's team have now won just one of their past eight top-flight matches and despite temporarily lifting the gloom by establishing an early advantage they never looked fully in control. In fact, both prior to and after Mina's header, it was Wolves that looked the more capable and fluent side in possession.There was an certain element of inevitability about the way things unfolded, with Everton, who have the second worst record in front of goal at home in the Premier League, failing to make the most of their chances and then succumbing to a late Wolves counter-attackFollow all of Monday's Premier League actionVisit our Everton pageGo straight to all the best Wolves contentLopetegui lifts the moodEverton 1-2 Wolves: Julen Lopetegui praises visitors' mentality after victoryWhile Wolves remain in the relegation places, the manner of their performance and having the resilience to turn a deficit into a win for the first time this season suggests the arrival of Lopetegui has lifted the mood at Molineux. The Spanish boss spent most of the encounter as a prowling, cajoling presence in the technical area. Instead of allow himself a moment to celebrate Podence's equaliser, the former Real Madrid manager was already directing his players to refocus their efforts.Lopetegui's substitutions also proved key, with Traore's run and delivery eventually finding fellow replacement Ait-Nouri to deliver the coup de grace.

16,Aston Villa 1-3 Liverpool: Reds make winning start to Premier League top-four bid,MON 26 Dec 2022,premier-league,"Stefan Bajcetic became Liverpool's third youngest Premier League scorer behind Michael Owen and Raheem SterlingLiverpool made a winning return to Premier League action as they restarted their bid to force their way into the top four with an entertaining victory over Aston Villa.Goals from Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and teenager Stefan Bajcetic ensured the Reds recorded a third successive league win for the first time this season and reduced the gap to the Champions League places to five points.While Liverpool's first fixture after the World Cup break resulted in a Carabao Cup fourth round defeat by Manchester City on Thursday, Salah's fifth-minute opener - created by a couple of sublime passes from full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson - gave them the perfect start on their league return.Darwin Nunez's wastefulness prevented the visitors from extending their lead but they were able to add a second before half-time when Van Dijk's shot deflected in off Ezri Konsa following a corner.Ollie Watkins and Leon Bailey had both squandered a couple of fine opportunities for Villa in an exciting first half but Unai Emery's side were rewarded for their persistence after the restart when Watkins headed in Douglas Luiz's cross.However, Spanish 18-year-old Bajcetic's first senior goal two minutes after coming on as a substitute, which followed great work by Nunez to sprint for a ball over the top, ended home hopes of a dramatic fightback at Villa Park.Stefan Bajcetic - the 'cheeky' teenager and his 'Christmas story'Liverpool up and running in top-four bidAston Villa 1-3 Liverpool: Darwin Nunez was top class - KloppWhile Jurgen Klopp said he was pleased that his sixth-placed side would resume their campaign ""within punching distance"" of the Premier League's top four, he added prior to kick-off that he felt it was a ""long arm still"" following their early season struggles.But, with a game in hand on fourth-placed Tottenham, the Liverpool boss must now feel confident of attaining their target in the second half of the campaign.The Reds' cause had received an early boost when Spurs drew with Brentford earlier in the day and their first-half double put them in position to take full advantage.Robertson's crucial role in the opener - setting up Salah with a first-time ball across the six-yard box after Alexander-Arnold's stunning outside-of-the-foot pass - saw him overtake Leighton Baines as the defender with the most assists in the competition's history (54).Despite appearing comfortable at half-time it was certainly not job done for Liverpool against determined opposition and they were relieved to add a late third after withstanding spells of intense Villa pressure following Watkins' lifeline.Klopp's side dropped 20 points from their opening 14 fixtures - two shy of the total number of points they let slip in the whole of the last campaign - but there are now signs of momentum for last season's runners-up.Go straight to all the best Liverpool content Nunez shows worth despite missesNunez (left) failed to score but still made a significant contribution for LiverpoolThere may not have been a goal for Nunez to celebrate at Villa Park but the Uruguayan demonstrated flashes of the promise that convinced Liverpool to pay big money to sign him from Benfica in the summer.There is certainly no doubt that he should have added to his tally of nine goals in 20 games for the club here - and on another occasion such misses could prove costly.The tenacious 23-year-old ended the match with the highest expected goals value of any player (1.15 xG) after landing four of his six shots on target - five of which were taken inside the penalty area. But his 12 touches inside the opposition box - also a match-leading figure - hinted at his broader influence and his unpredictable movements caused huge issues for the Villa defence throughout.Perhaps the clearest demonstration of his importance arrived in the build-up to Liverpool's third. With the match inside the final 10 minutes, Nunez refused to give up the chase and cut the ball back from the byeline to allow substitute Bajcetic to all but seal the three points and avoid a potentially awkward finish.Positive signs for Emery's VillaLiverpool's early goal finished match - EmeryDespite defeat, there remains much for Aston Villa supporters to be optimistic about with the Emery era only just beginning.The four-time Europa League winner was bidding to become the first Villa manager to win each of his first three league games in the club's history and he will believe his side's positive approach deserved more.Watkins had already been denied by Alisson prior to Liverpool's first and later passed up an opportunity from John McGinn's back-post cross, while twice an off-balance Bailey failed to connect with the ball when well-placed.This was another positive showing and they remain five points clear of the relegation positions following encouraging pre-World Cup victories over Manchester United and Brighton.Go straight to all the best Aston Villa content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64022706

Gabriel Martinelli put the hosts ahead, catching out West Ham's former Gunners keeper Lukasz Fabianski by tucking inside the near post from a tight angle when he seemed more likely to cross.The points were sealed when Eddie Nketiah - starting in place of the injured Gabriel Jesus - spun sharply in the box before firing into the opposite bottom corner.

Arteta will not be getting carried after this win over West Ham, especially with several significant fixtures - not least against Manchester City on 15 February - on the horizon.But the Gunners sent a message with a clinical second-half performance and the omens are also in their favour.The team who topped the Premier League table on Christmas Day have gone on to be champions in 10 of the past 13 seasons.Nketiah takes chance as West Ham struggle in front of goalArsenal 3-1 West Ham United: Injured Gabriel Jesus is helping Eddie Nketiah, says Mikel ArtetaOne of the key questions as the Premier League returned was how the Gunners would cope without key striker Jesus.The Brazil international had knee surgery after being injured in Qatar and is expected to be out until late February, fuelling talk the Gunners might need to sign some cover.But against West Ham, a first Premier League start of the season was handed to Nketiah - and the 23-year-old delivered.After stretching the Hammers defence and creating space with his sharp movement, he capped an impressive all-round performance with a fierce finish and staked his claim to be Jesus' replacement.""Gabby will be a big miss but we all believe in Eddie,"" Saka told Amazon Prime. ""That's all he needs, us to keep supporting him and we will keep encouraging him.""Everyone in the team is chipping in [with goals] and everyone will be important.""Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah has scored 11 goals in his last 11 starts at Emirates StadiumIn contrast to the leaders, West Ham are struggling in front of goal.They have been better than their league position suggests, according to their expected goals statistics, with converting chances being their main problem.Few opportunities came against Arsenal, although the game might have panned out differently had Michail Antonio not been denied by Aaron Ramsdale shortly after the restart at 1-0.Hammers manager David Moyes said before the match he has not been feeling pressure because of results, instead urging for perspective and togetherness across the club.But a fourth straight league defeat leaves West Ham as one of the cluster of teams packed tightly together in the bottom half.Arsenal 3-1 West Ham: Hammers conceded  dreadful goals - Moyes""I don't think we're in a relegation fight.

Referee Craig Pawson could have stopped the game when Tarkowski went down holding his head in the lead-up to Bournemouth's second goal, while Cook was perhaps fortunate to only be booked for a lunge on Amadou Onana.However, Lampard can have few complaints with the result, with Bournemouth wasting a number of chances to make the scoreline even more painful for the Everton boss in the second half.Bournemouth go into break on a highGary O'Neil says he is 'proud' of Bournemouth playersThis could have been O'Neil's last game in charge, with Bournemouth having held talks with Marcelo Bielsa about becoming Scott Parker's permanent successor.If that proves the case, O'Neil will bow out on a high note after two quick-fire wins over the Toffees to end a run of four straight defeats, sending the supporters into the World Cup break in buoyant mood.Two of those previous defeats - against Tottenham and Leeds - saw the Cherries concede two-goal leads, but they were never in any danger of conceding that advantage here, with a first clean sheet in eight games completing a perfect afternoon.They could have added to their tally in the second half, but Solanke spurned two decent opportunities before having a goal disallowed for a marginal offside, while Philip Billing drilled just wide late on.As well as a new manager, Bournemouth could have new owner when the Premier League resumes, with US businessman Bill Foley progressing with his takeover of the south coast club.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63523919

""To go 1-0 down in every game is not positive. For this reason I want to see the positive side because my players showed great will and desire to win the three points.""Defensive frailties prove Leeds' undoingHaving recovered from 3-1 down to defeat Bournemouth last weekend, Jesse Marsch's team were given a taste of their own medicine at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.This was a game that showcased Leeds' technical qualities and defensive vulnerabilities in equal measure.They could have been further ahead by the time Kane fired Spurs level for the first time in the match, Summerville having been denied by Lloris moments beforehand.While the England captain's strike was controversial - Leeds felt Meslier was fouled in the build-up to the goal - Kristensen and Meslier will be bitterly disappointed not to have kept out Davies' hopeful effort, particularly after the Leeds keeper had done well to deny Kane in the build-up.Rodrigo's crisp finish into the far corner put Leeds on course for another memorable three points, but they let their advantage slip through their grasp yet again in the final minutes.Adams' clumsy, late challenge on Davinson Sanchez resulted in a second yellow card for the United States international as the Yorkshire club's recent resurgence shuddered to a halt.""I'm gutted, I feel like someone has ripped my heart out,"" Marsch told BBC Match of the Day.

It was just precautionary, a little soreness on the side of the knee. He hasn't trained a lot this week. He's OK.""West Ham were more involved in the game after Maddison's departure but Craig Dawson gave away a penalty which was well saved by Lukasz Fabianski from Youri Tielemans' low drive.But Harvey Barnes finished off a lovely counter-attacking move when he slotted past Fabianksi to seal a third consecutive away win for the Foxes.Having won six games at home in the Premier League West Ham have now lost their last two on the spin at London Stadium, suffering defeat last weekend after conceding a last-minute goal to Crystal Palace.Moyes being under pressure is nonsense - RiceFollow all of Saturday's Premier League action and reactionBrendan Rodgers plays down James Maddison injury worriesLeicester earn third consecutive win on the roadWest Ham 0-2 Leicester City: James Maddison will be fit for World Cup - Brendan RodgersBoth West Ham and Leicester came into the game completely evenly matched with four wins, two draws and eight losses.Leicester, who have not conceded a goal in their last three away wins, got off to a fast start having beaten Newport in the Carabao Cup earlier this week.Barnes drove forward and did well to keep the ball in play, his cut-back to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall shifted along to Patson Daka, who miscued his kick but which turned into the perfect tee-up for Maddison to hammer it into the roof of the net from 10 yards.That strike took Maddison (40) past Riyad Mahrez (39) in Leicester's leading Premier League goalscorers, behind only forward Jamie Vardy (134).The visitors had a terrific effort from range when Daniel Amartey ambled through the middle of the pitch and hit a rocket from 20 yards out, forcing a big save from Fabianski before Tielemans' penalty miss.The second half brought wholesale changes for Brendan Rodgers' side as they looked to see the game off and substitute Ayoze Perez set up Barnes, who has scored in all five of Leicester's victories this season, to slide home.The Foxes defended resolutely and were ultimately more efficient with their chances, and have now won four of their last five Premier League games after winning just one of their first 10 this season.Visit our Leicester City pageGo straight to all the best West Ham contentWest Ham's form dips before breakWest Ham 0-2 Leicester - We know we need to do better, says David MoyesFollowing their surprise loss to Blackburn on penalties in the Carabao Cup, West Ham started the game tentatively and were forced into an early substitution when Kurt Zouma, who had pulled up in the warm-up but still started, was unable to continue and was replaced by Nayef Aguerd, making his Premier League debut.Following Maddison's departure, West Ham improved as Jarrod Bowen saw his shot from range deflected over the bar and Lucas Paqueta headed wide after hammering a shot over from outside the area.Tomas Soucek had the ball in the back of the net from Bowen's cut-back but it was overruled for an offside.The Hammers were just finding their feet in the game when referee Jarred Gillett was advised to go to the monitor after Dawson clattered into Daka, as the Zambian tried to shift the ball onto his left foot.But Tielemans' resulting penalty was poor and well saved by Fabianski to keep the difference to one.The Hammers had 10 attempts to Leicester's four in the second half, with one coming when Declan Rice made a decisive run from his own half and played wide to Thilo Kehrer, who sent a teasing ball across the six-yard box but Gianluca Scamacca couldn't finish the move.West Ham weren't clinical enough with the chances they had and that, coupled with Leicester's superb defensive performance, culminated in David Moyes' side's ninth loss of the season before the Premier League breaks for the World Cup.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63523922
26,Newcastle United 1-0 Chelsea: Magpies continue winning run,SAT 12 Nov 2022,premier-league,"Joe Willock scored his second goal of the season for NewcastleNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said he would be ""foolish not to be excited"" by the second half of the season after a statement win over Chelsea which keeps his side third in the Premier League. Having slipped to fourth following Tottenham's win over Leeds earlier in the day, Joe Willock's delightful goal moved the Magpies back to third meaning they will be in a Champions League place at Christmas for the first time since 2001.A fifth successive Premier League victory, against an admittedly out-of-form Chelsea, was achieved with England striker Callum Wilson starting on the bench after illness, and with a solidity and fluency that their opponents could not match.Having worked Graham Potter's side hard in the first half, and after Sean Longstaff wasted two great chances shortly after the break, Willock finally found a breakthrough when he curled in from 18 yards following a surging run by Miguel Almiron.A youthful Chelsea, without Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Raheem Sterling, improved in the second half after the introduction Christian Pulisic.The American's run led to a Conor Gallagher shot, which was well saved by Nick Pope, but they could not break down a well-drilled Newcastle.After Liverpool's win over Southampton, Chelsea's third consecutive Premier League defeat means they have slipped to eighth in the table, eight points behind fourth-placed Tottenham.Asked if he was excited by what was in store when the Premier League resumes on Boxing Day, Howe said: ""When you're in our current position you'd be foolish not to be. I'm excited by what can be, while respecting the quality of the league. ""We haven't thought about any permutation or any consequence of the games. We've just tried to win them and I think that's the best way for us to attack the second half of the season as well."" Newcastle already built for European challengeNewcastle 1-0 Chelsea: Eddie Howe praises ""sky-high"" spirit after winThis was a match that once again underlined the rapid progress made by Howe's side in the 13 months since the club's takeover, and the team celebrated with their fans at the final whistle following a robust end to the game, when some steaming challenges were exchanged. Those confrontations continued after full-time with an altercation between Dan Burn and Kai Havertz, and angry Chelsea players maintained their arguments as they departed the field.But after a lap of the pitch, the Newcastle players headed down the tunnel with huge smiles on their faces after a win that could make their fans dream of a European campaign next season, maybe even in the Champions League. For long periods, they showed greater fluency than their opponents, perhaps in keeping with a more consistent team selection than Chelsea, and the result of having Bruno Guimaraes in the fulcrum of their midfield.But with Chris Wood starting in place of Wilson up front, Newcastle failed to truly test Chelsea before the break, with top scorer Almiron flashing a volley over and Gallagher blocking a Dan Burn shot. They also had a penalty appeal waved away by referee Robert Jones after the ball struck Trevoh Chalobah. The hosts should have taken the lead shortly after half-time when Almiron's cross was nodded back by Joelinton, with Longstaff having his effort saved by Mendy and then firing over.But another dart from Paraguayan Almiron, who has scored seven goals in seven games, helped set up Willock's curling strike to send St James' Park into raptures.For two teams that have recently gone through takeovers, perhaps it is no surprise that Newcastle seem more advanced than Chelsea given they are six months further into their new-found status.The new owners have preached that their evolution will take time, but the result, performance and feeling around the ground on Saturday suggested Howe's side are already built to challenge the Premier League hierarchy.Chelsea's season unravellingNewcastle 1-0 Chelsea: Busy schedule 'took its toll', says Graham PotterWhile Newcastle fans basked in the glory of a 10-game unbeaten run as they headed home, Chelsea supporters will wonder what is becoming of their side as they suffered a third consecutive loss in all competitions, excluding penalty shootout defeats, for the first time since 2002. Potter admitted afterwards that ""a lot of learning had happened"" since he was appointed two months ago. There was plenty of effort from the visitors, but once again an unpredictable Potter team selection looked disjointed, with their injury situation summed up by three players performing at right wing-back at different points during the game. There was little they could do about Ruben Loftus-Cheek's early injury, but after Cesar Azpilicueta was withdrawn at half-time, Gallagher slotted into the position - and came closest to scoring for Chelsea. Potter's side also included Lewis Hall, making his Premier League debut at left wing-back, and had Almiron for company. But the 18-year-old still had chances to attack in support of Gallagher, Mason Mount and Armando Broja further forward.He set up Broja for a shot that failed to test Pope in the Newcastle goal, and played a part in another attack, where Sven Botman headed away as Broja almost connected with Mount's cross. Chelsea had Thiago Silva to thank for steering them through the first half after the Brazilian replaced Loftus-Cheek early on, but Newcastle's second-half pressure finally told. Pulisic was one of the few bright sparks and his running helped the visitors pin back Newcastle, but their desperation in search of an equaliser led to the unsavoury scenes at the end and pointed to an unhappy Chelsea camp with further questions for Potter. The Blues boss said the club had experienced an ""incredibly challenging period"" with a busy run of games and injuries to key players. ""It's not nice to not get results, it's as simple as that,"" he said. ""But I have to look at why that is and the situation that we've had to deal with. It hasn't been straightforward at all."" Asked if the break came at a good time, he added: ""We have to see it that way. We have to use it as a positive and as I said we'll have a couple of players back, we need time to refocus, reflect and get ready for the second half of the season.""

27,Wolves 0-2 Arsenal: Martin Odegaard double puts Gunners five points clear at the top,SAT 12 Nov 2022,premier-league,"Martin Odegaard's fifth and sixth Premier League goals of the season took Arsenal to victory at MolineuxArsenal manager Mikel Arteta says everyone is shocked at the Gunners surging five points clear at the top of the Premier League but that he is determined his players should enjoy their present lofty status.Martin Odegaard's second-half double in their win over Wolves was enough for Arsenal to take maximum advantage of Manchester City's shock defeat by Brentford and ensure they will be top on Christmas Day for the first time since 2007.It is a major achievement for a club that has not finished higher than fifth since 2016.""Obviously nobody expected us to be where we are right now,"" said Arteta. ""But it's great to be where we are and we are enjoying that moment.""Odegaard turned home Fabio Vieira's low cross from close range 10 minutes after the restart and then drilled in the rebound after Jose Sa had kept out Gabriel Martinelli's low effort 15 minutes from time.It meant there was no slip-up for the Gunners, who watched City's defeat on the team coach as they travelled to the Midlands and celebrated when Ivan Toney scored in injury time.""As you can imagine,"" said Arteta, when asked about the reaction. ""But that's the way that you live this league and that's the beauty. You start to do that on the second game of the season because the competition is so big that you're always looking at other opponents. It's something that every team does.""There was more good news from the Arsenal camp as Arteta revealed Granit Xhaka's first-half exit was down to a sickness bug that affected the visitors before kick-off, rather than anything that would put the Switzerland player's World Cup in jeopardy.In contrast, Wolves are now bottom as new manager Julen Lopetegui prepares to take charge.The former Spain, Real Madrid and Sevilla boss was introduced 15 minutes before kick-off at Molineux and watched the game from the stands.He saw a microcosm of Wolves' season given the hosts battled hard and produced some opportunities despite spending much of the game on the back foot, but were undone by a lack of goal threat as they failed to score for the eighth time in 15 top-flight games.Reaction from Wolves v Arsenal and all of Saturday's other Premier League gamesVisit our Wolves pageGo straight to all the best Arsenal contentOdegaard could be Arsenal's title keyOdegaard has impressed since being appointed Arsenal captainTwelve victories and 37 points represents Arsenal's best record 14 games into a season.They do still have to play defending champions City as their first planned league game against them was called off last month to allow the Gunners to get up to date with their Europa League programme.They also have to face an in-form Newcastle, but they have met all the rest of their 'big six' rivals and look very much the real deal.Odegaard in particular has proved an inspired choice as captain by Mikel Arteta.The 23-year-old Norwegian goes about his work in a quietly effective way, clean in his passing and astute in terms of his positioning, which given his central role is essential.He is a goal threat too. His first was a poacher's effort as he evaded the attentions of Wolves defenders despite his proximity to the home goal. His second involved superb first-touch control as the ball ran out to him, then a precise finish.Much has been made of Erling Haaland's likely impact for City after the World Cup, given Norway's absence means he will be resting when so many influential players are in Qatar. The same is also true of Odegaard.Wolverhampton 0-2 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta praises fans as Arsenal go five points clearLopetegui's scoring problemAs no Premier League season has reached Christmas Day with so few fixtures played, comparisons to previous years must come with an asterisk.And before Arsenal's supporters get too excited, it is 1947 since they were top and went on to become champions, which now has to be the aim.At the other end, only three clubs in the Premier League era have escaped the drop after being at the foot of the table. If there is a shining light at the end of that particular tunnel for Wolves, the last team to do it were Leicester, who went on to become champions the following season.Chairman Jeff Shi has less lofty aims judging by his programme notes, where he admitted he doesn't 'expect to start winning straight away', which is a novel approach. There has been no word from Wolves about Lopetegui's contract but it would be a major surprise if it did not contain an escape clause on both sides at the end of the season should the managerial change fail to work as hoped. No manager can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear though. And while Adama Traore's pace caused Arsenal problems and Goncalo Guedes produced one of his more effective displays, Wolves did not find the net. They have scored only eight times in the league this season, by far the worst return in the top flight.Diego Costa will be back after suspension once domestic combat resumes following Qatar 2022, although whether that will be enough to save Wolves is debatable.Wolverhampton 0-2 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta praises fans as Arsenal go five points clear",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63523921

There was a positive atmosphere around Villa Park before kick-off, and Emery was loudly cheered as he took his place in the dugout.Those cheers had barely died down when Villa made the best possible start.Emery's impact was immediately clear as his side played with a pace and dynamism that pulled Manchester United apart.On the touchline, the Spaniard kicked every ball and did not stop giving instructions as he settled into his new job quickly. If this is a sign of things to come for Villa under, it won't be long before they are no longer looking over their shoulders.Ronaldo captaincy return doesn't go as plannedEyebrows were raised before kick-off when Ronaldo was named captain less than three weeks after he walked out of Old Trafford before full-time in the game against Tottenham.That initially appeared to mark the end of his time at the club, but Ronaldo has been gradually reintroduced by Ten Hag, who challenged the Portugal international to lead by example on Sunday.Ronaldo was not as influential as his manager would have perhaps liked, although no Manchester United player covered themselves in glory in their dreadful start to the game.The United captain was involved in a tussle with Tyrone Mings in the second half, and showed his frustration when he had the chance to fire home a trademark free-kick at 3-1, but slammed it into a wall.There were then pantomime boos as Ronaldo threw his hands into the air after being penalised for a foul late on to complete a day to forget for the veteran forward and Manchester United.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443729

The transformation under Howe's leadership has been remarkable.He took over with Newcastle 19th in the top flight, five points from safety after 11 games last season.Now they are mounting a challenge for Champions League football next season, while Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola even ranks them among the title challengers.Nobody has epitomised Newcastle's improvement under Howe more than Almiron.T﻿he Paraguay international has been one of the star performers in recent weeks, driving the team forward with intelligent runs and scoring a hatful of eye-catching goals.The opener at Southampton was another illustration of his thriving confidence. Picking the ball inside the home half, he burst forward with purpose and showed determination to hold off a challenge from Ainsley Maitland-Niles before finding the bottom corner with Newcastle's first shot on target.That set the platform for the visitors - who had to withstand periods of pressure - to go on and earn what was eventually a comfortable win.Howe was not entirely happy with his side's overall performance, saying it was not at the ""same heights"" as previous weeks. After an emphatic win that moved them third, it shows how high expectations have quickly risen under Newcastle's new regime.Since the start of October, no player has scored more Premier League goals than Miguel Almiron. The Newcastle forward has scored seven goals in that time, level with Manchester City's Erling HaalandSame old problems for wasteful SouthamptonSouthampton started the day in the relegation zone after Leicester won on Saturday and remain there after a display which summed up their current woes.Scoring goals has been the problem for Hasenhuttl's side, having netted only 12 times in 14 league games, and they failed to heed the Austrian's warning they needed to be more clinical.The Saints had their chances against the meanest defence in the league, but they were unable to take them and it proved costly.Their best opportunity saw Mohamed Elyounoussi miss a chance to equalise before half-time with an opportunity he would have expected to convert.Slick interplay on the right allowed Stuart Armstrong to deliver a low cross behind the Newcastle defence, Elyounoussi showing the anticipation to reach the ball first but not the composure to finish.Southampton showed further improvement after the break, but again wasted more presentable chances. Che Adams struck a volley cleanly but past the wrong side of the post and seconds later Southampton were punished when Wood converted Newcastle's second.By the time Perraud did make a breakthrough it was far too late and Hasenhuttl, who looked exasperated on the touchline, was again left ruing his side's profligacy. ""We had a tough game, they had seven shots on goal, four on target and they scored four goals,"" said Hasenhuttl.""We had 16, five on target and scored one.""They have shown why they are where they are. They were clinical in the right moments.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443730

This was the first time they dropped points at home since August.West Ham led when Said Benrahma marked his 100th appearance for the club with a powerful strike from outside the box.That goal came slightly against the run of play, but Wilfried Zaha drilled in an equaliser for Palace after good work from Eberechi Eze.The Hammers were awarded a penalty with 10 minutes to go with Marc Guehi making minimal contact with Michail Antonio - although that decision was overturned after a video assistant referee review.Antonio wasted a good attack late on when his poor cross was caught by Vicente Guaita and seconds later Olise won the game for Palace.

The only away win they had managed this season until now was at Oxford in the Carabao Cup.But then Olise was the hero in the fourth minute of injury time with a fortuitous deflected goal. In one of those quirks of football, this was his first Premier League goal since netting in the last minute against the same opposition on New Year's Day - although that was a defeat.Extra frustrating for West Ham is the fact Antonio could have helped set up a winner - or take the ball to the corner - seconds earlier.Eze had a few chances to score early on, forcing a save from Lukasz Fabianski with a free-kick and firing two shots wide, as well as dragging two shots wide.This was probably his last chance to impress boss Gareth Southgate, who names his World Cup squad on Thursday. He did well for the Eagles equaliser though, taking the ball off Thilo Kehrer, who struggled to control Craig Dawson's overhit pass, before feeding Zaha to score.That was Zaha's first away goal at West Ham in nine attempts. His goal was a welcome relief after Benrahma's opener against the run of play following Palace's good start. That one was set up by Lucas Paqueta on his return from a collarbone injury.Dawson almost accidentally won the game for Palace as he blocked a cross with his keeper Fabianski doing well to keep it out.West Ham did not create enough clear-cut chances after that to make it seven home wins in a row for the first time since 1999.In fact, Palace keeper Vicente Guaita only made one save all day - to deny Kehrer in the second half.They did think they were going to have a chance to win it when Antonio ran from halfway before feeling a slight bit of contact from Guehi's arm and going theatrically down.Referee Paul Tierney pointed to the spot, but realised his mistake when he saw the incident again on the screen.And then Olise struck from Zaha's pass.This game came just three days after West Ham played in Romania in the Europa Conference League, a 3-0 win at FCSB, but with 11 changes made it would be hard to blame that for this performance.West Ham United 1-2 Crystal Palace: Hammers 'shot themselves in the foot' - David Moyes",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443728
32,Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Liverpool: Mohamed Salah scores double in Reds win,SUN 06 Nov 2022,premier-league,"Mohamed Salah has now scored 14 goals in all competitions this seasonMohamed Salah struck twice in the first half as Liverpool secured their first away win in the Premier League this season with victory at Tottenham.Liverpool had lost their two previous league games to struggling Nottingham Forest and Leeds United, so manager Jurgen Klopp will be delighted with this win at Spurs, who are shaping up as rivals for a place in the top four.Salah was the inspiration, sweeping home a sharp left-foot finish from Darwin Nunez's pass after 11 minutes, then cashing in on Eric Dier's misplaced headed back-pass to double Liverpool's advantage with great composure five minutes before the break.Spurs, without the injured Son Heung-min, were never out of the game as Ivan Perisic hit the woodwork either side of half-time before Harry Kane pulled one back with 20 minutes remaining.But they failed to complete one of the comebacks that have become their trademark this season.Follow reaction to Sunday's Premier League gamesKlopp joy after 'massive game'Liverpool dig deep for victoryLiverpool got their stuttering season back in some sort of shape with the Champions League win against Napoli in midweek to reach the last 16 once again, although in reality that match was little more than a dead rubber.This victory, their first league away win of the season, carries greater significance because of the opposition and also the need to get their Premier League show back on the road after two damaging losses.Salah showed he is right back to his best after a slow start to the campaign. Both goals featured different elements of a goalscoring masterclass, the first with one touch and an instant finish, the second showing coolness and technique to make Dier pay for his error.Last season's joint Golden Boot winner had endured a slow start by his own high standards with only five goals during the first two months but now has 11 in his last 12 matches.Boss Jurgen Klopp said: ""Even in this slow start, Mo was involved in the most chances in Europe but we didn't take them or he didn't take them and it can happen for a striker, it is a completely normal phase.""But everyone knows when you look back at his career, everybody will remember one of the best strikers you ever saw because the numbers will be absolutely insane.""Tonight what pleased me the most is he scored the two goals and then he played like a real, real team player.""Liverpool also rode their luck as those Perisic efforts hit the woodwork, and Trent Alexander-Arnold was fortunate to escape when Spurs appeals for a penalty were waved away after he appeared to push Ryan Sessegnon to the ground. They are still conceding too many chances.Nunez was a tireless, constant threat, while Ibrahima Konate's return has added steel to a Liverpool defence that has been vulnerable at times this season. Goalkeeper Alisson was, as usual, reliability and excellence personified, and the reaction at the final whistle demonstrated just how important this win might be for Liverpool.Spurs pay for mistakesTottenham once again made life difficult for themselves by falling behind early when Liverpool took advantage of the wide open spaces on the home team's right flank, which had been exposed several times even before they went behind.In the final reckoning, however, it was Dier's mistake that left them with a hill that was too steep to climb, even in a season when they have been comeback specialists.This was not a Spurs side that only showed up in the second half, as has happened before this season, because they had responded well to Salah's early goal before Dier made his ill-advised attempt to head the ball back to keeper Hugo Lloris. Instead, he only diverted it off his shoulder and into the path of the unmarked Salah, with inevitable results.Spurs also had a clear case for a penalty, their frustration increasing when referee Andy Madley awarded a free-kick for an almost identical incident shortly afterwards.Even without the injured Son, Spurs dominated most of the second half but could not take advantage of the opportunities they created, with Dejan Kulusevski showing what they have been missing when he returned from injury to set up Kane's goal moments after coming on.Spurs showed plenty of heart and character, but ultimately paid the price for gifting Salah the goal that meant Liverpool were always able to stay just out of reach.Manager Conte started his press conference by reopening old wounds after Klopp had criticised his style of football following their draw back at Anfield last season.""Before I answer your question, Jurgen was happy for the way we played tonight? Yeah? No, because it was important to know his opinion,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443731

34,Man City 2-1 Fulham: Injury-time Erling Haaland penalty sends defending champions top,SAT 05 Nov 2022,premier-league,"Erling Haaland has now scored 18 Premier League goals this seasonSubstitute Erling Haaland scored an injury-time winner from the penalty spot to give 10-man Manchester City victory over Fulham and send the defending champions top of the table.The importance of his 95th-minute strike was underlined moments later when Haaland was embraced by his manager Pep Guardiola at the final whistle, and joined his team-mates on a lap of honour.What appeared as though it would be a frustrating and potentially costly afternoon in City's pursuit of a third-successive title, instead ended with a memorable victory thanks to Haaland's 18th league goal of his dazzling start to his career at Etihad Stadium.All seemed to be going according to plan for Guardiola's side early on, as they took the lead through Julian Alvarez's powerful finish and pressed forward looking for more goals.But the anticipated march to a seventh successive home win this season did not transpire. Instead the game took an unexpected turn just before the the half-hour mark when Joao Cancelo muscled Fulham forward Harry Wilson off the ball in the box.Referee Darren England pointed to the spot and showed Cancelo the red card, to the disbelief of Guardiola and his players, before Andreas Pereira sent Ederson the wrong way from the spot.That was Fulham's first effort at goal and they rarely threatened afterwards either, even with the extra man, instead being content to sit deep and frustrate their hosts.It initially appeared they would be successful, even when Haaland came off the bench in the second half after two games out injured.Haaland thought he had scored the winner when he headed home a Kevin de Bruyne cross with 15 minutes to go, but the home side's celebrations were cut short when VAR showed he was offside.City's attacks grew increasingly frantic towards the end and Haaland got no closer to finding the net, until Antonee Robinson tripped De Bruyne inside the area in injury time.Haaland - who else? - stepped up to fire his penalty into the bottom corner, despite the best efforts of Bernd Leno, and spark wild celebrations from his team-mates, manager and in the stands.Follow Saturday's live Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Manchester City contentVisit our Fulham pageHaaland comes off the bench to save the dayManchester City 2-1 Fulham: One of the best performances in my seven years - Pep GuardiolaCity have now won all seven of their home league games this season, but they have never left it as late as this to secure victory.Their frustration at the way this game was panning out was demonstrated by Bernardo Silva's outburst at England before half-time when the referee failed to book Wilson for a foul - which earned Silva a booking instead.The clamour for Haaland's introduction grew as the second half went on, with City dominating possession but failing to find a way through Fulham's massed defence.Haaland and Phil Foden were both introduced on their rescue mission in the 63rd minute but it appeared they would find it just as difficult to make the breakthrough.Haaland's first effort was an air-shot as he completely missed Ilkay Gundogan's knockdown and his second flew a mile wide, although in his defence he was at full stretch to reach a John Stones cross at the far post.His disallowed goal appeared likely to be a part of the story of two points dropped for his side, but City kept coming forward and finally got their reward right at the end of the game.Fulham will feel hard done byManchester City 2-1 Fulham: Erling Haaland injury-time winner was cruelFulham came within seconds of claiming what would have been a draw that few people gave them a chance of getting at kick-off.Their prospects had hardly been helped by a late ankle injury to top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, which ruled the Serb out of their squad. Not for the first time this season, however, Marco Silva's side exceeded expectations. Their penalty and Cancelo's red card were a huge help of course, but Silva stuck to the same plan to keep his team compact and hit City on the break even when it was 11 men vs 10.The four-game unbeaten run that had taken the Cottagers up to seventh in the table is over, but the spirit and organisation that Silva's side showed in the second half bodes well for tests to come.

Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo converted a controversial penalty and Yoane Wissa chipped goalkeeper Dean Henderson to put Brentford on the brink of their first away win of the season.But a scramble in the box in the 96th minute eventually saw the ball cross the line, the final touch coming off Brentford defender Jorgensen.Saturday's Premier League action - reactionForest scramble for hard-earned drawCooper criticises Brentford penalty decisionForest have opened the scoring in five of their six home matches this season but have gone on to lose three of those games and drawn one.Despite extensive investment over the summer, they remain rooted to the foot of the league with the worst goal difference, having scored 10 and conceded 30.Gibbs-White, signed in the summer for a club record £25m, was lively however and had a chance to open the scoring when he strode forward and found Brennan Johnson, whose well-struck shot was saved by David Raya before Ben Mee hooked a leg in to make a crucial clearance.Forest had a shout for a penalty when Josh Dasilva shoved Ryan Yates but a VAR check deemed there was not enough in it.Gibbs-White's run and finish after 20 minutes nevertheless gave the hosts a lead they looked poised to take into the break only for Forest keeper Henderson to concede a contentious penalty deep into first-half stoppage time. Wissa ran on to a looping ball from midfield and Henderson stuck a glove out to try and scoop the ball up, but was deemed to have caught Wissa as the forward tried to take the ball around him. A lengthy VAR check eventually advised referee Andre Marriner to go to the monitor and he awarded the penalty that Mbeumo converted, much to the despair of Henderson and the home crowd.Forest struggled to create clear-cut chances to retake the lead and Wissa's goal with 15 minutes remaining appeared to have settled the result in the visitors' favour. But a frantic period of injury time saw Taiwo Awoniyi come close with a free header in the box before a cross from the right bounced around in the area and eventually came off the unlucky Jorgensen to send the City Ground into chaos.Go straight to the best Brentford contentVisit our Nottingham Forest pageBrentford agonisingly close to first away winFrank 'proud' of Brentford playersThis was the first ever top-flight meeting between these sides and Brentford struggled to get into the game in the first half, with Forest hemming them in and enjoying the better chances.The timing of the penalty, coming just before half-time, gave Thomas Frank's side a much-needed boost and Brentford looked more energetic in the second half, but neither side dominated and the point was probably what each deserved.The Bees have only kept one clean sheet in their last 23 away games, conceding 51 - 11 of those on their last three away days.They are now winless in seven away trips this season, having drawn four and lost three.Top scorer Ivan Toney was serving a one-match suspension, leaving Wissa and Mbeumo to deliver threat up front for the visitors, and the result means Brentford have now won just one of six Premier League games in which the England striker has been absent.

Especially with the way we play, I think we're getting in great areas.""It's just about us all contributing a little bit more. If we want a striker as good as Danny Welbeck then we need to spend £80-90m in my opinion in the English market. They don't exist, they're not out there.""We need to just get better and all of us take a bit of responsibility in the final third. It was nice to contribute a little bit more today.""Wolves appoint ex-Spain and Real Madrid boss Lopetegui Go straight to all of our Wolves contentVisit our Brighton pageA pulsating opening period had seen Wolves respond to falling behind to a rare Adam Lallana goal with Goncalo Guedes and a Ruben Neves penalty putting them 2-1 up.They then conceded an equaliser a minute from Japan international Kaoru Mitoma before the break.But Semedo's dismissal for a foul on Mitoma shortly afterwards changed the dynamic of the contest.Winger Mitoma was a pivotal figure in the game and it was his run into the box that created the opportunity for Gross' winner.The result leaves Wolves sitting second-bottom of the league with 10 points, while Brighton are sixth.Wolves' familiar flawsWolves received their second red card in as many games as Nelson Semedo was sent off.When Lopetegui analyses this game, he will see a number of flaws but will at least be buoyed by Wolves' character.In their last game at Brentford, they equalised two minutes after falling behind and it was the same against Brighton.Guedes' contribution to the Wolves side this season has been questionable but the £27.5m Portugal forward did well to stay on his feet, force his way into the box and drill his first goal of the season past Robert Sanchez to make it 1-1.When Neves put his penalty into the roof of the net, Wolves had gone from bottom of the table to out of the relegation zone completely.Yet the defensive issues Lopetegui must address as a priority were soon in evidence. Too often, they allowed Brighton players space close to their goal. Mitoma was unmarked when he headed home his first goal for the Seagulls at the far post. The last of Semedo's 96 starts for Barcelona was the 8-2 humiliation by Bayern Munich, so defending has never been the attacking fullback's strong suit. Wolves 2-3 Brighton: Steve Davis rues 'basic' Wolves defensive errors against SeagullsWhen he got the wrong side of Mitoma and half pulled, half clipped him to the ground on the edge of the box, his red card was inevitable.It was Wolves second red card in successive games and, with Diego Costa suspended and Raul Jimenez injured, the knowledge two completely untested teenage forwards were on the bench shows that bolstering the striking department must also be a priority for Lopetegui.Lallana's rare goalAdam Lallana scored a rare goal for BrightonUnlike when they lost 4-0 to Leicester and were booed off the pitch, with club officials singled out for criticism, home supporters offered appreciative applause for their team at the final whistle.Yet Brighton were deserved winners and, by completing successive triumphs following the success against Chelsea, Roberto de Zerbi has achieved something in his first month in charge that took Graham Potter three times as long to achieve as Brighton boss.Amazingly, Lallana only scored once in just over two seasons under Potter.Eighty-two previous goals from his time at Southampton and Liverpool suggests he is far better than that.And the composure the former England midfielder showed to open the scoring at the start of a chaotic half underlines that theory.Now 34, Lallana may not be capable of being the same player who was selected for England's 2014 World Cup squad but he could be a major influence in ensuring Brighton do not slip too far from their current sixth position.Wolves 2-3 Brighton: Roberto De Zerbi delighted with 'big, big, big win'",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63436264

James Tarkowski and Idrissa Gueye both produced blocks to deny the former Norwich man in the first half, before he rattled the woodwork with an ingenious effort midway through the second half.He did, however, set up both Leicester goals - the first of which was a contender for goal of the season from Tielemans.

""I've been waiting for it to come and thankfully it did.He added: ""It's a completely different energy around the club and the training ground. That puts me in a better headspace and I just feel really motivated now. ""I was struggling at times with more mental things. It wasn't really my own performance but other things off the pitch. That's the biggest difference from last season.""Too often last season, I wasn't in the right headspace for games. I wasn't surprised by some of the stuff that was happening.""Cristiano Ronaldo's name is naturally also on the list of players with 100 goals but having been given a starting spot because of Antony's injury, the Portugal forward failed to capitalise, wasting one excellent second-half opportunity after he had been sent into the penalty area by Rashford.In a thrilling finish, David de Gea made fantastic saves to deny Michail Antonio and Kurt Zouma, before, with almost the final move of the game, the goalkeeper surplus to Spain's requirements turned away a thunderous Declan Rice effort. The result was enough for the home side to extend their unbeaten run to eight matches and go fifth in the table, while West Ham's inconsistency outside European competition leaves them 13th, just three points above the relegation zone.Ten Hag delight at Man Utd's 'winning spirit'Reaction to Sunday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Manchester United contentVisit our West Ham pageRashford joins Man Utd's 100 clubRashford, whose goal came a day before his 25th birthday, could not be choosing a better time to find form given Gareth Southgate picks his England World Cup squad on 10 November.It was the first time he has scored in successive games since January and, with a bit more luck, might have taken his overall tally for the season beyond seven.Within the opening 16 minutes, he had three efforts. For the first, he had the confidence to nip in ahead of Ronaldo to take an early shot from Diogo Dalot's low cross, which went wide. Then his low shot was blocked by Tomas Soucek before it could threaten the West Ham goal before, finally, Rashford's header was saved by Lukasz Fabianski.His landmark goal owed much to the patience of Dalot, who refused to be rushed into a quick throw by Casemiro and instead waited for Eriksen, who played a one-two with Bruno Fernandes before delivering the most brilliant of crosses.Rashford drove another shot wide at the start of the second half but, apart from a Fred effort that came back off a post, the rest of the United heroes were at the other end of the pitch, with De Gea inspirational in keeping West Ham out.Maguire & Bowen trying to impress England boss SouthgateRashford was not on his own in needing to impress Southgate.This was Harry Maguire's first Premier League start since the four-goal humiliation at Brentford on 13 August and the Manchester United player will be quite pleased with his efforts.Clean sheets are always welcome for defenders but Maguire played with a calmness that has been missing in recent months.He was, however, also helped by West Ham manager David Moyes' decision to replace one main striker in Gianluca Scamacca for another in Michail Antonio, rather than use both of them in attack as the West Ham fans made it clear they wanted when the second-half substitution was completed.Jarrod Bowen was his usual industrious self and did bring one decent first-half save out of De Gea, although he would have been given offside had he scored. The pair came together in stoppage time as Maguire blocked Bowen's goal-bound shot.It was a shame for West Ham - and Bowen, who knows he cannot bank on selection given England's attacking options.

40,Leicester City 0-1 Manchester City: Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick puts Pep Guardiola's side top of Premier League,SAT 29 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Kevin de Bruyne has scored 25 of his 60 Premier League goals (42%) from outside of the box, only David Beckham (55%) and Christian Eriksen (44%) have a higher percentage of players to score at least 50 goalsManchester City moved to the top of the Premier League after Kevin de Bruyne's world-class free-kick broke down Leicester City's stubborn resistance at the King Power Stadium.Foxes' manager Brendan Rodgers had clearly set up his team to do a containing job on the reigning champions and it had worked effectively until De Bruyne curled a magnificent strike into the top corner from 25 yards four minutes after half-time.De Bruyne's goal was reward for City's dominance, even though they missed the killer touch of the absent Erling Haaland, who has been suffering from a fever and a foot injury.Leicester almost broke out of their defensive shell when Youri Tielemans struck a volley from a corner that was turned on to the bar by Manchester City keeper Ederson but ultimately they did not have enough attacking intent or quality to test Pep Guardiola's side.Arsenal can return to the top of the table with victory against Nottingham Forest at Emirates Stadium on Sunday but for now Manchester City are back in the position that has become such familiar territory in recent years.Man City overcome Haaland lossThe goals of Haaland have been the big storyline surrounding Manchester City's season so far but the brilliant Norwegian was missing here having suffered from illness and injury that forced his departure at half-time against former club Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in midweek.It was a chance to see how Manchester City compensated for his absence and in the first half, when Leicester City simply sat back and let the champions attack with the occasional counter-attacking threat of their own, the sheer physical presence and air of menace presented by Haaland would have been a welcome addition to their attacking efforts.And yet, even without Haaland, Manchester City demonstrated why they were the Premier League's biggest force years before his spectacular entry on to the scene by conjuring up a spectacular moment from another area to win this difficult fixture.It was De Bruyne, a rich seam of match-winning brilliance over the years, who delivered with a right-foot free-kick from 25 yards that was simply unstoppable, glancing off the frame of the goal, tantalisingly out of the reach of Leicester keeper Danny Ward.Manchester City then held firm, despite the main anxious moment of Tielemans hitting the bar, with the celebrations at the final whistle demonstrating their delight at overcoming a Leicester team who had been showing improved form.Guardiola praises match-winner De BruyneLeicester leave it too lateLeicester were never going to come out blazing against this potent Manchester City side but after the disappointing narrow loss there must be the sense they were risk-averse for too long.The Foxes were content to sit back in the opening half, giving every impression that if they were offered a draw at any point they would have shaken on it instantly.It was always going to be a problem to implement such a major change of gameplan once Manchester City scored - as they were always likely to do - and so it proved when De Bruyne turned on his magic just after half-time.The frustration for Leicester manager Rodgers was that when his side adopted an enforced positive approach they actually caused the visitors problems and unsettled their defence, as shown by the thunderous Tielemans strike touched on to the bar by Ederson and an incident in the dying seconds when John Stones directed a nervous header straight at Ruben Dias, the rebound flying narrowly wide of his own goal.Leicester's fans understood the approach, as proved by warm applause when they reached half-time goalless, but the cheers when Rodgers made positive changes and introduced strikers Kelechi Iheanacho and Patson Daka showed they also craved a more pro-active approach.In the end, their attempts to unsettle Manchester City came too late and the champions prevailed.Rodgers 'proud' of Leicester despite defeatFollow live updates from Saturday's Premier League actionVisit our Leicester City pageGo straight to all the best Manchester City content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63354924
41,Bournemouth 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Rodrigo Bentancur scores winner before important week,SAT 29 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Wales defender Ben Davies equalised for Tottenham with his first goal of the seasonTottenham manager Antonio Conte says fighting back to beat Bournemouth was ""vital"" for his side before the crucial Champions League trip to Marseille.The visitors showed hunger and resolve to recover from two goals down, clinching victory when second-half substitute Rodrigo Bentancur pounced quickest in the second minute of stoppage time.""It was great to see the desire of my players and the reaction they had,"" said Conte, whose side need a point at Marseille to reach the last 16. ""Also, the nastiness they put into the pitch because I have seen in the eyes of my players the desire to win this game.""It was important to win this game. I think we showed good character.""Initially Spurs were flat as Bournemouth looked set to end a run of two successive defeats.Wales international Kieffer Moore, making a rare start, swept the Cherries ahead following a flowing counter attack.His second was more about guts than guile as he outmuscled Emerson Royal to meet Adam Smith's cross with a powerful header which went in off the bar.Spurs rarely threatened before Ryan Sessegnon narrowed the gap with a cool finish into the bottom corner.That sparked a shift of momentum and Spurs levelled when home keeper Mark Travers made an unconvincing attempt at claiming a corner, allowing Ben Davies to head in from Ivan Perisic's delivery.Slicker, quicker passing saw Spurs continue to press and their improvement was rewarded when Bentancur reacted quickest to side-foot in from another set-piece.The relieved celebrations at the full-time whistle, from both the Spurs players and the travelling support, illustrated the importance of a morale-boosting win.""My feeling [when 2-0 down] was we still had the possibility to win this game,"" added Conte.""When we suffered in the first half I told my players it is on us. I asked for more personality, more responsibility and more decisions.""My players showed great character and great desire and didn't accept defeat. In the end we deserved to win because we created chances.""Follow reaction to Bournemouth v Spurs and the rest of Saturday's Premier League actionSpurs answer some questions before important trip to MarseilleTottenham remain third in the Premier League table after recovering to beat Bournemouth, yet lingering questions remain about the issues faced by Conte.With almost an hour on the clock, it looked like a bad week for Spurs - who were beaten by Manchester United and Newcastle before a controversial draw against Sporting stopped them securing a place in the Champions League last 16 - would get even worse.Discussion about whether the Italian's tactical style is stifling Spurs' attacking talent, and why they continue to start slowly, remain. But his side, which featured seven changes with one eye on the trip to Marseille, certainly cannot be accused of not showing fight.Spurs dominated possession in the first half but lacked creativity as they barely tested Bournemouth's stand-in keeper Travers.They were made to pay as Bournemouth took control but Sessegnon's strike, which came out of almost nowhere when he latched on to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's incisive pass, provided much-needed impetus.Conte has talked about his team being short of belief and, with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min relatively well contained, Spurs were unable to create a lot from open play.Eventually, it was set-pieces that provided the breakthrough and allowed Spurs to go to Marseille in higher spirits.O'Neil not worried despite third straight defeatThe mood around Bournemouth has been transformed by interim manager Gary O'Neil, who took over following the 9-0 defeat at Liverpool in August and immediately led the newly promoted Cherries to a six-game unbeaten run.Progress was stalled by back-to-back defeats at Southampton and West Ham, but it looked like O'Neil's side were going to get back on track against Spurs.For large periods they coped well with what Spurs managed to throw at them.But once Davies equalised after Travers was weak in coming off his line, the home defence suddenly looked uneasy in dealing with Spurs' set-pieces.Tottenham's 19th corner of the game, deep into stoppage time, led to second-half substitute Bentancur heading at a Cherries defender before firing in the rebound.""Conceding from set-pieces against a team like this is unforgivable,"" said Cherries defender Jordan Zemura, who took responsibility for not marking Davies tighter.""It's something we need to sort out. We know we need to be better. It is a collective.""Despite a third straight defeat, O'Neil - whose future is still unclear with the club's takeover by A﻿merican businessman Bill Foley close to being completed - said he was not unduly worried.""We've had some tough games, with this being the toughest,"" said O'Neil, who took over from Scott Parker following the heavy defeat at Anfield.""There is a gulf between us [and Spurs] and we did everything we could to close that gap. We made it competitive and Spurs had to dig very deep.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63354914

""When emotions are high it is difficult to discuss things, but we'll have a conversation with him next week.""Earlier, Ruben Neves' equaliser had cancelled out Mee's superb volley early in the second half to help Wolves to a point that moved them up one place to 18th.An attritional and injury-laden first half gave way to a livelier second period, with Brentford's Ivan Toney missing from close range late on.But the Bees' prolific striker was also booked for his fifth yellow card of the season, meaning he will miss their next outing against Nottingham Forest.Costa's costly rush of bloodBrentford 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Wolves 'battled and competed' to draw, says DavisCosta had been brought in specifically to improve Wolves' threat in front of goal, but no goals in six appearances and now an absence until the end of the year is not what the Wolves hierarchy or fans would have wanted.  He was Wolves' only fit frontline striker before kick-off, with Raul Jimenez absent since August with a groin problem. Jimenez is in Mexico's provisional squad for the World Cup and it remains to be seen if he will play in any of his club's three matches before the World Cup begins. ""It will open up doors for other players or maybe we will play in a different way,"" Davis added.Costa, 34, had become more of a threat as the game developed and forced David Raya into making a save with a shot from a tight angle, before being dismissed for the first time in the Premier League.His clash with Mee on the edge of Brentford's box late in the game was referred to VAR and when referee Bobby Madley consulted the pitchside monitor, it felt inevitable that the ex-Chelsea forward would see a straight red card.Last week's 4-0 defeat by Leicester City had featured chants from sections of Wolves' Molineux support aimed at technical director Scott Sellars, who was later defended by interim head coach Steve Davis.Visit our Brentford pageGo straight to the best Wolves contentAnd their struggles in front of goal this season, with only five scored before kick-off, continued with substitute Joao Moutinho coming closest in the first half when his volley direct from a corner was deflected away by Mee.

I think I did a good job at the club and left it in a good place.""Once the crowd were so engaged it was a difficult one for us. The scoreline is a painful one.""Kai Havertz nodded in Conor Gallagher's exquisite cross to give the visitors hope, but Pascal Gross capped a miserable afternoon for Potter and his players with a close-range finish after Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy parried Julio Enciso's shot into the German's path.Reaction to Brighton v Chelsea, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion contentVisit our Chelsea page'We have to take responsibility''A painful defeat'- Potter on Brighton returnAfter emerging from the Amex Stadium tunnel to a chorus of boos, matters only got worse for Potter as his side produced a defensive horror show to gift Brighton a dream start.In a chaotic opening, Trossard's calm finish put the home side in front after Thiago Silva - who had already produced two goalline clearances to deny the Seagulls - surrendered possession cheaply in his own half.Like Brighton's first, the hosts' second and third goals were entirely self-inflicted. Loftus-Cheek stuck out a knee to inadvertently steer Gallagher's flick-on into the net via the crossbar, before Estupinan's delivery was guided past his own keeper by the somewhat unfortunate Chalobah.""We didn't recover,"" Potter said afterwards. ""We have to take responsibility a bit for the first half. We have had a lot of football but that's no excuse. We couldn't quite get to that level.""Chelsea did have chances of their own - Christian Pulisic firing wide from a promising position and Robert Sanchez tipping Gallagher's looping header over the crossbar - but Havertz's header early in the second half failed to spark a revival and Gross finished off an incisive counter-attack late on to rub salt into the visitors' wounds.""Unfortunately we missed the pass or didn't execute it,"" the Chelsea boss continued. ""We didn't take our chances and they did.""It's part of the process, You have to suffer and feel pain in order to grow and get better. Nobody said we're the finished article. We have to take the pain today and learn from it.""'Our fans were the best player'We must continue to play at this level - De ZerbiA run of five games without a win since Potter's departure did not make pleasant pre-match reading for Seagulls supporters or their new coaching staff, but Chelsea were unable to cope with Brighton's high pressing in the early stages as De Zerbi's team threatened to run riot.Only Glenn Murray and Neal Maupay have scored more Premier League goals for the Seagulls than in-form Trossard, whose early opener - his 25th in the league for the club - made him the first player to score a team's first five top-flight goals under a new manager.Had it not been for Silva's two last-ditch clearances and a close-range Moises Caicedo effort which struck the outside of the post, Brighton could have been even further ahead by half-time.Their second-half display was more measured as Chelsea sought a route back into the game, but De Zerbi's side never looked like surrendering their healthy lead - even after Havertz's strike.""We must continue to play this level of football,"" De Zerbi said afterwards. ""We have to think only about the level of performance.""The atmosphere was fantastic. Our fans were the best player on the pitch and it is very nice to work in Brighton.

Southampton improved significantly in the second half and were unlucky not to find an equaliser as Che Adams and Stuart Armstrong both went close and Palace nervously held on to the three points.The defeat ends a run of three Premier League matches unbeaten for Southampton, who held then league-leaders Arsenal to a 1-1 draw last week.Palace sit 10th in the table, while Southampton are 16th, two points from the relegation zone.Reaction to Palace's victory over SouthamptonHead to all the best Palace contentCatch up with all the latest from SaintsPalace assert dominance as Southampton sit inPalace have to score more goals - VieiraPalace are unbeaten in four of their six home games this season with this their last in front of a home crowd before the World Cup break.It is their first clean sheet of the season at Selhurst Park and the first time since May 2018 they have earned three successive home wins.Aside from one early corner, which Palace keeper Vicente Guaita had to punch away, and a Che Adams shot which hammered off the post but was then pulled up for offside, Southampton were firmly under pressure throughout the first half.Palace should have opened the scoring earlier, when Eberechi Eze managed a neat little flick over his head to get the ball under control and out to Zaha, who drove forward and squared a wonderful ball across the box with Edouard mere inches away from getting a toe to it.Twice within the space of a few minutes Eze fired the same shot in from the outside the area - both times finding himself in acres of space. The first was well saved by Saints goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu, while the second went inches wide.""In the first half we were really good,"" Palace boss Patrick Vieira said. ""[We] played some good football, created chances but couldn't score. We should've gone into half-time with more goals and that is one of the sides of the game we have to improve.""Palace have had to come from behind in all of their Premier League victories this season until this one, and had also held a record of one draw and one loss when leading at half-time.Southampton continued to lose the ball in dangerous areas, with the majority of the game played in their own half.The Eagles had a goal struck off when Michael Olise released Edouard and the French forward tucked away a simple finish but Olise was offside in the build-up. However, Palace earned their just reward when Edouard slotted past Bazunu for his third goal of the season.""Southampton played really well in the second half and made it difficult for us,"" Vieira said. ""We needed to show something else and I'm pleased with the attitude in a difficult period. We started the second half a bit flat and it became more difficult for us to get any momentum.""When we are in a good period in the game we have to score more goals. The team is growing and those kind of games and playing under pressure will give us confidence and belief and we will learn from those games.""Saints' game of two halvesCrystal Palace 1-0 Southampton: Ralph Hasenhuttl praises Saints second-half performanceSouthampton started the second half much better as Adams attempted a shot from just inside the area, forcing Guaita to come out and make a brave stop before Armstrong fired from a tight angle and the Palace keeper was again called into action to prevent the ball sneaking in at the near post.Palace seemed unsettled by Southampton's attempts to press and as the second half went on Ralph Hasenhuttl's side, who have now lost six of their last 10 games, saw the better of the chances.Eze and Luka Milivojevic gave away the ball carelessly as sloppy mistakes crept in and Bazunu was a solid presence in the Southampton goal.As was the case against Arsenal, Saints were much improved after the interval as Adams went close again and James Ward-Prowse saw his shot from range go wide.Although it was a more even contest in the second period, Southampton, who have won eight points from losing positions in the league this season, were unable to snatch an equaliser as Armstrong had done against the Gunners.""We had better chances and with the chances you have in the second half you must take something, we had the bigger ones for sure and we know we have to score them,"" Saints boss Hasenhuttl said.""We win together and lose together and we will stand up again.""Palace had a chance to kill off the game in the closing stages when Jordan Ayew drove into the box but he was too slow in waiting for the right moment to pick out Zaha in the middle and sent the pass straight to the feet of a Southampton defender.A 4-0 loss at Manchester City earlier this month - Saints' fourth defeat in a row in the Premier League - increased the scrutiny on manager Hasenhuttl but a third successive game unbeaten had helped alleviate that pressure.However, Southampton's record when trailing at half-time now extends to one draw and five losses this season, and this defeat will be a tough one for the Saints boss to take as his side had ample opportunity to earn at least a point.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63354919

""I'm not sure how you're supposed to defend anymore,"" said Young. ""The referee said that's the rule but unless you're putting your arms by your side, it's not the right way to defend so you've got to defend in the way I did.""Wilson had a second goal ruled out for offside before the break, but doubled Newcastle's lead when he nodded a Kieran Trippier cross in from close range. Joelinton scored his first goal of the season, pouncing on the rebound after Olsen had denied Wilson his hat-trick and Almiron capped a fine Newcastle display, scoring for the third game running when he brilliantly curled a shot into the net.Newcastle continued to push for goals but Wilson and substitute Jacob Murphy were denied by the woodwork as the hosts were made to settle for four.

Having been assessed by Villa's medical staff, Martinez remained on the pitch. However, after being called into action to collect a cross 10 minutes later, the former Arsenal stopper stayed down and put his hands to his head.Following further assessment, a disconsolate Martinez was taken off with Olsen introduced for his first Villa appearance since the final day of last season.It is one of a number of issues for new Villa boss Unai Emery to examine when he officially takes charge on Tuesday.

46,Fulham 0-0 Everton: Jordan Pickford helps visitors earn point at Craven Cottage,SAT 29 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Jordan Pickford produced a string of fine saves to help Everton keep a fourth clean sheet this season. Only Manchester City and Newcastle United have had more, both with sixFulham extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to four matches but had to be content with just a point following another inspired display by Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.England's number one pulled off a string of fine saves to earn the visitors a fourth clean sheet of the season.Fulham's top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic had 10 efforts on goal but through a combination of good goalkeeping and errant finishing was unable to add to his tally of nine goals for the campaign.Frank Lampard believed the Serbia striker was lucky to see out the 90 minutes after escaping with just a yellow card following a strong first-half challenge on Idrissa Gueye.""It was a red card for Mitrovic,"" argued the Everton manager. ""I have nothing against him but he knew, he put his arm up straight away. VAR is there to deal with these things.""Willian was twice denied by Pickford on what was his 265th Premier League appearance, the most for any Brazilian in the English top flight.And the Cottagers had two penalty shouts turned down either side of the break, while Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin had an effort ruled out for a clear offside.The point moved last season's Championship winners back into seventh place, while Everton are 12th.Fulham 0-0 Everton: Lampard questions Mitrovic challenge following goalless drawFree-scoring Fulham kept at bayOnly Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham had scored more than Fulham's 22 goals in the Premier League going into this weekend's fixtures.Manager Marco Silva, facing Everton for the first time since being sacked by them in December 2019, says Fulham's form is merely a continuation of the attacking philosophy he put in place as they rattled in 106 goals on their way to the Championship title last season.But Pickford proved his rightful place as England's top stopper to keep Silva's free-scoring side at bay.He produced three saves in quick succession in a breathless start to the game, tipping over Willian's shot on the turn and Mitrovic's looping header before palming away a curling long-range effort from Harrison Reed.Everton striker Calvert-Lewin, whose return to the side following injury was hoped would boost their tally of just 11 goals in 13 games, also helped keep Fulham out, producing a headed goalline clearance.When Fulham did manage to breach the Everton rear-guard, Tim Ream's free header from Andreas Pereira's centre bounced just wide of Pickford's far post.Fulham did almost everything right - SilvaReferee John Brooks, backed up by brief VAR checks, ruled out two claims for Fulham penalties either side of the break - the first after James Tarkowski tangled with Bobby Decordova-Reid in the box, the second when Willian went down following a stretched challenge from Gueye. The pace noticeably dropped as Everton's own forays up-field tailed off and, despite their endeavour, Fulham's run of scoring in every home game of the season came to an end. Everton's defensive display combined with toothless attackMitrovic provided the game's only flashpoint midway through the first half, triggering a furious reaction from the Everton manager on the touchline after his studs-up tackle connected with Gueye's right ankle.The Serb claimed it was a genuine, if clumsy, attempt to win the ball, but Lampard felt it warranted a stronger punishment. ""Last year our midfielder Allan got a yellow, it was upgraded to red and he got a four-game ban. It was nowhere near as forceful as that one tonight. It was a red card and we haven't had those decisions this year,"" said the Everton boss.It was an uncharacteristic moment in what was an otherwise good-spirited match that acted as a microcosm of all that has been good and bad in the Merseysiders' start to the season.A resolute defensive display was undermined by a toothless attack as Lampard's side failed to score for the 11th time in his 31 Premier League games in charge.Calvert-Lewin's third start after returning from injury looked to have given the visitors a fresh impetus early on.Top scorer Anthony Gordon's close-range shot was blocked by Antonee Robinson and Bernd Leno tipped over Demarai Gray's stinging drive from the edge of the box in the opening five minutes.Gray also set up a good scoring chance for Calvert-Lewin, who just failed to connect properly with his superb low cross, while Tarkowski put a strong header straight at Leno.But in the closing stages Lampard's side looked to be more than happy to take the point, moving on to next Saturday's visit of Leicester.

Brentford, meanwhile, are 10th on 14 points. Follow Sunday's Premier League actionShackles off as Villa show immediate responseThis was an unbelievable display by a Villa team who had been struggling to score goals under Gerrard but, seemingly with the shackles off, they let loose on a stunned Brentford side.Before Sunday, Villa were the joint-second lowest goalscorers in the Premier League this season with seven, but in just 14 minutes they scored as many goals as they managed in 409 minutes under Gerrard.Their build-up play was fast and incisive, with Brentford struggling to close down the spaces and they could have won by an even bigger margin with both Luiz and Emi Buendia not far off with shots from distance.Danks, who had been assistant to Dean Smith prior to Gerrard's arrival, had also made a brave call before kick-off by benching captain John McGinn. His bold leadership may be just what Villa need - certainly in the short term - as they look to climb the table quickly.Aston Villa 4-0 Brentford: I had to pinch myself - interim boss Aaron Danks on dream start""I have been asked to lead the team at the moment and will continue to do that,"" Danks said. ""I will step forward Monday morning to prepare the team as we go and, until I hear otherwise, it is full focus and energy on that.""'Embarrassing' Bees' away struggles continueAston Villa 4-0 Brentford: Thomas Frank frustrated by early goals concededSunday's defeat was a completely unexpected result for Brentford, especially coming just four days after a fine display against Chelsea.This was probably one of the visitors' worst performances since they were promoted to the Premier League, with Thomas Frank's side largely limited to chasing shadows - particularly in the first half. Alarm bells shouldn't be ringing after this loss, which was more likely a consequence of a Villa response to Gerrard's departure coupled with an off day for Brentford, who are sitting pretty comfortably in 10th place.However, Brentford are still without an away win this season and striker Ivan Toney insists similar performances to this will be unacceptable.  ""Shambles, to be honest. Shambles,"" he said.""We were like a bunch of kids out there. I don't mind losing games but not like that.

It could well be the last this ground sees of the American.For Fulham, this represents another big feather in the cap. A second successive win was their fifth of this Premier League season - the same amount they managed in the entirety of their last top-flight campaign in 2020-21.

""Credit to Southampton as well. There are no complaints.""The effervescent Gabriel Martinelli had a shot deflected wide and Gabriel Jesus was denied by Southampton goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu as the visitors threatened to double their advantage before the interval.Ralph Hasenhuttl's team improved in the second half but needed a superb last-ditch challenge from Elyounoussi to deny Jesus, who had broken clear of the Southampton defence.Martin Odegaard thought he had put Arsenal back ahead not long after Armstrong's equaliser, but the Norwegian's effort was disallowed after the ball had gone out of play in the build-up.""We created big chances that we didn't put away,"" Arteta said. ""In the Premier League, when you don't do that when you're on top, you can pay the price.""We were really good in the first half and totally controlled the game.

""After that, you saw what happens when you have belief.""We had a few issues in the beginning with the shape, but we made some changes and it was much better. Considering we were 1-0 down, it's a good result.""Saints have won eight points from losing positions in the league this season - only Crystal Palace have collected more after falling behind.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63274131

Costa also saw other attempts blocked or deflected away.Daniel Podence was another to be denied by a brilliant Ward stop, while Ruben Neves fired a free-kick just wide at the start of the second half.By the time Leicester scored their third - James Maddison again pressing his claim for a place in England's World Cup squad with a lovely low strike from 18 yards out - Wolves had created, and missed, 20 opportunities.That Maddison goal came from only Leicester's third attempt of the match and they scored with their fourth too, Jamie Vardy scoring from close range following Timothy Castagne's cross, as they finally won away from home in the league after five successive defeats.Wolves v Leicester as it happened, plus reaction and analysisVisit our Wolves pageGo straight to all the best Leicester City content""We are growing nicely, but there is a long way to go,"" said Foxes manager Brendan Rodgers following his side's third win in five games after home victories against Nottingham Forest and Leeds earlier this month.""Collectively, we were very, very good.

Former Spain manager Julen Lopetegui and ex-Watford manager Rob Edwards have been interviewed, while former boss Nuno Espirito Santo, who took them into Europe, was linked with a return. And on Thursday, QPR boss Michael Beale rejected them, preferring instead to stay with the Championship leaders.Wolves chairman Jeff Shi then said lifelong Wolves fan Davis, in charge of coaching the club's under-18s before Lage was dismissed, would continue to be interim head coach ""until 2023"".Davis' side made a bright start in his fourth game in charge, but once again they could not convert their chances and their total of five goals in 12 games is the lowest in the division.Costa, Nunes, Hugo Bueno and Podence had shots saved or blocked and Joao Moutinho and Max Kilman narrowly missed the target on a frustrating day for the home fans.""We're in a battle,"" added Davis. ""It's early in the season and it has to change. We can't be saying this beyond the World Cup, we need to be getting points.""It's frustrating. Losing 4-0 at home is hard. I'm very disappointed for the fans and I feel their pain too.""Leicester scored four excellent goals from five shots and only a late missed header from substitute Marc Albrighton meant they failed to end the match with a 100% conversion record.Understandably, Rodgers was delighted with a much needed three points.""When we played the ball forward, we looked good and could have scored more goals,"" he added.""We broke forward really well.

They have scored at least three goals in all of them, something no side had done since Aston Villa, also across two seasons, in 1930 and 1931.Haaland now has an incredible 17 goals in 11 league games - and 12 in his past five home games.However, it was skipper Kevin de Bruyne who scored the best of the day, curling a superb shot into the top corner from 25 yards from Bernardo Silva's inside pass.It ended hopes of a Brighton comeback, which were raised after Leandro Trossard's second-half effort beat Ederson from the corner of the area.As it is, Brighton are still without a win under new boss Roberto de Zerbi, while Pep Guardiola's side close to within a point of leaders Arsenal.Reaction to Man City's win against Brighton, plus live coverage of Chelsea v Man UtdHaaland the scoring machineAfter failing to score at Liverpool last weekend, Haaland was on - for him - a barren run of two hours without a goal.His opener emphasised how much speed, power and awareness he has.City keeper Ederson deserves huge credit for launching a long ball from his penalty area over the top of the Brighton defence. Seagulls keeper Robert Sanchez dashed out of his goal but Haaland beat him to the ball and knocked it past him. Then he barged Adam Webster out of the way before rolling the ball into an empty net.It meant the longest Haaland has gone without a Premier League goal remains 148 minutes.Pretty soon, he had another as he drove home a penalty after the video assistant referee stopped play to rule Lewis Dunk had fouled Silva.That goal was Guardiola's 600th as City boss, a figure achieved in six and a half trophy-laden years that last week was marked by City being confirmed as 'Club of the Year' at the Ballon d'Or awards.Not everything was perfect for City. Riyad Mahrez missed a glorious chance to put them three ahead just before Trossard's goal after being set up by De Bruyne. The Algerian looked distinctly unimpressed as he was replaced by Phil Foden.And Aymeric Laporte needed treatment for an injury in stoppage time that might make him a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League trip to Borussia Dortmund.Man City had to be 'resilient' in Brighton win - GuardiolaBrighton complaintsThere were Brighton grievances against both City's first-half goals.Webster was still complaining to referee Craig Pawson at the break that he was fouled by Haaland for the opening goal, while central defensive partner Dunk argued that Silva kicked him rather than the other way round for the penalty.They were both debatable calls - and the type visiting teams need to go their way if they are to leave Etihad Stadium with anything.It was pretty obvious Brighton's fourth place in the table when Graham Potter left for Chelsea was a false one and there were some tough games to come.Nevertheless, that is two points from five games in charge now for De Zerbi before Potter's return to the Amex Stadium next Saturday.There have been subtle tweaks to Potter's team by the Italian, who wants Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister to get on the ball more often in midfield, but a familiar Brighton failing of not scoring enough goals is becoming evident once more.Trossard's goal fell into the speculative category. But he wasted Brighton's best chance to equalise when he sprinted into the box and, instead of trying to find a centrally placed team-mate, attempted to beat Ederson from an impossible angle.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63267139
57,Chelsea 1-1 Man Utd: Hosts remain above United after dramatic finale,SAT 22 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Casemiro's goal was his first for United since joining in the summerCasemiro's looping stoppage-time header gave Manchester United a deserved point in a dramatic finale against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.Jorginho's late penalty looked to have given Chelsea a narrow win when he sent goalkeeper David de Gea the wrong way from the spot after substitutes Scott McTominay and Armando Broja tangled at a corner three minutes from time.Defeat would have been harsh on United but they got the reward their performance merited when Casemiro rose to meet Luke Shaw's cross deep into six minutes of stoppage time, Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga getting a fingertip touch but unable to stop the ball crossing the line as it bounced back off the inside of the post.MOTD analysis: Why 'class act' Casemiro is the player Man Utd have been missingUnited, with Cristiano Ronaldo left out of the squad as a disciplinary measure following his refusal to come on as a substitute in the win against Tottenham, had the better chances as they dominated the first half.Erik ten Hag's side were well on top and far more dangerous, Kepa saving well from Marcus Rashford and Antony, the latter also missing a great chance when clean through.The second half was closer and concluded with that frantic finish, but the main worry for United now is an injury to defender Raphael Varane, who left the pitch in tears as he clearly fears for his World Cup chances with France.Managers condemn homophobic chanting at Stamford BridgeVarane suffers injury at Chelsea and leaves pitch in tearsReaction from Stamford BridgeDisappointment for Chelsea & PotterChelsea 1-1 Manchester United: Draw a fair result - PotterChelsea manager Graham Potter must have thought he was on the way to his second victory over United this season after Jorginho calmly slotted home late on.Potter, who won at Old Trafford with Brighton on the opening weekend, was also set to see his side earn a sixth successive clean sheet in all competitions until that late Casemiro intervention.In reality, however, Chelsea would have been fortunate to win. Indeed, so outmanoeuvred were they in the first half that Potter was forced into a tactical reshuffle to bolster his struggling midfield after only 36 minutes, Mateo Kovacic coming on for Marc Cucurella.Chelsea were grateful to goalkeeper Kepa in that period but they improved after the break - albeit they were still unable to force De Gea into any serious work, the one anxious moment for the visitors coming when Trevoh Chalobah's header glanced off the top of the bar.The hosts ultimately could muster just two shots on target in a game that failed to live up to its billing - but there will be real disappointment that they could not close out the win after taking the lead so late.Potter was at least able to maintain his unbeaten record as Chelsea manager but it could have been so much more satisfying.Man Utd boss Ten Hag can be satisfiedChelsea 1-1 Manchester United: Players' spirit pleases Erik ten HagTen Hag will be happy with a point after coming close to leaving with nothing. When the dust settles, however, he will know this was a missed opportunity.Rashford and Antony should each have done better when clean through and it looked like they would pay for their profligacy before the outstanding Casemiro's first goal for the club provided the sting in the tail. Ten Hag would have been bitterly frustrated at McTominay's rash tangle with Broja to concede the penalty and it was no surprise that the Scotland midfielder embraced Casemiro in sheer relief at the end.United's manager has brought clear improvements to the team, who now press more effectively and play with more intensity.He has also dealt firmly and strongly with Ronaldo's insubordination, leaving him out of the squad here to deliver a clear message clear that there will only be one man making the decisions at Old Trafford.However, United will worry about Varane, who collapsed with what looked like a muscle injury as he went to challenge Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.The defender's tearful reaction clearly suggests it is a problem that threatens his World Cup chances.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63267141

Martinez managed to get both hands on Mitrovic's effort but was unable to keep it out.The visitors' misery was complete when Mings diverted Neeskens Kebano's low cross into his own net - a goal which was greeted by chants of ""Steven Gerrard, get out of our club"" by sections of the away end.Reaction to Aston Villa's defeat at FulhamGo straight to all the best Fulham contentVisit our Aston Villa pageFulham 3-0 Aston Villa: Steven Gerrard says 'I won't quit' before parting ways soon afterwardsVilla fans turn on GerrardHaving booed their players off the field following Sunday's home defeat by Chelsea, the Villa supporters once again made their feelings known as the visitors traipsed off the Craven Cottage pitch at half-time - and again in the latter stages of the contest. Unmistakable chants of ""You're getting sacked in the morning"" echoed around the ground following Mings' own goal, which capped a desperate performance from the away side in west London.Only the goal-line clearance from Mings and several impressive saves from Martinez kept the scoreline down in the first half.It could have been much worse for Villa, who afforded Marco Silva's team far too much space in the final third - particularly down Fulham's left - while offering precious little as an attacking threat.The decision to replace striker Danny Ings with Leander Dendoncker following Luiz's dismissal was met with derision from the away supporters, many of whom shouted ""we want Gerrard out"" in the direction of the Villa dugout.Former Liverpool and England captain Gerrard said before the game that his side were ""a lot closer to where we want to be"" in terms of performance levels - but Thursday's defeat was one too many for the Villa hierarchy.Fulham 3-0 Aston Villa: Cottagers boss Marco Silva 'pleased' with first-half dominanceFulham return to winning ways in styleSilva cut a frustrated figure after Fulham's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on Saturday, but his only qualm with the Cottagers' first-half display here will have been that it should have yielded more than Reed's well-taken opener.Former Chelsea and Arsenal winger Willian, who was reinstated to the Fulham side after making his comeback from injury against Bournemouth, was particularly lively in the opening stages as the hosts took the game to their opponents.The Brazilian had a fierce shot blocked by the foot of Martinez before fizzing a low ball across the penalty area which evaded everyone inside the box.The impressive Pereira then saw two spectacular long-range efforts deflected off target before Mitrovic was denied by Mings.The hosts added gloss to the scoreline through Mitrovic's penalty and Mings' late own goal, ending a run of three league games without victory in emphatic style.The win is Fulham's biggest in the Premier League in nine years - since a 4-1 victory at Crystal Palace during the 2013-14 campaign.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63238011

The final whistle brought more negative chants and American Marsch's position is starting to look shaky.Leicester's second win of the season was not enough to lift them out of the relegation zone, but it did move them to within a point of their 16th-placed opponents.And, while Brendan Rodgers' side have now picked up seven points from their last three home games, out-of-form Leeds are winless in seven and not picked up a point away from Elland Road since 13 August.The visitors, who struck the bar with an earlier Sinisterra effort, never looked like turning this around. Substitute Liam Cooper came closest to a reply with a low shot from an acute angle that was comfortably saved by Leicester keeper Danny Ward.Reaction as Leicester beat LeedsVisit our Leicester City pageGo straight to all the best Leeds United contentBarnes continues scoring run against LeedsLeicester 2-0 Leeds: Manager Brendan Rodgers 'pleased' with win over struggling LeedsBarnes' remarkable record against Leeds began in November 2020, in a 4-1 win at Elland Road that took Leicester to within a point of leaders Liverpool.Clearly, the Foxes' have dipped markedly since then and Rodgers' future has been the subject of intense debate.Barnes is one of the players Rodgers needs more from. The 24-year-old is evidently a player of immense talent. What he has not been able to do is reach his highest level on a consistent basis, which explains why he has not added to his solitary England cap, won against Wales, a month before that first goal against Leeds. His intelligence in not following the ball contributed to both Leicester's first-half goals.Koch knew Barnes was behind him and ready to pounce when he diverted Dennis Praet's cross past Illan Meslier after 16 minutes.Barnes was then on his own in a similar position when he drilled a shot through Meslier's legs after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall had provided the final pass of a flowing four-man move.It was the kind of goal that has Leicester fans scratching their heads and wondering how their club has ended up in their present predicament.Summerville can't spark Leeds as fans vent furyLeeds must be fighters - MarschDespite Leeds' troubles, Crysencio Summerville has had to be patient in waiting for his first Premier League start.The 20-year-old Dutchman was given the prized number 10 shirt by Marsch in the summer, yet it was only against Leicester that the Leeds boss felt confident enough to hand Summerville his first-team chance.It is true there are some raw edges that need to be smoothed and Diego Llorente gave him a real ear-bashing for failing to follow a runner as the Leeds defence scrambled to nullify one early Leicester attack.However, for the first hour he was one of the visiting players who looked most likely to threaten.Summerville might have done better than float a shot wide after one enterprising run into the box. Not long afterwards he  brought a good save out of Ward, although he was marginally offside.The Dutch Under-21 international has plenty of pace and is eager to get on the ball, but he should be getting helped out by more experienced colleagues as his Leeds team-mates simply failed to deliver.The chants following Sinisterra's departure were clearly directed at Marsch and the continuing discontent from the Leeds contingent after the final whistle suggested issues that go beyond a single loss, as disappointing as this was.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63238010
60,Bournemouth 0-1 Southampton: Che Adams winner relieves pressure on Ralph Hasenhuttl,WED 19 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Che Adams' first-half header was his third goal of the seasonSouthampton relieved the pressure on boss Ralph Hasenhuttl with their first win in six games against south-coast rivals Bournemouth, who lost for the first time under interim manager Gary O'Neil.It is hard to remember a time when pressure was not on Hasenhuttl, who has been in charge of the Saints since December 2018, but his side seem to grind out results when required and this was another example of that.Che Adams' first-half glancing header, after a left-wing cross from full-back Romain Perraud, was their first away goal in four games and ultimately proved enough as the Saints won for the first time since 30 August. Perhaps more importantly, and certainly more encouragingly for the remainder of the season, they kept their first clean sheet in 17 games, dating back to 16 April last season. They invited pressure from Bournemouth after the goal, but the hosts, who were unbeaten in six games under the guidance of O'Neil, failed to really test Republic of Ireland international Gavin Bazunu in the Saints' goal. Bournemouth 0-1 Southampton: Gary O'Neil proud of players despite defeatHasenhuttl told BBC Match of the Day: ""I am a proud man. I am proud for the boys for the effort they put in and this time we were absolutely ready for this win and the clean sheet. ""I think we deserved it today because we did a very good job.""All the things that we tried worked, from the set-up, to the gameplan, to the subs.

Going forward the Saints had energy with Adams and Adam Armstrong, but they often lacked quality, with Joe Aribo's toe-poked effort, saved by the outstretched feet of Neto, the closest they came to a second goal. Bournemouth 0-1 Southampton: Ralph Hasenhuttl 'a proud man' after Saints victoryThat chance was set up by the impressive Kyle Walker-Peters at right-back, but he went off injured in the second period, which will put a dampener on three important points. ""In the end it's a win for the whole group,"" Hasenhuttl added.""We know that we have to fight as a group together after an intense transfer window in the summer and there are some phases that you are going through as a club and a team.""We speak very often about the patience we need to have for them.""It's not always that you get the patience in this business, especially when you are a little bit long working in a club like I do.""O'Neil has done a remarkable job for Bournemouth since taking over the reins from Scott Parker, winning two games and drawing four, and you could see the confidence in his side as they tried to match their best unbeaten run in the top flight.But they too showed a lack of quality in the final third, with Billing's drive from 22 yards the only time they really called Bazunu into action. They nearly got their reward for their pressure in stoppage time when Bazunu dropped a corner and Lewis Cook turned towards goal but Mohammed Salisu was there to hack off the line for Southampton. This game will be one Bournemouth targeted points from, especially with tough games against West Ham and Tottenham next on the agenda, but a four-point gap to the bottom three at this stage represents a decent start on their return to the top flight.

The Paraguayan scored a fifth goal of the season with a lovely curling finish from 25 yards as the Magpies extended their unbeaten run to six games to remain sixth in the table. Howe's side took control of the first half through midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, who came close to scoring on two occasions, and then saw out victory against an Everton team which failed to register a shot on target despite a first start of the season by Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The England international returned from injury and headed over from a first-half corner, but it was Jordan Pickford who was the busier of the two England goalkeepers on show as Newcastle's Nick Pope was rarely troubled.  Follow all Wednesday's live Premier League action and reactionGet all our best Newcastle content in one placeVisit our dedicated Everton sectionAfter a promising start to the season, this was a third consecutive defeat for Frank Lampard's side, who have also lost against Tottenham and Manchester United. They sit a point above the bottom three, but will hope for a more encouraging result at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday and will be thankful Calvert-Lewin completed 73 minutes without further problems.But Almiron's fourth goal in as many games proved the difference, with Howe describing the strike as ""spectacular"". He said: ""Some of the goals he's scoring have been game changers for us, so I'm really pleased for him on a personal level because he's getting the recognition that he deserves for everything he gives the team, and long may that continue. ""You can't underestimate the quality of the goals that he's delivered for us. The one against Fulham was an incredible strike and this one, Bruno's weight of pass to him is very good so he was able to hit it first time, but still he had so much to do.""I think what I have noticed is a real confidence in his training and his technical delivery of what we're asking him to do. I think that's definitely going up a level.""Guimaraes and Almiron prove differenceEddie Howe says he is 'delighted' with Newcastle's attitude & characterWhen Newcastle beat Everton 3-1 in this fixture in February last season, it moved them out of the relegation zone. The fact this win temporarily pushed them up to fifth before Manchester United beat Tottenham, shows how far the club has developed since the takeover a year ago. Only three players from that starting line-up remained, with Guimaraes coming on in injury time. But on this occasion, he showed again why he has become a pivotal figure for new-look Newcastle. In the first half, he had time and space in midfield where it seemed as if there was none, and he helped create a couple of early chances. Around the half-hour mark he took control, and was instrumental in Newcastle going ahead by setting up Almiron for a delightful finish. He then almost doubled the lead on two occasions, one after a one-two with Kieran Trippier, and then with a low, curling shot - both efforts were just wide of the post. Almiron, who was the butt of a joke by Manchester City midfielder Jack Grealish last season, continued his good form and could have added to his tally with efforts either side of half-time. In a team which has lacked goals, he has proved a welcome stimulus. Although Newcastle will be disappointed they could not score further, they once again showed their defensive strength with a fifth clean sheet of the season. Everton lack goal threat despite Calvert-Lewin returnEverton should have had a penalty - LampardIn addition to Calvert-Lewin's return, Everton also welcomed back Anthony Gordon from suspension after five yellow cards. But they had a frustrating first half where Newcastle took charge of midfield and chances were at a premium. Calvert-Lewin was keen to make an impression, perhaps too keen, when he scythed down Guimaraes early on. Gordon, who Everton thought had been fouled in the penalty area, needlessly followed him into the book after a scuffle with Trippier. Everton have been careful to manage Calvert-Lewin's return after a ""freak"" knee injury before the season started, and his header aside - Everton's only effort towards goal - he was energetic if not on the same wavelength as his team-mates. The England striker tested Pope with a shot but was offside, and couldn't get on the end of two Demarai Gray cutbacks before he was withdrawn midway through the second half. Pickford was subjected to boos throughout the match because of his Sunderland heritage, but showed the maturity that Lampard spoke of on Tuesday by keeping his cool to deny Callum Wilson and Fabian Schar. Although there was a second-half improvement, Lampard, who is still building a new-look Everton side, will be disappointed with a lack of goal threat and the type of link-up play Newcastle showed in midfield. Afterwards, Lampard said that no shots on target was a ""slight red herring"" and was pleased that Calvert-Lewin ""got more minutes in his legs"". He added: ""I was disappointed that we didn't have more effect in the box. ""But it's not just on Dominic. He looked OK because he hasn't played for a long time. And he'll be better for the minutes in his legs. And, of course, he couldn't do 90 minutes tonight.

64,Man Utd 2-0 Tottenham: Bruno Fernandes & Fred goals see Red Devils beat Spurs,WED 19 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Fred scored the opening goal just after the break for Manchester UnitedManchester United produced their finest performance under manager Erik ten Hag as Tottenham were swept aside in the Premier League at Old Trafford.The scoreline does not do justice to United's vast superiority as only the brilliance of Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris denied them the truly emphatic victory they deserved.Lloris made five outstanding saves in the first half alone as United rained in 19 shots on the Spurs goal, which somehow remained intact.Fred finally broke the deadlock two minutes after the break, his shot carrying a degree of good fortune as Lloris was finally beaten by Ben Davies' deflection, but it was no more than United deserved for a display high on quality and intensity.United moved out of sight after 69 minutes when Bruno Fernandes curled a precise right-foot finish beyond the stretching Lloris in front of an ecstatic Stretford End.Victory keeps Manchester United fifth in the table, eight points behind leaders Arsenal, while Spurs miss the chance to move above Manchester City and stay third.Ten Hag to 'deal with' Ronaldo after early exit down tunnel against SpursFollow all Wednesday's live Premier League action and reactionGet all our best Man Utd content in one placeVisit our dedicated Spurs sectionTen Hag's imprint starts to showTen Hag happy with United performanceManchester United boss Ten Hag understandably looked a satisfied man as he marched off the Old Trafford pitch at the end of a triumph that bore all the hallmarks of what he wants from his new charges.United were sharper, faster and stronger than Spurs from the first whistle, the only concern being they might have been made to pay for not scoring in an opening 45 minutes which saw Lloris mount a one-man barrier of defiance, with outstanding saves from Luke Shaw and Marcus Rashford. The lively Antony also glanced the outside of the post with a 25-yard effort.The passing was swift and accurate, with Fred playing a key role alongside the steadying influence of Casemiro in midfield.And Fernandes showed some of the qualities that made him such a resounding success when he first joined United, the manner in which he steered his finish past Lloris for United's crucial second a sign of his restored confidence.If Ten Hag has a complaint, and there will not be many, it will be that a two-goal victory margin in no way reflects just how much better United were than a mediocre Spurs.When the season started, especially after defeats at home by Brighton and the 4-0 debacle at Brentford, a top-four place in the Premier League would have been a welcome target. If United maintain this target it is well within their compass.Negative Spurs fall short againMan Utd 2-0 Tottenham Hotspur: We struggle in games at high level - ConteThis was an opportunity for Tottenham to show just what a force they could become under manager Antonio Conte. Instead, they produced the sort of stodgy and negative performance that mirrored their demise in the north London derby defeat at Arsenal.Harry Kane had two shots blocked by David de Gea but there was a lack of inspiration and too much conservatism that meant Spurs got exactly what they deserved - nothing.Conte has built Tottenham as a counter-attacking side, but here they were so deep they presented United, as they did Arsenal, with the initiative and reduced the likes of Kane and Son Heung-min to bystanders for large parts of the game.Even some Spurs fans have questioned the somewhat restrictive, cagey, style Conte has implemented this season, and this was further evidence that a side boasting such attacking quality must surely offer more threat than this.De Gea made one of his crucial saves from Kane seconds before Fernandes sealed United's win. It was undoubtedly an important contribution, but Spurs showed such a lack of ambition that the reality states they only had the brilliant Lloris to thank for not slumping to a much heavier defeat.Spurs can surely do better than this.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63224228
65,Brighton & Hove Albion 0-0 Nottingham Forest: Hosts held to goalless draw by strugglers,TUE 18 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Brighton had 19 efforts on goal against Nottingham ForestBrighton's winless run under new boss Roberto de Zerbi continued with a frustrating Premier League draw against strugglers Nottingham Forest.The Italian is the first Brighton manager to fail to win any of his first four league games since Barry Lloyd in 1987.The results sees Brighton stay seventh after stuttering in recent weeks, picking up just two points from four games since the departure of Graham Potter to Chelsea.However, quite how the hosts did not manage to win will mystify and exasperate the new man at the helm. De Zerbi's side were dominant throughout and spurned several gilt-edged chances against a Forest side that appeared happy to try to contain their opponents. Leandro Trossard saw a powerful effort cannon back off the crossbar and was twice denied by good saves from Dean Henderson.Both Adam Webster and Joel Veltman missed glaring opportunities from close range and Henderson came to Forest's rescue again late on, his superb save from Pascal Gross ensuring that Steve Cooper's men climb off the bottom of the table.Familiar problems resurface for goal-shy BrightonFollow all Tuesday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion contentVisit our Nottingham Forest pageBrighton's old flaw returnsBrighton 0-0 Nottingham Forest: Roberto de Zerbi thanks side for creativityHaving seemingly solved their problems in front of goal earlier in the season, Brighton's last four fixtures have delivered a reminder of their major flaw over the last three campaigns in which they averaged just above a goal a game. Just as in their recent defeats against Tottenham and Brentford, their dominance of the ball did not translate into goals or points with 54 efforts on goal providing a return of just one point.  Forest's on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper Henderson can claim a considerable share of the credit for holding them at bay in this contest.He bravely scooped the ball away from Danny Welbeck's feet during the first period and athletically saved two stinging efforts from  Brighton's Belgian forward Trossard. However, tipping Gross' mis-hit effort to safety when it appeared destined to bounce into the top-left corner was arguably his best moment of the night.Forest fail to strike the right balanceBrighton 0-0 Nottingham Forest: Steve Cooper says draw a 'small step forward'Cooper will take some encouragement from seeing his side stem the flow of goals against them over the last three games.But there will also be an equal measure of concern as he reflects over a winless sequence of nine matches that stretches back to Forest's first home game of the season at the City Ground. Tactical tweaks to shore up a defence that shipped 18 goals in five matches have worked to a point but it is clear Forest are yet to strike the right balance, with their potency in attack suffering as a consequence. Forest are not yet detached from the clubs directly above them - but Cooper will know that too many more matches where they fail register a single effort on target could mean their return to the top flight is short-lived.

This is what it takes in the Premier League - we knew we had it within us and we got what we deserved.""Wolves, linked with former Ajax and Borussia Dortmund boss Peter Bosz as the latest name in their search for a successor to Bruno Lage, remain 17th, just one point above the relegation places.They came close to rescuing a point in London but Neves' late strike was superbly beaten away by Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita.Follow all Tuesday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace contentVisit our Wolves page'Sensational' Zaha shines for comeback kings Palace'Wolves win was important for Crystal Palace' - Patrick VieiraOnly four players have scored more Premier League goals in 2022 than Zaha's 14 - Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Ivan Toney and Erling Haaland.Wolves are only too aware of his talents - Zaha netted in both of Palace's 2-0 victories against them last season and followed that up with the winner here.In addition, the 29-year-old appears to be blossoming in the capacity of senior player, aiding the development of Palace's crop of talented youngsters including Eze, Olise, Marc Guehi and Tyrick Mitchell.""I have shifted from just a dribbler to goals.

He was back defending and working for his team.""When they defend well and these attacking players are let off the leash for Palace, it really is a joy to watch.""Entertaining affair surpasses humble expectations'We were excellent in large chunks' - Wolves interim boss Steve DavisGiven Palace had scored just four goals in their previous five games and Wolves had only managed that meagre tally all season, a thriller was not exactly expected but both sides served up a pleasant surprise.The tone was set after just four minutes as Cheick Doucoure rattled Wolves' post from 20 yards and Guaita had to react smartly to keep out Diego Costa at the other end soon after.Wolves then opened the scoring to end an away goal drought just five minutes shy of eight hours - 475 minutes to be precise - dating back to the opening day of the season.It was worth the wait as 20-year-old full-back Hugo Bueno, making his first Wanderers start, put in a teasing deep cross for Traore to bury a header inside Guaita's near post.Adama Traore's 31st-minute effort was the winger's first headed goal in English footballHowever, the game turned either side of the interval as Neves' 25-yard free-kick came back off the post just before the break and Eze headed Palace level right after the restart.If that was a cool finish, Zaha trumped it with the winner, sending Sa the wrong way after a clever touch from Edouard's low ball afforded him the freedom of the Wolves box.The Eagles are also making a habit of turnarounds, all three of their league wins this season - the others coming against Aston Villa and Leeds - have seen them fall behind first at home.For Wolves, meanwhile, an awful away run of 10 games without a win goes on, even if there were positives for caretaker managerial duo Steve Davis and James Collins to draw on.They will likely remain in charge for Sunday's important home game against fellow strugglers Leicester City, by which time Wolves could sit in the bottom three if other midweek results go against them.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63210236
67,Aston Villa 0-2 Chelsea: Mason Mount double extends Blues' winning run,SUN 16 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Mason Mount scored his first Chelsea goal of the season after Tyrone Mings' mistakeMason Mount scored his first two club goals of the season as Chelsea survived a first-half onslaught against Aston Villa to continue Graham Potter's unbeaten start as manager. The England international was gifted an opener when Tyrone Mings' header fell to him for an easy finish after six minutes. And in front of the watching England boss Gareth Southgate, Mount added a second from a 25-yard free-kick - but again he was helped after Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez was wrong-footed. Villa, who had been unbeaten in four games, did everything but score in the first half but found Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga in inspired form as he denied Danny Ings, John McGinn and Jacob Ramsey.  Potter, who is now six games unbeaten since taking over as Chelsea boss last month, and whose side have won the last five, gambled by playing forward Raheem Sterling at right wing-back following a knee injury to Reece James, which is set to keep the defender out of the World Cup. Potter said afterwards that James would be in a knee brace for four weeks.   But after seeing Villa dominate the first half without finding the net, Potter moved Sterling up front and enjoyed a more comfortable second half, which kept Chelsea in fourth, four points behind third-placed Tottenham with a game in hand.Villa might have been let down by two costly errors, and were booed at the final whistle, but manager Steven Gerrard would have been encouraged by his side's first-half display, if not their finishing. Gerrard 'won't hide' from Villa boos after defeatGet all the best Villa content hereFollow our dedicated Chelsea pageMount and Arrizabalaga earn hard-fought winPotter had already experimented with Sterling as a wing-back, opting for the England international on the left in his first game after joining the club last month, a draw against RB Salzburg.But against Villa it backfired as the hosts tore down the flanks, with Sterling leaving the right side of the defence exposed. After Mount was gifted his goal by Mings, Chelsea were left chasing the ball. Marc Cucurella struggled as Ings, Ollie Watkins and Leon Bailey caused problems right across the attack, helped by the fact that McGinn was doubling up on Villa's left side.The defence was indebted to Arrizabalaga, who made six first-half saves, including a brilliant stop to deny Ings' header from point-blank range. Five minutes before half-time, Potter admitted his tactical plan had failed by moving Ruben Loftus-Cheek into the right wing-back position instead of Sterling. Chelsea show support for Emma Hayes after 'trying week'And after Cesar Azpilicueta and Kalidou Koulibaly replaced Cucurella and Kai Havertz at the break, Chelsea looked a lot more solid. They could have gone further ahead when Sterling, restored to the attack, headed wide and had another effort saved by Martinez.Mount, who is in talks about a new Chelsea contract, killed the game off with a well-taken free-kick, but again he had a helping hand when Martinez shifted to his right.The Chelsea forward's strike went to the goalkeeper's left, but crossed the line close to the middle of the goal.Mistakes prove costly for VillaIn addition to the boos at the final whistle, Gerrard was also jeered as he made his way down the tunnel. But after the manager asked for recent ""frustration"" about his team's results to be channelled in the right way, the hosts answered with a first half that saw them also hit the woodwork twice. How they did not score was largely down to Arrizabalaga, who, in addition to a brilliant save from Ings, made an extraordinary double save to stop McGinn and then Ramsey after Bailey hit the bar with an earlier header. With Ings and Bailey in the starting line-up in place of Philippe Coutinho and Emiliano Buendia, there was plenty of joy down the flanks and the hosts were ably helped by Douglas Luiz in midfield. But Mings' error was inexplicable as he mistimed his header under no pressure as Ben Chilwell's flick looped up to him in the penalty area. Villa might argue that Chilwell was lucky to stay on the pitch after a robust tackle on Ramsey, for which he was only booked. In the second half, there were fewer chances as Chelsea tightened up and took control of possession. Arrizabalaga denied McGinn once more after 62 minutes, and within three minutes there was no coming back once Martinez misjudged Mount's free-kick. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63189779
68,Leeds 0-1 Arsenal: Bukayo Saka scores winning goal,SUN 16 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Bukayo Saka now has four goals and five assists this seasonPremier League leaders Arsenal held on to win at Leeds in a dramatic finish after the match had been delayed by about 40 minutes because of a power outage.There was drama in stoppage time when referee Chris Kavanagh sent off Arsenal's Gabriel for kicking out at Leeds striker Patrick Bamford and awarded the hosts a penalty, but both decisions were overturned after Kavanagh reviewed the incident on the pitchside monitor.Earlier, he halted the match after 23 seconds of play because of a power cut at Elland Road, which meant Kavanagh lost communication with the video assistant referee (VAR) officials, while goalline technology was down too.Once they got going again, the impressive Bukayo Saka scored the winning goal in the first half by punishing Rodrigo's loose pass, exchanging passes with Martin Odegaard before smashing in high at the near post.Bamford was sent on at the start of the second half and the Englishman almost made an immediate impact but his close-range strike was ruled out for a push on Gabriel.Before the stoppage-time controversy, Leeds were awarded a penalty when William Saliba was adjudged to have handled the ball, but Bamford dragged his effort wide.Leeds piled on the pressure and Luis Sinisterra's goal-bound shot was blocked by Gabriel, while Brenden Aaronson's arrowed strike from long range was pushed away by Aaron Ramsdale.Mikel Arteta's side are now four points clear after making a highly impressive start to the campaign which has seen them collect nine victories from 10 Premier League games.Luck, grit and 'something special' give Gunners winning formulaReaction to Sunday's Premier League gamesAll the Arsenal news in one placeFollow our dedicated Leeds pageBamford at centre of controversial contestJesse Marsch says visitors should not have even been in the gameArsenal's only blemish this season has been a defeat at Manchester United and the Gunners showcased their mettle by somehow holding on for victory.It wasn't without controversy though and they rode their luck in the second half.Bamford, who replaced Rodrigo, saw a couple of efforts saved by Ramsdale, as well as sending his penalty wide.In stoppage time, it looked as though he would get the opportunity of a reprieve when Kavanagh showed Gabriel a red card for kicking out at Bamford, but after consultation with VAR decided the striker had pushed the defender first.Leeds had plenty of chances with the lively Luis Sinisterra drilling wide and seeing a low shot tipped wide by Ramsdale. From the resulting corner, Pascal Struijk's poked effort was clawed out by the Arsenal goalkeeper.Ultimately, the home side could not find a breakthrough, increasing the pressure on boss Jesse Marsch as his side's winless run extended to six games.Arsenal continue to show promiseMikel Arteta says something special is happening with teamThe full-time whistle sparked wild celebrations from Arteta, with his side recording Arsenal's best league record after 10 games since the 1904-05 season.Playing from the right-hand side, England midfielder Saka tormented Leeds' Struijk for much of the game and the only goal came via that channel.Rodrigo inexplicably tried to pick out his team-mate with a cross-field pass which was pounced on by Saka, before a quick interchange allowed him to thump home his fifth goal of the season.Gabriel Jesus chipped over from inside the six-yard box, while skipper Odegaard's free-kick was pushed away by the sprawling Illan Meslier.Though Leeds threatened until the end, Arsenal managed to claim their fourth clean sheet away from home in a campaign which is full of promise.Power cut causes long delayReferee Chris Kavanagh was unable to communicate with the video assistant refereeThe earlier delay because of a power outage outside Elland Road meant referee Kavanagh could not communicate with VAR, which would play a crucial role when the match eventually resumed. Kavanagh had to watch replays of both Saliba's handball and the incident between Gabriel and Bamford at the end on the pitchside monitor before making his final decisions.When the match was halted within the first minute, the players were left standing around and fans did not know what was happening. An announcement was eventually made inside the stadium to say there had been a ""power cut"", before Kavanagh led the two sets of players off the pitch after a wait of 12 minutes.The players and officials returned to the pitch about 20 minutes later for a warm-up, before the 14:00 BST kick-off resumed at 14:40.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63189783

Substitute Rashford climbed highest but his effort went wide of the far post.A goal at that point would have been harsh on Newcastle, who came close to securing only their second victory at Old Trafford since 1972 but after Joelinton's first-half header had hit the bar, the Brazilian failed to head the rebound into an empty net.The hosts' frustrations were summed up by Cristiano Ronaldo.The Portuguese striker, who had two second-half efforts disallowed, shook his head in irritation when he was replaced by Rashford 18 minutes from time.He carried on chuntering to himself and shaking his head until he reached the dug-out, when he slumped down in simmering discontent.Ten Hag calls on players to 'kill' opponents after Newcastle drawErik Ten Hag 'Disapointed' with Newcastle result but 'pleased' with Man Utd's performanceUnited miss EriksenSir Alex Ferguson presented David de Gea and Ronaldo with personal awards before kick-off.

The second was more debatable. Ronaldo and his team-mates argued Fabian Schar had rolled a free-kick back to Pope and therefore the ball was in play. Pope did not move as Ronaldo closed in, suggesting he thought the kick was still to be taken. Referee Craig Pawson sided with the England keeper, so Ronaldo nipping in to get the ball and tap into an empty net only brought him a yellow card.Evidently Ten Hag was not impressed with Pawson's performances judging by the way the Dutchman marched towards the official at the final whistle.Howe felt Newcastle 'unsettled' Man Utd but 'pleased to hear final whistle'Impressive NewcastleIt was another good result for Newcastle, who have now drawn with both Manchester clubs and have still only lost once this season.Joelinton should have put them in front. De Gea was on the floor having tried to save the Brazilian's initial header from Kieran Trippier's cross, so all the Brazilian had to do was get his effort on target.Sadly for the visitors, he did not manage it, just as Miguel Almiron rushed his second-half shot from a pre-planned corner routine and blazed it into the Stretford End when he had time to do much better.Nevertheless, on a ground where they hardly win and have not even secured a point since 2015, this was one of Newcastle's better efforts.Trippier in particular looked good, which is positive for Gareth Southgate given his recent bad news on the injury front for so many of his right-backs.Certainly if anyone is going to gate-crash the established top six this season, Newcastle look like being the ones to do it.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63189781

Palace were looking to frustrate first and do their damage on the counter-attack through Wilfried Zaha's pace; they weren't overly successful, but it pointed to deeper issues for Leicester.Nervous energy filled the stadium and, given the Foxes had lost seven of their previous nine league games, that was understandable.But it meant Leicester only attacked in spurts, with flashes from Barnes, Daka and Maddison, but never really enough to build momentum and win the game. Wout Faes, their only major summer signing, was their standout player at the back.This was another long afternoon in what is becoming a long season for Rodgers' side, summed up by the talismanic Maddison picking up a booking for simulation that will keep him out of Thursday's match with Leeds.Zaha on the periphery for PalacePatrick Vieira says his Palace side were 'flat' in goalless draw with LeicesterBeing substituted inside the last 15 minutes with the game still on a knife-edge epitomised Zaha's day.There were moments for the visitors, with Eze particularly busy in midfield, but they couldn't find the killer pass to make the difference.

73,Fulham 2-2 Bournemouth: Cherries stay unbeaten under Gary O'Neil,SAT 15 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Aleksandar Mitrovic's goal from the penalty spot was his fifth at Craven Cottage so far this seasonBournemouth remain unbeaten under interim manager Gary O'Neil following an entertaining 2-2 draw with Fulham.The Cherries led through Dominic Solanke after just over a minute, but Issa Diop levelled for the hosts.Jefferson Lerma restored the lead before half-time, but Aleksandar Mitrovic's penalty early in the second half drew Fulham level again.O'Neil has now overseen four draws and two victories since the sacking of Scott Parker in August.Fulham battled well to come from behind twice and earn a point following consecutive defeats by Newcastle and West Ham.The result leaves Bournemouth in ninth place in the Premier League, while Fulham are one place and a point below.

74,Wolves 1-0 Nottingham Forest: Ruben Neves scores penalty and Brennan Johnson misses penalty,SAT 15 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Wolves have converted their past 18 penalties in the Premier League, including seven from Ruben NevesWolves' match-winner Ruben Neves alerted his team-mates to the pre-match social media wind-up that backfired badly on Nottingham Forest at Molineux.In the build-up to their 1-0 defeat, Forest's official Twitter account posted a mock-up picture of striker Emmanuel Dennis sat on the pitch at the City Ground with three wolf cubs calmly sat with him, with the caption 'Playtime'.The post was subsequently deleted, but not before Neves had forwarded it to the Wolves squad.Neves went on to score the only goal from the penalty spot to lift Wolves out of the relegation zone and leave Forest bottom of the Premier League.Wolves then posted 'Playtime's over', together with a picture of an axe embedded in a tree trunk.""Yes, we were aware of it,"" said Wolves interim manager Steve Davis. ""We were going to use it in the talk but Ruben said he put it on the players' chat so I didn't need to say any more.""Those sort of things used to happen on the pitch.

""He has played through it. A lot of players can play through pain. Some can't. Fair play to Jose to show courage at that moment.""Asked if it was dangerous, Davis added: ""It depends where the break is. If his wrist is hanging off he is not going to play. It is the severity of the damage. The player has an X-ray and together with the coach decides whether the risk is worth it.""Victory was a superb way for Davis and fellow boss James Collins to start a crucial week that ends with a home clash with Leicester next Sunday.However, for Steve Cooper, the pain goes on. His side are without a win since August and have picked up a single point from their last seven games.Day to remember for stand-in boss DavisSteve Davis 'delighted' with Wolves win over struggling ForestFor lifelong Wolves fan Davis, presiding over this victory will be particularly satisfying.Chairman Jeff Shi's search for a permanent replacement for Bruno Lage continues and Wolves' biggest problem - a lack of goal threat - remains.But Neves' goal - only Wolves' fourth in the league this season and their first in the second half of a game for 11 matches - gave them their second win in 17 matches and will lift spirits around a club seemingly in freefall.No-one encapsulates Wolves' slide down the Premier League more than Adama Traore.During two seventh-placed finishes under Nuno Espirito Santo, the Spain winger was a genuine threat.While inconsistency has always been an irritating feature of his game, at his best Traore is capable of unhinging defences with his pace alone.But with only three league goals since 2019, his contract running out at the end of the season and a hoped-for move to Barcelona failing to materialise, Traore's time at Molineux appears to be drifting to a mediocre end.He at least looked capable of creating chances here, crossing for Kilman to head against a post and Rayan Ait-Nouri to nod wide at the far post.It was Traore's shot which struck Harry Toffolo and eventually brought Wolves their penalty after Bramall was sent to the screen by VAR Lee Mason.Cooper's penalty painSteve Cooper 'disappointed' with Forest who 'didn't show enough bravery'Forest handed Cooper a new three-year contract after their four-goal hammering at Leicester a fortnight ago. Without it, his tenure would be extremely precarious now.He was visibly frustrated at Wolves' penalty, particularly as the game had moved to the other end of the pitch and the hosts were preparing to take a corner when Mason alerted Bramall to Nunes' infringement.Cooper could only watch in despair as Johnson wasted the opportunity to level.It came a few hours after Wolves ill-advised tweet and evidently someone senior at the City Ground did not like it as the post was deleted.At the moment, despite a summer outlay in excess of £100m, Forest are the ones who look like a becalmed version of what they are supposed to be.Follow live updates and reaction for today's Premier League action Visit our Wolves pageGo straight to all the best Nottingham Forest content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63182451

""He felt a problem in his calf. He will have an MRI tomorrow.""Tottenham 2-0 Everton: Antonio Conte hopes fans will enjoy win over ToffeesToothless Toffees pay price for first-half missesBefore the game, manager Lampard spoke of Everton's improved strength of character since their narrow escape from relegation last season.The Merseyside club have undoubtedly come a long way since losing 5-0 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March but the visitors were taking no risks in the early stages here, with midfield trio Iwobi, Onana and Idrissa Gueye operating deep in front of the Toffees' back five in an effort to stifle Conte's side.But Everton soon grew into the contest and should have taken the lead when Coady released Gray, but the winger's finish lacked composure.The same applied to Onana's wild effort not long afterwards, which came after the Everton midfielder had capitalised on a lapse in concentration from Hojbjerg inside the Tottenham half.It was one-way traffic in the second-half, however, as the Toffees failed to register a shot at Hugo Lloris' goal.Their overall tally of four attempts is their lowest total in a Premier League game this season.Tottenham 2-0 Everton: Frank Lampard says side must take chances",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63182450
76,Brentford 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Ivan Toney underlines England credentials with two goals,FRI 14 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Ivan Toney scored his 50th and 51st league goals for Brentford against BrightonIvan Toney underlined his England credentials with two goals as Brentford returned to winning ways against Brighton in the Premier League. While Brighton have enjoyed several excellent results on their travels this season, they struggled for fluidity and incisiveness against high-energy opponents led superbly by Toney on his 100th appearance for the Bees.The hosts had already seen Bryan Mbeumo's improvised volley cannon off the visitors' crossbar by the time Toney opened the scoring with a wonderful backheeled flick from Frank Onyeka's pass from the right. With Brighton searching for an equaliser after the break, Toney then doubled their advantage, going down under Joel Veltman's crude challenge from behind and getting up to convert his eighth successive top-flight penalty.The result sees Thomas Frank's side move up to eighth in the table, a place and a point behind the Seagulls, who are yet to win under new manager Roberto de Zerbi.Toney was called into the England squad for September's Nations League fixtures against Italy and Germany but was not used by Gareth Southgate.However, on current form he is making a compelling case for a place on the plane to Qatar for the upcoming World Cup with only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (15) having now scored more Premier League goals than the Bees centre-forward, who has eight.

Both De Zerbi and Frank were booked for an altercation in the technical area and on the pitch Brentford mirrored their manager's aggression.Toney, Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa set the tone early on, pressuring the Brighton defence and goalkeeper Robert Sanchez into several mistakes when attempting to play out from the back.  At that stage the opening was also notable for the constant and warm vocal tribute paid by Brighton's travelling fans to midfielder Enock Mwepu, who was forced to retire aged 24 this week because of a hereditary heart condition.Brentford 2-0 Brighton: Albion 'wanted to win for Mwepu' - Roberto de ZerbiWhile Brighton had chances to go in front from a tame Danny Welbeck header and most notably Veltman's close-range shot from a corner, there was also an absence of the spark that saw them score three at Anfield earlier this month.  To underline the point, the Seagulls had more than 70% possession and had registered 21 shots by the full-time whistle, but aside from Adam Lallana's late header, rarely looked like making the breakthrough. ""To win a game you have to score,"" said De Zerbi. ""We don't find the goals. We lose too many second balls, too many duels. We made mistakes about shooting, about the last pass, about crosses. But this is the right way for us. ""We have to do more. We have to improve, to learn, to understand.""Brentford and Toney made the most of their opportunities, scoring twice from just three efforts on target. Mads Roerslev could have added further gloss to a fine victory but he saw his effort cleared off the line after Sanchez had been unable to claim a cross.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63167991

The result ends a sequence of five consecutive defeats for Steve Cooper's side, who move up to 19th in the table, a point above Leicester and four behind Villa who remain 16th. Roared on by a vociferous City Ground crowd, Emmanuel Dennis gave the hosts the perfect start, capitalising on some poor marking to head in Morgan Gibbs-White's free-kick after drifting across the front of a static Villa defence. However, Ashley Young levelled seven minutes later with a superb effort from 25 yards that flew into the bottom left corner. It was Young's first goal for Villa since 2011 - when he was in his first spell at the club - and it was the only notable moment of attacking inspiration from two sides that otherwise struggled creatively in the final third.Steven Gerrard's team had an Ollie Watkins effort correctly ruled out for offside and appeals for a penalty waved away when Forest captain Ryan Yates appeared to catch Ezri Konsa, too often their final ball or shot lacked the precision to trouble home goalkeeper Dean Henderson.

With Filippo Giraldi having recently been installed as sporting director to put the structures in place to help Forest compete in the top flight again, Cooper's first job was to end a dismal run that had seen them concede 18 goals in 450 minutes of football.Having made five changes to his starting XI from the 4-0 humbling at fellow strugglers Leicester, he was rewarded with a performance that offered more solidity and was brimming with application.

John McGinn, Philippe Coutinho and Emiliano Buendia were all included in Gerrard's starting XI but none were able to deliver a telling moment for their side. A well-worked early corner routine that saw McGinn scuff his shot into a posse of a defenders was in keeping with what was to follow for the visitors. Villa enjoyed plenty of possession but lacked potency once they approached the Forest penalty area, with just two of their 12 efforts on goal on target.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63112866

That allowed us to go through those difficult periods. But now we have to build from that.""Set-piece woes for Leeds againLeeds taking a step in right direction - Jesse MarschAfter avoiding relegation on the final day of last term, Leeds are hoping for a less stressful time in what is boss Jesse Marsch's first full season in charge.The West Yorkshire side made an excellent start to the campaign with wins against Wolves and Chelsea in their first three games, but they are now without a win since late August.They began this match in dominant form as Palace struggled to deal with them, with Aaronson looking lively and Bamford sharp on his return to the starting XI.But set pieces have been a point of concern, and once again they were Leeds' undoing as they failed to pick up Edouard for Olise's free-kick.Since the start of last season, they have conceded 20 goals from set pieces, with only Southampton (21), Everton (23) and Leicester (25) letting in more. After conceding the equaliser, Leeds rarely looked like scoring again as their struggles on the road continued, and they have now taken just one point in four away games so far this season.""Most of the teams I've coached, we score goals in bunches, and here we just aren't able to reward ourselves in big moments when we create advantages and are often on top of the game,"" said Marsch.""In every game it's been a little like that. We've got to find a way to get leads and then add onto them.""We like our group a lot. I like this team. I love this team, I really do.

79,West Ham 3-1 Fulham: Gianluca Scamacca continues scoring streak to settle London derby,SUN 09 Oct 2022,premier-league,"West Ham going in right direction - MoyesGianluca Scamacca scored for a third successive game as West Ham came from behind to beat Fulham.Fulham led after six minutes as Andreas Pereira fired in from a tight angle.But Pereira then fouled Craig Dawson from a corner, Jarrod Bowen scoring the penalty.Scamacca missed a series of good chances but netted when it counted as he lobbed Bernd Leno, before a defensive mix-up presented Michail Antonio with the third.Scamacca shows signs of ending West Ham striker curseFulham took the lead with the first major attack of the game - Kurt Zouma failed to close down Pereira on the left side of the West Ham box, and the Brazilian beat Łukasz Fabianski for power with his shot high into the net from a tight angle.In an entertaining first half full of chances, Daniel James cracked the crossbar from 20 yards with a dipping left foot shot, before Scamacca missed a trio of opportunities to draw West Ham level.The Hammers equalised instead from the penalty spot, with Pereira going from hero to villain as he barged Dawson to the floor from a corner. Bowen slotted the spot kick to Bernd Leno's right.Scamacca missed another headed chance from six yards, however he finally found the net in superb fashion by chipping Leno, with the goal given after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) check.He was replaced by Antonio with 10 minutes to go, and the sub finished the game in comical fashion - after his initial shot was saved by Leno, the German keeper and Tim Ream got in each other's way trying to clear, inadvertently presenting the striker with an open goal to finish.Scattergun Scamacca finds the targetHaving had to bide his time following his £32m move from Sassuolo in the summer, Scamacca now has six goals in 12 games for West Ham. After netting against Wolves last weekend and the winner against Anderlecht on Thursday, the Italian was the Hammers' main man once again.He could - perhaps should - have scored several more. On 16 minutes he headed down a driven Paqueta cross from eight yards while unmarked which, while Leno brilliantly scooped it out from near his boot, he should have guided further away from the keeper.Before the 25th minute Scamacca had missed two more chances, dragging a one on one narrowly wide of the far post before sending another header straight at Leno.Five minutes after the break he missed another free header, this time from only six yards - yet when the toughest chance came, after being put through by Paqueta with a lovely chipped through ball, he kept his nerve to scoop it over the goalie.Scamacca did not immediately celebrate and was subjected to a VAR check of several minutes, which looked at whether he was offside or had handled the ball. With no clear evidence to disallow for either reason, the goal was given - and the Italian finally celebrated wildly with fans.It encapsulated Scamacca's Premier League career so far - a slow start peppered with what-ifs, finally coming good. He is the first West Ham striker to score in his opening two home starts at London Stadium - fans will hope the club's recent poor run of forward signings is at an end.For West Ham it continues their dominance over Fulham - they have won their last five Premier League games against the Cottagers, while David Moyes has now won 14 of his 15 games against them.It also means they have won consecutive league matches for the first time since January, further raising hopes a difficult start is behind them.West Ham 3-1 Fulham: Marco Silva refuses to criticise referee in lossMitrovic missed as Fulham frustratedIt was a frustrating afternoon for Marco Silva, who was booked for his remonstrations with the officials after the Scamacca goal was given. Fulham started well but faded after West Ham equalised.Things could have been very different - Pereira was busy in the opening stages and took his goal brilliantly, his first Premier League strike in two years and 333 days since scoring for Manchester United against Brighton in November 2019.And had James' 20-yard dipper on 13 minutes been a few inches lower, the story of the game would surely have been different.Instead this game shows how much Fulham miss Aleksandar Mitrovic when the Serbian bruiser is unavailable. He was absent for this game after aggravating a foot injury last week against Newcastle, and replacement Carlos Vinicius was unremarkable.Silva also has problems to solve at the other end of the pitch. Fulham have kept just one clean sheet in the past 22 top-flight away meetings, conceding 52 goals.Comedy mix-ups such as the one between Leno and Ream for West Ham's third aside, Fulham were picked apart regularly and had Scamacca had his sights aligned all game, they could have conceded several more.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63106178

Under the circumstances, handing him his first league start was a fairly straightforward decision for Ten Hag.Yet, even at 30, with so many honours to his name, Casemiro evidently still has some learning to do. In Spain, he might have got a free-kick when he was barged off the ball by Onana, leading to Everton's opener. Tonight, referee David Coote waved the game on.Casemiro didn't let the setback affect him. He should have scored when he ran unmarked on to Rashford's cross, slapping the turf in frustration as his header bounced wide. But he made amends with the through ball that sent Ronaldo running towards the Everton goal for his landmark effort.Casemiro continued to contribute in an unfussy way, taking the ball in tight spaces and laying off close-range passes.However, he was hustled out of possession more often than Ten Hag would have liked and by the end, the United boss had introduced Scott McTominay and Raphael Varane for additional defensive solidity to see the game out.You can now get Man Utd news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out morePodcast: The Devils' Advocate - listen to the latest episode on BBC SoundsEverton 1-2 Man Utd: We were punished for first half - LampardEverton fail to capitalise on perfect startIt was a disappointing evening for the hosts, who had the chance to win three games in a row for the first time since Carlo Ancelotti's spell at the club, in addition to jumping above both United and Merseyside rivals Liverpool.They couldn't have had a better start either. Iwobi's goal was a wonderful curling effort from 25 yards and owed much to the tenacity of Onana.But Frank Lampard's side were starved of possession for long periods and when they did get the ball, far too many misplaced passes cost them momentum.A Demarai Gray free-kick in a promising position that floated all the way over the penalty area and out for a goal-kick summed up their evening, and Anthony Gordon's booking for a tackle from behind on Bruno Fernandes means he will be suspended for Saturday's trip to Tottenham.Dominic Calvert-Lewin's return should at least provide another attacking focal point, although after his second long absence in 12 months he will need to be carefully managed.You can now get Everton news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out more",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63106173

""This is with a team that the previous manager was telling us were not fit for purpose after losing heavily to Liverpool.""Former England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis added: ""O'Neil has proved his worth and a change now would be detrimental to Bournemouth.""In the first half they lacked a cutting edge and were well marshalled by Leicester, trailing to Daka's strike and with only Ryan Fredericks' claims for a penalty to get excited about.After the break though they were a different proposition, pushing the Foxes back and deservedly equalising, even if Billing's fine finish was preceded by bad errors from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Wout Faes for Leicester.Sensing blood against the Premier League's worst defence, Bournemouth attacked again and Billing was given time to pick out Solanke whose neat header was tucked away by Christie.It nearly got even better, only for Jaidon Anthony's late strike on the counter-attack to be ruled out for an offside in the build-up.A new era beckons under Foley - on this evidence, O'Neil should be part of it.Bournemouth 2-1 Leicester: Brendan Rodgers says side got too comfortableAs for Leicester, that victory over Forest had seemed to mark a turning point, but the old failings that brought six defeats in a row were in evidence once again.Faes and centre-back partner Jonny Evans looked dominant in the first half, but Faes' loose touch let Solanke in to set up Bournemouth's leveller and then they were too passive for the winner.It has been a horrible start to the season for Rodgers' side and the next two fixtures at home to Crystal Palace and Leeds may prove crucial in deciding his future.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63099424
83,Chelsea 3-0 Wolves: Armando Broja scores in dominant Blues victory,SAT 08 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Chelsea have had a strong week - PotterArmando Broja scored his first Chelsea goal in a dominant victory over a lacklustre Wolves, who remain without a permanent manager.Kai Havertz opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time but the Blues could have put the game out of sight long before then.Christian Pulisic doubled the lead, playing a one-two with Mason Mount and sending the ball sailing past goalkeeper Jose Sa before Broja hammered into the bottom corner with his left foot late on.The game marked Graham Potter's first home Premier League victory as Chelsea boss.He made wholesale changes to the line-up from the 2-1 win over Crystal Palace last weekend, swapping seven players and showcasing the depth in the squad, with Conor Gallagher earning a start after scoring the winner last time out and Reece James and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on the bench.Wolves, playing their first match since sacking manager Bruno Lage last weekend, were unorganised and Diego Costa, making his first start for the Midlands club against his former side, struggled to get in the game with the team hemmed in their own half.'Excited' Potter starting to put stamp on ChelseaGo to all the best Chelsea contentVisit our Wolves pageThe 1-0 scoreline at half-time flattered Wolves as Cesar Azpilicueta, playing in his first Premier League game since August, put several teasing deliveries into the box which no one could latch on to, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Pulisic both hammered over the bar.Gallagher looked lively from the outset, while Mount was dynamic - it was his lofty delivery from the right-hand side that picked out Havertz for the opener, with the Germany international's header looping over Sa.But Broja, who impressed on loan at Southampton last season, will have been pleased to get off the mark with his first goal for the club when he replaced Mount after the break.Without midfielder Ruben Neves, who is suspended having picked up five yellow cards this season, Wolves looked uncomfortable at the back, giving the ball away carelessly deep in their own half and making hard work for themselves in dangerous areas.Wolves have been linked with former Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui, with interim boss Steve Davis saying earlier in the week he had been told he was in charge of the match against Chelsea but was unsure of the situation beyond that.They remain stuck in the relegation zone having lost their last three matches, while Chelsea move to fourth.Costa rusty as Chelsea punish WolvesWolves will need to 'manage' Costa's minutes - DavisAs Potter continues to grow into his role and implement his style at Chelsea, his abundance of attacking options was evident against Wolves with the front line looking strong even with Aubameyang confined to the bench.But Wolves' attacking problems continue to prevail with the side having scored a meagre three goals this campaign, the lowest of any side in the league.The side continued to lack goal threat with recent free-transfer signing Costa, Hwang Hee-chan and Goncalo Guedes - who is without a goal in nine games since a £27.5m summer move from Valencia - their only fit senior strikers.Costa was substituted for the returning Hee-chan, who was sidelined last week with a groin problem, and took the applause of the entirety of Stamford Bridge, even shaking Chelsea fans' hands as he made his way round the pitch to the bench.During his time with Chelsea, the 34-year-old scored 52 goals in 89 top-flight games between 2014 and 2017, and helped the side to two Premier League wins.But he showed he is not to be relied on by Wolves just yet as he failed to make a notable impact, understandable having not played since December 2021 until last weekend's defeat by West Ham, where he came on as a substitute.Wolves improved early in the second half with Daniel Podence going close, but without experienced forward Raul Jimenez and long-term absentee Sasa Kalajdzic there was a lack of follow through. And Chelsea's second goal dispirited them.Wolves have won just one of their past 16 Premier League games, failing to score in six of their past nine matches.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63099428
84,Man City 4-0 Southampton: Erling Haaland scores again as defending champions move top,SAT 08 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Erling Haaland is an 'incredible weapon' for Manchester City - Pep GuardiolaManchester City manager Pep Guardiola says Erling Haaland is helping to bring the best out of Kevin de Bruyne after seeing the pair help his side sweep Southampton aside to move top of the Premier League.Haaland scored his 20th goal for City against Saints, while De Bruyne's pass to set up Phil Foden means his stats are just as stellar, with nine assists in his first nine league games.De Bruyne has already bettered the tally of eight league assists he made last season, and is well on his way towards breaking the record of 20 in a single campaign that he shares with Thierry Henry.""Of course for a player like Kevin, and especially Kevin, having this threat, this guy [Haaland] who likes to run in behind with this pace, it helps him a lot,"" Guardiola said.""Kevin again created three or four chances [against Southampton], but he can play better. Today was not the best Kevin that we know, because he can put his mate in front of the keeper most of the time - but having players like Erling, Julian [Alvarez] or Phil, making movements in behind, it is so important to him.""Haaland called 'ridiculous' and 'sublime' as he sets more scoring recordsRelive all Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Manchester City contentVisit our Southampton pageTwenty goals is usually the benchmark of a successful season for any striker, but Haaland has taken only 13 games to reach that mark in all competitions, with struggling Saints the latest side to find out how hard it is to keep him or his team-mates quiet. City attacked relentlessly from the start and Haaland was within inches of giving them an early lead when - to the surprise of virtually the entire stadium - he hit the inside of the post after galloping clear.Instead it was Joao Cancelo who put the home side ahead, running on to Phil Foden's pass and cutting past James Ward-Prowse before finding the bottom corner of the net.Foden, who like Haaland scored a hat-trick here against Manchester United last weekend, got on the scoresheet himself soon afterwards with a dinked finish after De Bruyne found him in space in the box.That put City in complete control at the break and they wrapped up the points at the start of the second half when Riyad Mahrez volleyed home a Rodri cross.The only thing missing for the home fans was another Haaland goal and, after three successive home league hat-tricks, for once it appeared it might not be his day. Haaland was unable to get on the end of De Bruyne's cross under pressure from Mohammed Salisu, and then brilliantly denied by Gavin Bazunu who dived at his feet as he charged through on goal.As the chances kept coming however, you just knew Haaland would take one - and so he did, meeting Cancelo's cutback with a typically precise low finish to make it 4-0 after 65 minutes.Southampton, who managed only one touch in the City area and a total of two shots - both from distance, and both off target - drew home and away against Guardiola's side last season. This time, they never looked like avoiding a fourth consecutive defeat. City keep scoring, and keep on winningCity were last in top spot on 20 August and might not stay there for long - Arsenal will return to the summit if they beat Liverpool on Sunday.Regardless of their current position in the table, though, it is clear the defending champions are in the sort of form which will worry all their title rivals.City are the last unbeaten side in England's top four divisions, but it is the way they are dispatching opponents that is ominous.City's stroll against Saints means they have now scored 33 goals in nine league games, 13 more than Arsenal who have the next best tally.Having Haaland obviously helps - he now has 15 Premier League goals for the season, matching the tally of De Bruyne when he finished as top scorer in the competition in 2021-22 - but his team-mates keep scoring too.Saints put up a fight for their managerManchester City 4-0 Southampton: 'The gap is too big' - Ralph Hasenhuttl on Manchester CitySouthampton's performance was far more important to their manager's cause than the end result.Reports this week suggested Ralph Hasenhuttl is on the brink of the sack after four years at St Mary's, but his side did not play like one that has given up on him.True, damage limitation was always their main aim, but that has not saved others from worse drubbings at Etihad Stadium this season.Hasenhuttl must have feared the worst when City came flying out of the blocks but his side defended well, and continued to do so even when the game was long lost.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63099425
85,Newcastle United 5-1 Brentford: Bruno Guimaraes scores twice in thumping win,SAT 08 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Eddie Howe praised ""outstanding"" Bruno Guimaraes as Newcastle marked a year since their takeover with a crushing win over Brentford.Guimaraes put Newcastle ahead with a flying header before Jacob Murphy doubled the advantage shortly after following an error from David Raya.Ivan Toney scored against his old club via a penalty, but Guimaraes netted again less than two minutes after.Miguel Almiron and an Ethan Pinnock own goal completed the scoring.Brentford were first to have the ball in the back of the net, Bryan Mbeumo running on to a Shandon Baptiste flick and slamming through Nick Pope's legs. However Toney was ruled to be interfering with play as he moved out the way of the ball while offside, and the effort was ruled out by VAR. Instead Newcastle took the lead, Kieran Trippier brilliantly curling in a far-post cross from deep after a short corner with Guimaraes heading home.Newcastle boss Howe, speaking to Match of the Day, said of Guimaraes: ""He was outstanding. We really missed him when he was out [as he is] a quality player who helps us in every phase.""United doubled their lead thanks to a howler from Raya, who passed straight to Callum Wilson. He played square for Murphy to strike past covering defender Ben Mee.Toney made it 2-1 from the spot after Aaron Hickey headed against Dan Burn's raised arm, but one minute and 57 seconds later Guimaraes restored the two-goal advantage as he won the ball from Hickey near the halfway line, drove forward and struck to Raya's right from 25 yards.Brentford were their own worst enemies as they were caught playing out from the back again, Pinnock selling Raya short with an under-hit pass that Almiron burst on to and slammed home. Pinnock was again at fault for number five, sticking a boot out right in front of Raya to deflect a low cross from the left past his own goalkeeper.Let's talk about Bruno - Newcastle's £38m 'bargain'Five-star Toon on day of celebrationNewcastle 5-1 Brentford: Bruno Guimaraes was outstanding says Eddie HoweOne year and a day since a Saudi-led consortium took over their club, Newcastle's fans were in celebratory mood at St James' Park. A tifo covered the Gallowgate End before kick-off, based on the takeover announcement and listing the signings made in the past 12 months.Two of the players signed by the current owners are Trippier and Guimaraes, and both were in stellar form here.  Trippier's crossing was a constant menace, as he left a timely reminder as to why he may go to the World Cup with England ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold.Guimaraes was the driving force from midfield for Eddie Howe's side, his goals ending a run of three successive home draws for the Tynesiders.Almiron was also excellent - signed during the Mike Ashley era and often maligned, he was an endlessly energetic attacking presence, forcing a great save from Raya after five minutes and carrying on in that form.He only got one goal last season but is already on four this campaign, and after scoring was presented with a Paraguay flag from the crowd - a sign of the esteem in which he is held by fans.Of Almiron, Howe said: ""It is all about building consistency to his game but he has performed brilliantly off the ball and now he is adding goals to that.""The return of Allan Saint-Maximin as a late substitute capped a terrific day for Newcastle, the forward having not played since August because of a hamstring injury.Unhappy return for ToneyNewcastle 5-1 Brentford: Thomas Frank says team are 'fuming' after lossBrentford last won at Newcastle 88 years ago, and aside from a VAR-crushed moment early on never looked likely to end that sequence here.The goalless draw at Bournemouth last weekend marked their first clean sheet in 20 Premier League away fixtures. With five shipped here, clearly Thomas Frank has issues to solve in defence.Frank told Match of the Day: ""In general I never thought we would concede five goals, we did today. In life and football it is about how you respond to setbacks.""If you want to win football matches it is relatively important you don't make one, two, three, or four mistakes leading to goals. To make four mistakes then you lose football games and basically that is it.""We are of course fuming. I can feel my anger bursting around inside me. It is the same as the players and we will bounce back.""It was also a bad day for Toney, captaining Brentford at the stadium where he made two Premier League substitute appearances for Newcastle in 2015-16, the sum of his top-flight career for the north-east side.After inadvertently denying his side their opener, Toney did score with his 21st successive converted penalty, early in the second half.He has been involved in eight of Brentford's 16 Premier League goals this season, scoring six - but it is at the other end of the field where their major problems lie.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63099426

A minute's applause took place before kick-off, during which Conte was in tears, and once the game got under way there appeared to be an extra element of determination from Spurs to get a result for Ventrone.They were more hungry than Brighton in the opening exchanges and deservedly took the lead through the header from Kane, who pointed to the sky when he celebrated.Tottenham were unable to kick on from that but did just enough to pick up their sixth win in nine Premier League games and ensure they remain firmly in the picture at the top end of the table.""It was a really tough week for us, not only for me - my staff and players and all the Tottenham environment,"" Spurs boss Conte said.""He [Ventrone] was a person who was in the heart of every single Tottenham person. It was really tough for us. It is very difficult for me to speak about the situation because it is difficult to understand what happened.""At the end, to win a game today against a really strong team like Brighton, it shows that I can count not only good players but also good men.""Clear signs of De Zerbi ball againBrighton 0-1 Tottenham: Roberto de Zerbi says result was not fairRoberto de Zerbi made an immediate impact by guiding Brighton to an impressive 3-3 draw at Liverpool in his first game in charge last week.The Seagulls had been crafted into an enjoyable team to watch by Graham Potter and De Zerbi has picked up from that while adding his own influence.Although they were not quite as direct and attacking as they were in the early stages of the Liverpool game, they nevertheless impressed once more against a Tottenham side that has started this season very well.Brighton built possession well, working the ball from left to right to try and pull Tottenham out of shape and they could have had a goal but for better finishing.The defeat ended their unbeaten run at home but there's a clear sign of how De Zerbi wants to play that will be encouraging for Brighton fans.""I must admit the result is not fair,"" De Zerbi said. ""After the first 15 minutes there was only one team on the pitch and that team was Brighton.""I don't believe in lucky or unlucky. The players were fantastic today but when one team played like that today it is a good message for the league for the future.""In the first half after 15-20 minutes, we played a good 25 minutes.

Cooper knew Awoniyi should have given Forest the lead and also that Lingard, signed amid much fanfare after the ex-Manchester United man was courted by so many clubs, needs to have a different kind of impact than the one that set Maddison up for the opener, which deceived Dean Henderson as it struck McKenna and flew into the corner.But his side are so obviously a work in progress. With so many new faces, the combinations required to be effective are absent. Cooper is trying to find answers in an unforgiving environment.Add in the touch of quality that allowed Barnes and Maddison to give Henderson no chance of keeping out shots that found the corner of his goal and it is easy to understand how, of these two sides, Leicester are the ones who have the ingredients to get out of trouble.Daka's well-taken fourth meant Cooper was experiencing his biggest loss as Forest manager since his first, another four-goal defeat by Fulham. Only Leicester have conceded more than Forest's 21 goals so far this season.Cooper largely found positive answers to the questions posed of him after that Fulham loss.

88,Man City 6-3 Man Utd: Erling Haaland and Phil Foden score hat-tricks,SUN 02 Oct 2022,premier-league,"Erling Haaland's third home hat-trick in a row further underlined his clinical finishingManchester City's Erling Haaland became the first player to score three successive Premier League home hat-tricks as Manchester United were humiliated in the derby at Etihad Stadium.Haaland's rampant start to the season continued as he made it 17 goals in 11 starts - a goal every 54 minutes - since his move from Borussia Dortmund while Phil Foden scored his first treble for City as they closed the gap on pace-setters Arsenal to one point.This was a brutal reality check for United after their recent improvement, as the reigning Premier League champions ran riot to illustrate the gulf in class between the teams.City's lightning start was rewarded when Foden swept home Bernardo Silva's cross after eight minutes before Haaland inevitably joined the action with a header from a corner 11 minutes before half-time.As United subsided, Haaland slid in a third from Kevin de Bruyne's perfect pass then turned provider to set up a simple finish for Foden before the break.United's new signing Antony replied with a superb goal from 25 yards to pull one back but it only provoked City to up the tempo again, Haaland thumping home his third from Sergio Gomez's cross then again showing he can be creator by setting up Foden for City's sixth.Haaland's third put him in the record books following hat-tricks at home to Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.Anthony Martial's late goal for United was greeted in near silence, as was his added-time penalty, on a day of embarrassment for the visitors and their manager Erik ten Hag and one of elation for City and Pep Guardiola.Football Daily podcast: Man City hat-trick heroes humiliate Man Utd'This was Pep's idea of perfect football'Lack of belief was unacceptable - Ten HagMan City 6-3 Man Utd: Lack of egos is secret of success - Pep GuardiolaWho can stop Man City and Haaland?Arsenal are worthy Premier League leaders but this was a frightening display of firepower from the reigning champions as they confirmed their status as firm favourites to win a fifth title in six years.City were clearly potent before the arrival of Haaland but he has put them on a different level, delivering the one thing they were arguably missing as he increases the ratio of chances they take with his ruthless finishing.Add the creativity, and on this day the goals, from Foden plus the genius of De Bruyne and it is hard to see how they can be stopped, with Haaland also looking as if he could be the missing link that might finally bring the Champions League to the Etihad.City blew United away as they started at lightning speed and went in 4-0 at half-time, referee Michael Oliver's whistle for the break coming as a merciful release for United.United's goal poked City into action with Antony's fine strike merely the catalyst for another onslaught, as Haaland scored the record-breaking third. Man City 6-3 Man Utd: Ten Hag criticises 'unacceptable' lack of belief from his playersAbject Man Utd put in their placeManchester United arrived at the Etihad fuelled by the optimism of four successive league wins but were brought down to earth by their rampant neighbours.United looked out of their depth within seconds of the start, surviving three goal-line clearances in the same incident before Foden set the tone for the afternoon when he flashed Silva's cross past a helpless David de Gea.Manager Ten Hag resisted the temptation to start with the experience of £70m signing from Real Madrid, Casemiro, as he stuck with Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Bruno Fernandes in midfield.It was a decision he may now regret as United were over-powered and over-run in all areas, unable to stem the tide and failing to cope with City's creation and the awesome power and athleticism of Haaland.The fact they scored more goals in the second half than City, including a beauty from new signing Antony, can hardly be labelled as a consolation as their recent upturn in results was put in perspective.If anyone at United thought those better results in the last few weeks meant they were moving closer to City, this scoreline - which actually flattered them - put a stop to those notions.Live text and radio of Sunday's Premier League matches",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63024245

That humility is a big driver for us,"" said Arteta.""We are focused on what we are doing and today is another sign that we are going in the right direction, that we can play at a really high level."" Arsenal growing in statureArsenal 3-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Arteta praises 'whole team' after derby winArsenal's outstanding start to the season, aided by some smart work in the transfer market in the summer, has raised hopes that they might be coming out of a long period of post-Arsene Wenger transition.The Gunners were bitterly disappointed to miss out on Champions League football on the final day of last season but there is an energy, verve and threat about Arsenal that suggests they can make a serious impact in this campaign.Even in defeat at Manchester United last month, Arsenal showed signs of maturity and progress, emphasised here by the manner of their victory over the old rivals.Arsenal flew out of the blocks to take the lead and even recovered from the frustration of handing an out-of-sorts Spurs a route back into the game via Gabriel's challenge on Richarlison.Jesus has proved to be a superb signing, while William Saliba has been outstanding in central defence since returning from loan spells at St Etienne, Nice and Marseille.There is still work to be done but Arsenal look like a club and a team who finally have a clear direction again, a mouth-watering mix of younger players and experience that bodes well for the future.Arteta now senses that after leading Arsenal to a third successive home win over Tottenham, both his players and the club's supporters are starting to believe they can maintain this success.""Hopefully it can give the players more belief that they can play at this level and play against any team, doing it in the right way that we want to play,"" he said.""We have connected with our supporters and when that happens that's a really powerful thing.""[The result] is really meaningful because you have the opportunity to give a lot of people happiness and a beautiful day and we have delivered that, so that's really fulfilling.""Arsenal's next game, here against Liverpool next Sunday, will be another significant test but there is growing confidence around Emirates Stadium.Spurs fall badly shortArsenal 3-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Derby defeat 'hard to accept', says ConteSpurs may argue over the merits of Emerson Royal's red card but it was a poor challenge in a position where he actually had no need to engage with Martinelli. Spurs manager Conte was instantly infuriated by the challenge itself although he was clearly not expecting the punishment that followed.Conte's side have not been pleasing on the eye this season but they have been digging out results until this first Premier League defeat of the campaign.Spurs had a spell of threat after Kane's penalty, and indeed the game's first big chance when Arsenal keeper Aaron Ramsdale blocked Richarlison, but they were lacklustre and dominated in all areas.There was no coming back after the sort of inexplicable mistake Lloris, for all his big reputation, can be guilty of committing, and Royal's red card only pushed any prospect of even a point further into the distance.Kane and Son Heung-min, who was later substituted along with Richarlison - Conte was trying to make three changes when Xhaka scored Arsenal's third - could not get into the game.Spurs were well beaten long before the end, Conte cut a resigned figure in his technical area and this was another miserable north London derby away day for manager, player and supporters.Reaction from Arsenal v Tottenham & Premier League updatesGo straight to all the best Arsenal contentVisit our Tottenham page",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63017880

However, there was controversy surrounding Aubameyang's goal as it was set up by Thiago Silva, who Palace felt should have been sent off for a deliberate handball which denied Jordan Ayew a possible goalscoring opportunity. ‘Unbelievable’, ‘strange’ and ‘frustrating’ - is VAR letting Premier League down?Visit our Crystal Palace pageGo straight to all the best Chelsea contentPalace furious over Silva handballSilva very lucky with handball decision - VieiraGallagher, whose impressive form for Palace last season earned him his England debut, was introduced by Potter in the 76th minute for Kai Havertz. And with the game seemingly petering out for a draw, the 22-year-old midfielder nutmegged Jean-Philippe Mateta before curling a shot into Vicente Guaita's top corner. However, while Gallagher returned to break Palace hearts, Eagles supporters will likely direct their ire towards the officials following the decision not to send Silva off. Just after the half-hour mark, the Chelsea defender appeared to deliberately handle the ball after falling to the ground, denying Ayew a possible goalscoring opportunity.Referee Chris Kavanagh showed the Brazilian a yellow card, which was upheld following a VAR check, much to the dismay of Palace boss Patrick Vieira - who was booked for his protests - and his players.Palace's sense of injustice deepened when Silva headed James' long ball into the path of Aubameyang, who produced a smart finish on the half-volley to bring Chelsea level. Potter 'delighted' with first Chelsea winBecause of the postponement of matches following the death of Queen Elizabeth II - for whom a minute's silence was observed before kick-off - and the international break, neither side had played a Premier League game since 3 September.And while Chelsea looked settled in possession early on, Palace took the lead with their first attack. Edouard pounced on a loose Wesley Fofana pass and found Ayew on the right. The Ghanaian's dipping cross found Edouard, who stretched to poke the ball past Kepa Arrizabalaga.With their tails up, the home side - who lost Nathaniel Clyne to a serious-looking injury before half-time - immediately pressed for a second as Kepa turned Eberechi Eze's shot from distance around the post with the Palace attacker firing narrowly wide from the resultant corner.Wilfried Zaha forced a sharp save from Kepa in the second half but Palace were unable to put the Chelsea defence under enough pressure, before Gallagher popped up to rub salt in the home side's wounds and get Potter off the mark as Blues boss.Aubameyang marked his Premier League return with a well-taken first-half equaliser for Chelsea",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63017875

His work sort of epitomises our play, so it was great to see,"" said Howe.""He's capable of doing magical things, and for me [his first goal] was a magical goal.""Fulham's day started poorly when Nathaniel Chalobah was shown a straight red card for a high challenge on Sean Longstaff in the eighth minute.'Unbelievable', 'strange' and 'frustrating' - is VAR letting Premier League down?Three minutes later Callum Wilson, returning from injury, tapped in Joe Willock's header, before Almiron effectively killed off the game in the 33rd minute with his looping volley.Longstaff added a third for the visitors just before the break, striking home a rebound after Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno tipped Sven Botman's header on to the post.And in the second half Almiron turned in his second, pouncing on a Willock pass across goal, before the hosts scored a late consolation, with Bobby Decordova-Reid heading home Neeskens Kebano's cross.Newcastle dominate with electric attackFulham 1-4 Newcastle United: Win over Fulham a 'fabulous feeling' says Eddie HoweWith striker Alexander Isak picking up a knock on international duty with Sweden, Almiron's slick display and Wilson's return to action after four games out with a hamstring injury could not have been more timely.""It's been a very difficult two weeks,"" Howe added to BBC Sport.

""Obviously the red card made it easier, but I am very pleased with the players' response.""Almiron's first-half strike was special. The Paraguayan found the net with a first-time volley, latching on to a looping pass from Bruno Guimaraes.And the 28-year-old thought he had scored a first Premier League hat-trick midway through the second half, chipping in a third only to see his effort ruled out by the offside flag.As for Wilson, the 30-year-old's opener means he has now scored four goals in four top-flight matches against the Cottagers.The former Bournemouth star had hit the post in the opening exchanges and went close to scoring a second in the 28th minute with a curling effort.Midfielder Joe Willock was also lively for Howe's side, picking up two assists and forcing fine diving saves from Leno either side of half-time.""We wanted more - we weren't happy with what we had, always trying to score,"" added Howe.Injuries hamper sorry FulhamStrange red card made big impact - SilvaReferee Darren England initially showed Chalobah a yellow card for his challenge on Longstaff but upgraded his decision to a red after VAR intervention.Once Fulham went behind, there only seemed to be one winner.Things went from bad to worse for Marco Silva's side when star striker and former Magpie Aleksandar Mitrovic limped off in the 37th minute.

Trossard got the first after just four minutes when he thumped into the bottom corner from Danny Welbeck's pass before adding a second in near identical fashion 13 minutes later, this time from Solly March's ball.Roberto Firmino started a Liverpool fightback before half-time when he drove in, with the goal given by the video assistant referee (VAR) after initially being ruled out for offside.The Brazilian equalised nine minutes after the break when substitute Luis Diaz found Firmino, who coolly wrongfooted his marker before firing in from close range.There was a sense of inevitability as a hungry Liverpool continued to come forward and they duly got a third when Adam Webster turned into his own net under pressure from Firmino.But Trossard had the final say as he scooped in at the back post late on to secure the match ball and a point for his side.The draw means Brighton remain fourth but Liverpool are ninth, 11 points behind leaders Arsenal but with one game in hand.Read reaction to Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Liverpool contentGVisit our Brighton & Hove Albion pageA stirring fightback, but Reds undone by another poor startLiverpool could have won but didn't deserve to - KloppThis was a game that arguably highlighted both the best and worst of this current Liverpool side.On the one hand, their fightback was like the Liverpool of old where, after a dreadful first 25 minutes, there was the growing sense the Reds would get themselves ahead at some point.But on the other hand, it was another poor start that ultimately cost them the three points.Liverpool have now conceded the first goal in five of their seven Premier League games this season and working out how to get the Reds starting on the front foot once again is the challenge facing manager Jurgen Klopp at the moment.The determination and character that took Liverpool to within a point of champions Manchester City last season is there but they need to rediscover their focus before the title race slips away from them.Life after Potter looks entertaining Brighton had chances to win - De ZerbiBrighton fans travelled in good numbers despite the distance and rail disruption to witness first hand what a team under De Zerbi looked like.The Italian has replaced Graham Potter, who left before the international break to join Chelsea and Seagulls fans have been promised entertaining but risky football from their new manager.That was certainly evident in a game they could have won 6-3 but equally could have lost by the same scoreline.They were energetic and direct in the first 25 minutes and though they tired after that, they showed plenty of spirit to get back level in the closing stages.It is still very early days but the signs are encouraging that life after Potter will be an exciting one under De Zerbi.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63017881

We are not in good form so something needs to change. The people [fans] don't deserve to see what we are doing at the moment.""It is not the manager's responsibility it is everyone. We are the ones that can get the results. It is about us, not anybody else. We struggled a bit in the beginning with a lot of new players, a lot of players going out, but no more excuses.""In contrast, West Ham forwards Gianluca Scamacca and Jarrod Bowen were the inspiration behind their comfortable victory.Italy international Scamacca, making only his second start in the English top flight following his £30.5m arrival from Sassuolo, opened the scoring with a superb half-volley into the top-right corner.It delivered the Hammers' first goal prior to half-time this term and laid the platform for a valuable win that lifted David Moyes' side up from 18th to 15th in the table. The hosts had started the day as the joint-lowest scorers in the division along with Wolves, but always looked the more threatening and deservedly added to their lead when Bowen drove a low effort past Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.Costa had the visitor's best opportunity but he headed just wide from a teasing Adama Traore cross.However, encouragingly for Lage, the former Spain international appeared relatively sharp given his long period of inaction and looked to have supplied an assist for Daniel Podence's tap-in before being adjudged to have run marginally offside.Follow all Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best West Ham contentVisit our Wolves pageHammers hit form as Wolves' woes continueMoyes praise for 'brilliant' West Ham goalsWhile West Ham have won four times in European competition this season, that form has not been reproduced domestically. However, a fixture against a Wolves side who have now failed to win in their last eight matches on their travels served up a perfect opportunity for Moyes and his side to remedy some early-season problems. Craig Dawson's return in defence, alongside Kurt Zouma and the impressive Thilo Kehrer, provided some added steel to deliver a first clean sheet at home since beating Wolves 1-0 in February. Further up the pitch, Bowen was the perfect foil to Scamacca's power and capped a fine performance, full of elusive running, with a clinical finish as he opened his account in the league this season.With their Portuguese contingent, Wolves became the first Premier League side to start a match with eight players from the same non-English nationality.Yet despite creating several promising openings Lage's side only found the target four times from their 15 efforts on goal and none seriously threatened to beat home goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.Wolves need strikers - Lage'No decision has been made on Lage's future' - analysisBBC Sport's Simon Stone: After one win in 15 Premier League games going back to last season, travelling fans in mutinous mood and their club in the relegation zone - and potentially dropping to second bottom on Monday evening - minds are being focused within the Wolves hierarchy about the future of manager Lage.Chairman Jeff Shi will be responsible for implementing any decision to sack Lage, with the Portuguese's fate to be decided by Shi and Fosun executives in China.Sources are stressing no decision has been made yet. But Wolves must decide whether to back Lage to drag the club away from trouble or cut their losses on the 46-year-old former Benfica coach, who replaced Nuno Espirito Santo at the start of last season.Although it took them some time to bring in the number of players Lage wanted this summer, Wolves have spent heavily, more than £100m, to bring in five senior players.But they had to move for the out-of-contract Costa after injuries to Jimenez and Kalajdzic, who ruptured his cruciate knee ligaments on his debut, left him without a senior striker.However, despite this - and the knowledge they will have to take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge next Saturday without defender Nathan Collins and skipper Neves due to suspension - the feeling is Lage should be getting far more out of his group.Wolves have scored only three times this season, two less than Nottingham Forest and West Ham, the Premier League's next lowest scorers, and while their approach play is often eye-catching, the impact turns out to be harmless.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63017873

The current tally is Haaland 11, Wolves three.For context, when Mohamed Salah broke the record for goals in a 38-game season in 2017-18, he had found the net on four occasions after seven games.Haaland's latest effort was unusual in that he scored it from outside the penalty area.Erling Haaland has scored 14 goals in 10 matches in all competitions for Manchester City so far this seasonReceiving possession inside the Wolves half, Haaland was allowed to turn and run before drilling a low shot past Jose Sa.In doing so, he became the first player to score in their first four Premier League away games.Haaland also provided the pass from which De Bruyne created Foden's second-half goal.While there is too much time left in the season to make concrete judgements, on current evidence it is hard to see how Haaland, or champions City, can be stopped in terms of the title.A tough task made impossible for WolvesWolves made mistakes with the ball - Bruno LageAn already tough assignment for Wolves was made impossible after barely half an hour.The game had barely started before Grealish scored. Although the former Aston Villa man was the subject of home fans' ire after Collins' dismissal, the blame lay squarely with the home defender, a £20m summer signing from Burnley.Collins is still finding his feet at Molineux and a three-match ban that will rule the defender out of league matches against West Ham, Chelsea and Nottingham Forest will not help that process.At least Collins knows what he is dealing with, though.Wolves paid a club record £38m initial fee for Matheus Nunes. The former Sporting Lisbon man is struggling to make an impact.At one point in the first half, the midfielder lost possession near the halfway line, then chased after three City players who completed a neat triangle of passes and moved the ball out towards the touchline without Nunes getting near enough to make a tackle.As good a talent as he is, Nunes is finding out what an unforgiving environment he is operating in, which is why Costa could not be risked, even for a 10-minute cameo off the bench, given how short of fitness he is.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62859266

As at all Premier League games this weekend there was a minute's silence before kick-off, which was impeccably observed, for the late Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II followed by the national anthem. There was also stadium-wide applause in the 70th minute in honour of her 70-year reign.Visit our Newcastle United pageGo straight to all the best Bournemouth contentCutting edge lacking for both sidesIt has been a frustrating start to the season for Newcastle with goals hard to come by, and this will be another game where they will feel they should have taken three points.They were dominant for large periods - they had 72% possession and 20 attempts at goal - but again lacked a clinical edge.They had chances with a Trippier free-kick and a cushioned Joelinton effort both striking posts in the first half. Bournemouth's summer signing Neto also tipped away efforts from Joelinton and Ryan Fraser, but the latter, who earned a recall to the Scotland squad this week, and Miguel Almiron spurned good opportunities. It left Newcastle co-owner Amanda Staveley looking unimpressed in the stands, with the results this season not yet matching Newcastle's lofty ambitions.Howe was similarly frustrated, telling BBC Sport: ""I don't think we played particularly well, we were off our best level. One for us to reflect on.""I am desperate to win, it feels like a long time for us. We need to win and compete and be the best versions of us.""Newcastle 1-1 Bournemouth: Newcastle became too 'desperate' for goals - HoweA period of change may be forthcoming at Bournemouth too, with a Las Vegas consortium hoping to buy the club.It has left uncertainty about the manager's role with O'Neil now in charge since Scott Parker was sacked on 30 August, but it has hard to argue with the results that the former Portsmouth and Middlesbrough midfielder has produced. Bournemouth looked organised and were prepared to put their bodies on the line, while on another day they could have taken three points as Marcus Tavernier headed wide in the first period before driving wide in the second.Whether O'Neil will be in charge when Bournemouth host Brentford on 1 October - the next round of Premier League fixtures after the international break - remains to be seen.""I will be finding out what's happening club-wise next week and will see what the plan is,"" O'Neil told BBC Sport.""I have no idea what's happening - I knew I was taking today and I don't know about further, I guess I'll find out tomorrow.""Newcastle United 1-1 Bournemouth: My future still unknown - Gary O'Neil",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62859267

A Daka own goal was ruled out for a foul by Sanchez on Ward, who also tipped a header from the Spurs defender onto the bar later in the first half.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62859265

Villa secured only their second Premier League win of the season as Jacob Ramsey scored the only goal of the game, and Gerrard said his side reacted to the criticism they had faced.""It wasn't pretty or stylish but, with where we were in the league, we knew we had to do it in a pragmatic way,"" said Gerrard.""I'm really proud of the boys' effort, application and commitment. We played better than we did last time. In football, you have to grind and fight and be committed and we worked hard today.""We will get better in terms of style and possession and that will come but tonight was about the points.""Gerrard's side have made an indifferent start to the campaign but they were able to build on the battling draw against Manchester City with a deserved victory.He added: ""We had to back up our performance against Manchester City and there were a lot of eyes on us from the TV but we did it.""Maybe we tried to force it a bit tonight but as we move up the table, maybe that's when the pretty stuff will come. It has been a tough period but I've wanted to step forward and protect my players. ""I've tried to fight and move up this table. We have accepted a lot of criticism and it's about reacting and that is what we have done tonight.""Villa made nearly all the running in a game desperately short on quality and Ramsey broke the deadlock four minutes before the break after Southampton keeper Gavin Bazunu turned Ollie Watkins' header on to the bar.Southampton were far too timid and barely offered a threat all night, allowing Villa to close out an important triumph, their first since the second league game of the season against Everton, in comfort.Follow live text updates of Aston Villa v SouthamptonGo straight to all the best Aston Villa contentVisit our Southampton pageVilla grind out vital winThe pretty stuff will come - Gerrard on 'pragmatic' winAston Villa managerGerrard turned to his backroom staff with fists clenched at the final whistle. It was a signal of just how much he and his team needed this win.It was, to be brutally honest, a dreadful game lacking in quality, but Gerrard will not care as Villa will take wins any way they can get them at the moment after a poor start to the season led to discontent among their supporters and scrutiny of the manager.Villa started to rebuild when they took a point off Premier League champions Manchester City in their last home game, making further progress here with a win essential.The winning goal from Ramsey was scrappy, totally befitting such a poor game, and was more than enough to see off Southampton, who hardly gave Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez an anxious moment all night, with Tyrone Mings dealing easily with any rare aerial threat.It was not pleasing on the eye but Villa fully merited the win which will put Gerrard, his players and the club in a much more optimistic frame of mind heading into the international break.Tame Saints get what they deserveVilla match did not have much to do with football - HasenhuttlSouthampton's timid approach should mean they reflect on this defeat at Aston Villa as an opportunity missed.Villa's confidence would have still been fragile after their recent struggles, despite that good result against Manchester City, and an early goal - or even some early concerted pressure - could have played on nerves in the home crowd.Instead, Ralph Hasenhuttl's side allowed Villa to set the tempo as their captain John McGinn crunched into some early challenges and Philippe Coutinho offered up occasional moments of class while Saints struggled for any rhythm.Che Adams and Adam Armstrong hardly got a look in as Southampton barely created even half chances, the visitors' lack of attacking ambition and intent costing them dearly as the game was won by that one moment near the end of the first half.Hasenhuttl's Southampton sides pride themselves on energy and intensity but there was precious little on show here on a night they will want to quickly forget.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62845794

As well some games in the beginning of the season we should have got more points because we deserved it,"" said Silva.""But it is just seven games. It is the start of the season. We go into the international break with confidence then we prepare for the next one. ""A lot of fights ahead of us.

Momentum switched back to Steve Cooper's side but time ran out to score another as Fulham clung on for a victory which saw them move up to sixth place in the table.""It was a fantastic feeling for us even if we suffered a little in the last few minutes and they had belief they could score again,"" added Silva. ""I have to congratulate the players because it is really tough to do something they have done. It's the way we work and prepare for the game to learn every single day. ""We are a group and a unit working hard to achieve. We believe in ourselves and always trust in ourselves.""Silva congratulates Fulham players on comebackMeanwhile, it was the second Premier League match in a row Forest have thrown away a lead after their 2-0 advantage over Bournemouth ended in a 3-2 victory for the Cherries two weeks ago.Fulham, who finished 10 points ahead of Forest in the Championship last season, had chances in both halves but were also heavily tested by the hosts.Awoniyi and Morgan Gibbs-White both came close for Forest, while goalkeeper Dean Henderson was forced into saves to deny Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic, Kenny Tete and Andreas Pereira.In the end, a ruthless six minutes from Fulham did the damage as Forest were again humbled by the harsh realities of life back in the top flight.Both teams had observed a minute's silence prior to kick-off, before supporters sang the national anthem and applauded on the 70th minute in tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II. Reaction to Friday's Premier LeagueForest concede more as Fulham continue progress This was a match-up between two teams who spent last season battling in the Championship and it had the same physical edge to a game you would expect to see in the second tier of English football.Both teams were full of energy and aggression which made for an intriguing spectacle at the City Ground.Tackles flew in at both ends of the pitch - Steve Cook was perhaps fortunate to receive just a yellow card for a foul on Fulham's Willian when he was through on goal, while Issa Diop clattered into Forest's Johnson to concede a wasted free-kick on the edge of the box later in the first half.But as the game developed the battles became less equal and momentum swung in favour of either team in large spells.Fulham appeared to be in control when leading 3-1 before Lingard's superb flick helped set-up O'Brien's goal, making for a nervous ending in Nottingham.Forest pushed and pushed for an equaliser - while Fulham still had chances of their own - before eventually the visitors could settle things down again and see out the win.Cooper's side have already shown plenty of threat during their short time in the Premier League but they have now conceded 14 goals in their last four defeats, which will need to be addressed.""It has happened again. A few games now we have taken the lead and not managed it well enough,"" said Forest boss Cooper.Cooper says Forest problems are self-inflicted""We are not handling conceding the first goal. It has cost us the last two games. You cannot do that at any level, particularly this one. It is something we need to improve on.""There are times when I see good things and we look like a progressive team.

104,Brighton 5-2 Leicester: Graham Potter's side maintain excellent start to Premier League season,SUN 04 Sept 2022,premier-league,"Brighton came ninth in the Premier League last season - the highest top-flight finish in their historyBrighton fought back from conceding a first-minute goal to beat struggling Leicester City in a seven-goal thriller at the Amex.Leicester, bottom of the Premier League, scored after only 51 seconds when Kelechi Iheanacho finished from Patson Daka's pull-back from the left.However, the lead only lasted eight minutes before Solly March's header deflected into the net off Leicester defender Luke Thomas.Brighton went ahead in the 15th minute, capitalising on a loose pass from James Maddison with Moises Caicedo scoring after being set up by Enock Mwepu.But in a frantic first half, Leicester scored again after 32 minutes. Youri Tielemans, deep inside his own half, played a ball over the top of the Brighton defence, Daka held off Lewis Dunk's challenge and slotted the ball past Robert Sanchez for 2-2.Alexis Mac Allister thought he had restored the Seagulls' lead with a spectacular strike from 30 yards but, after a video assistant referee check that lasted more than four minutes, the goal was eventually ruled out for offside.Is Leicester's fairytale coming to an end?It did not prove to be crucial as Leandro Trossard scored Brighton's third from Pascal Gross' pass, with Trossard then winning a penalty, which Mac Allister converted for the fourth.Fittingly, the last say went to Argentina midfielder Mac Allister who curled in an excellent 25-yard free-kick in injury time for his second goal and Brighton's fifth.The result maintains Brighton's excellent start to the season and they are fourth in the Premier League, while Leicester, with just one point from six matches, are three points adrift at the foot of the table.Follow Sunday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion contentVisit our Leicester City pageBrighton 5-2 Leicester: Alexis Mac Allister 'incredible' against Foxes - Graham PotterVAR is involved againIt has been a weekend full of controversial VAR decisions, with Newcastle United and West Ham furious after being denied goals against Crystal Palace and Chelsea respectively on Saturday.While the match at the Amex was taking place, it was announced the Premier League is to review controversial decisions in those matches with referees' body PGMOL as a matter of priority.VAR was heavily involved at the Amex, with a lengthy delay to decide whether to allow Mac Allister's superb strike in the second half which, if given, would have been one of the goals of the season.Brighton's free-kick had been played into the penalty area with Mwepu trying an acrobatic overhead kick, although he failed to make contact with the ball and Leicester's James Justin partially headed clear before Mac Allister smashed the ball into the top corner.But after the lengthy stoppage, referee Tony Harrington checked a pitchside monitor and judged that Mwepu, who was offside, had interfered with play.Luckily for Mac Allister, he still managed to get on the scoresheet twice. The first was a penalty down the middle after superb skill from Trossard had drawn a foul inside the penalty area from Wilfred Ndidi, before a stunning curling free-kick with the last action of the match.Worrying times for LeicesterBrighton 5-2 Leicester: 'Results down to me', says Brendan RodgersLeicester, Premier League champions in 2015-16, have finished in the top 10 in all of the past five seasons, narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification in 2019-20 and 2020-21.In May, they played in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League, but Foxes fans will be deeply concerned that they will face a relegation battle this season.Earlier this week, manager Brendan Rodgers had expressed his frustration at the club's business during the summer transfer window, which saw them lose both goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and central defender Wesley Fofana.Rodgers made two changes from the 11 that began the 1-0 loss against Manchester United on Thursday with Daka and Iheanacho replacing Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Jamie Vardy.The decision instantly paid off as the visitors went ahead with their first attack. Tielemans dispossessed March, Harvey Barnes played it wide to Daka and his cross was met by Iheanacho for the game's first goal.But Rodgers will be furious at his side's defending throughout the match.An unmarked March headed against the unsuspecting Thomas for Brighton's first goal, before Maddison's error led to the second.Daka scored to make it 2-2 and give Leicester hope of picking up their first win of the season. But the visitors were overwhelmed by an excellent Brighton performance in the second half and the three goals the Foxes conceded meant it was their heaviest defeat of the campaign.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62704218

However, after their excellent start to the season, manager Mikel Arteta will be concerned at how easily his side were opened up, although the Gunners did have a first-half Gabriel Martinelli goal ruled out by VAR.""The game was there for the taking,"" Arteta said. ""We haven't won it because we lacked some discipline in some moments and we weren't ruthless enough in front of goal.""If we play with more courage we win the game. It is a big lesson - if you want to win here you have to do everything so right.""Antony the centre of attentionMan Utd 3-1 Arsenal: Red Devils' spirit and mentality has ""really improved"" - Erik ten HagHaving failed to prise Antony out of Ajax at the start of the summer and with the attempt to sign Ten Hag's first choice transfer window target Frenkie de Jong stalling, United went back for the Brazilian in the wake of those awful defeats to Brighton and Brentford at the start of the season.Evidently, United were not in a strong bargaining position and the eventual price - the fourth highest sum ever paid by a Premier League club - is accepted by most to be significantly inflated.Yet it is impossible to quantify financially how a positive attitude transfers to supporters.It was clear, with his tricks and flicks and teasing of defenders, the 24-year-old is not short on confidence.Referee Paul Tierney, who played an excellent advantage for the Brazilian's goal after Bruno Fernandes had been fouled in the build-up, had to warn him about his celebration in front of the Arsenal fans with the ball up his shirt.Not long after that, Antony was upended from behind by Granit Xhaka. Had he connected with his immediate response, trying to slice Xhaka down from behind, the response from Tierney would almost certainly have been more than a ticking off.The United fans loved it all. And while he lasted less than an hour before being replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, Antony was afforded a standing ovation as he left the field. However Antony's time at Old Trafford works out, it isn't likely to be dull.Disappointing result but Arsenal need not despairMan Utd 3-1 Arsenal: Gunners failed to 'kill game' after equaliser - Mikel ArtetaAlthough they failed in their attempt to start the season with six wins in a row for the first time since 1947, it wasn't a completely disastrous day for Arsenal.In the current climate, Martin Odegaard bundling Eriksen over to win possession and start the move that led to Martinelli finding the net was always going to see the goal ruled out.However, Arteta spent a long time debating with fourth official Simon Hooper about Lisandro Martinez's penalty box lunge on Saka, where he did touch the man and not the ball.Arsenal should have equalised when Gabriel Jesus got the better of Martinez and set up Odegaard but neither the Norwegian, nor Saka as Arsenal continued to press could find the target  when well placed to do much better.David de Gea acrobatically denied Martinelli as well, so Arsenal did have the opportunities to make more of their dominance of possession.Odegaard and Xhaka were excellent in midfield and it is clear they have a more consistent goal threat with Jesus in their side.However, immediately after this month's international break, the Gunners have a five-match sequence that includes home games against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City. After these, far more will be known about this Arsenal side.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62704217
106,Everton 0-0 Liverpool: Both sides hit woodwork in goalless draw,SAT 03 Sept 2022,premier-league,"Everton v Liverpool has seen more goalless draws than any fixture in English top-flight history (36)Everton and Liverpool fought out an eventful Merseyside derby draw at Goodison Park. In a game that swung from end to end, Tom Davies hit the woodwork for Everton while Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz suffered a similar fate for Liverpool. Everton keeper Jordan Pickford turned Nunez's shot on to the bar brilliantly and also denied Liverpool substitute Roberto Firmino on three separate occasions while Mohamed Salah hit the post again in the final seconds. Former Liverpool defender Conor Coady thought he had broken the deadlock against his former club when he turned in debutant Neal Maupay's shot but the goal was disallowed after a lengthy VAR intervention. As well as Coady's disallowed goal, Everton forced two outstanding saves from Liverpool keeper Alisson as he denied Maupay and Dwight McNeil, whose shot was deflected towards the top corner.Pickford shows class as Everton begin to take shapeEverton to ban fans after Merseyside derby incidentsPickford shows why he's England's best Frank Lampard hails Everton's spirit in derby drawJordan Pickford has barely made a mistake for England and yet has to deal with constant noise about his position being under threat. Manager Gareth Southgate ignores it and Pickford is making his case by displaying the finest form of his career at Everton. Pickford was magnificent in this goalless draw with a succession of outstanding stops to keep Everton on level terms, although there was also much to admire from Frank Lampard's side in other areas. He displayed great athleticism to turn Nunez's shot on to the bar in the first half, showed great reflexes and agility in denying Firmino three times, and then pounced at his near post to touch Salah's shot on to the post with virtually the last kick of the game. It would have been harsh on Pickford to end up on the losing side after a performance that must rank among the finest of his career.

Even though the visitors were denied by the woodwork three times, as well as by the inspired Pickford, this was still way short of their best. Trent Alexander-Arnold was disappointing once more before he was substituted and while Liverpool carried threat, they were also vulnerable at the back with Virgil van Dijk shown a yellow card for a crude challenge on Amadou Onana. Klopp will be delighted to have seen Diogo Jota back in action as substitute late on but the overall result will disappoint a manager so well versed in victory over recent years, with only two wins and nine points - the German's lowest points tally with Liverpool after six Premier League games.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62697702
107,Brentford 5-2 Leeds United: Ivan Toney passes 50 goals for Bees with stunning hat-trick,SAT 03 Sept 2022,premier-league,"Brentford boss Thomas Frank backed Ivan Toney for an England call-up after the striker passed the 50 goal mark for Brentford in style with a superb hat-trick against Leeds.Toney opened the scoring with a penalty, awarded after a foul by Luis Sinisterra and a long VAR intervention, then doubled the hosts' lead with a superb free-kick, and chipped in his third after the break.""Off the top of my head, looking at strikers on form, Harry Kane is number one but there is not a better striker after Kane on form,"" said Frank.""I don't see a better one. Plus England have been in a few penalty shootouts and if they want to win one, they need to pick Ivan.""Sinisterra had made it 2-1 just before half-time, but then came Toney's hat-trick goal and a red card for Leeds boss Jesse Marsch, who was sent off after urging referee Robert Jones to use the monitor to review a challenge by Aaron Hickey on Crysencio Summerville.Marc Roca gave the visitors hope again, but Bryan Mbeumo put Brentford 4-2 up before Yoane Wissa added a late fifth.The win lifted Brentford to seventh in the table, while Leeds slipped to ninth after their second successive Premier League defeat, and are still seeking their first victory on the road this season.Talisman Toney too good for LeedsIvan Toney 'best penalty taker in the world' - Thomas FrankToney's landmark goal to open the scoring might not have had too many home fans anticipating a record-breaking afternoon for Brentford.Leeds had been a threat during an entertaining first half, but went behind when Toney brought up his half-century for the club in the 30th minute, placing a powerful spot-kick beyond Illan Meslier after Sinisterra was judged to have fouled the striker following a pitchside monitor check by Jones.As with his penalty, Toney scarcely took a run-up on his way to sending the free-kick flying into the left-hand corner of Meslier's net, demonstrating his expert technique and amplifying arguments for his inclusion in the Three Lions' squad for their Nations League fixtures later this month.Marsch was baffled by the penalty award and infuriated when Leeds were denied one of their own after an appeal he felt was far stronger. ""I've got to figure out how to have discussions with the league or with referees to help understand how some decisions get made,"" he said.""I was speaking with the fourth official, trying to be as respectful as I possibly could, even when a penalty was given that I probably didn't think was a penalty.""And then you don't see it reciprocated, the respect. That's what I would call it. That lack of VAR visit, in the end to me, is a lack of respect.""I don't know what else to do  - Jesse Marsch on VAR 'frustration'Summer signing Sinisterra atoned for his costly foul on Toney with a third goal in three starts for his new club shortly before the break, skipping past Rico Henry after collecting a Ben Mee flick and drilling a composed low finish beyond the advancing David Raya.Toney punished Leeds to make it three before the hour mark, seizing on a defensive mix-up when Diego Llorente failed to clear with a perfectly weighted chip from outside the penalty area to beat the stranded Meslier and desperately backtracking captain Robin Koch.Brentford had not scored five times in a top-flight game since 1938, and Frank's side deserved the club's largest-ever haul in a Premier League match.The head coach called Toney ""a nightmare to play against"". The man leading their line is brimming with confidence - and Kane is the only Englishman to have matched his five league goals so far this season.Visit our Brentford pageGo straight to all the best Leeds United content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62697699
108,Chelsea 2-1 West Ham United: David Moyes furious at 'scandalous' VAR,SAT 03 Sept 2022,premier-league,"Kai Havertz combined with fellow susbtitute Ben Chilwell to win it for ChelseaSubstitute Kai Havertz scored a late winner as Chelsea recovered to record a dramatic victory over West Ham, though David Moyes was left furious by a ""scandalous"" decision to rule out a 90th-minute Hammers equaliser. Maxwel Cornet pounced after Edouard Mendy parried the ball into his path, but referee Andrew Madley was told to consult the pitchside monitor and then ruled Jarrod Bowen had fouled the Chelsea goalkeeper in the build-up.The Hammers frustrated Chelsea in a first half that saw plenty of home possession but no shots on target for either side, and looked to have executed their gameplan to perfection when Michail Antonio scored after 62 minutes, bundling in from close range after Mendy failed to deal with a corner.Chelsea, on the back of a record summer of spending and with £70m arrival Wesley Fofana making his debut, brought on Ben Chilwell and he snuck in to level from a tight angle.It sparked a frantic finish, with Cornet almost winning it late on for the visitors, only to see his header come back off the post and the Blues immediately score themselves through a clinical Havertz finish from Chilwell's cross.There was still time for more drama and Cornet thought he had levelled with a strike that was then disallowed.""It is a scandalous decision,"" Moyes told Match of the Day. ""I always thought he would say it is a goal once he went to the screen - I have seen it from all angles and find it incredibly difficult to see how that is chalked off.""Follow Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Chelsea contentVisit our West Ham pageBlues get down to business after record windowThe most expensive transfer window from any British club in history is over and now the real business begins for Thomas Tuchel and his side, with the expectation on £255m-worth of new additions to deliver results. Fofana was handed his debut after arriving from Leicester City for £70m in a side that also included statement signings Kalidou Koulibaly, Marc Cucurella and Raheem Sterling.However, it needed two players bought in the previous two summers to spark Chelsea into life at Stamford Bridge after falling behind to a scrappy Antonio opener.Thomas Tuchel agrees with 'lucky' VAR callFirst Chilwell - jostling for that left-sided spot with Cucurella - showed his class with a smart touch and neat finish from a narrow angle to pull the hosts level with 14 minutes remaining, and it was the England international who then provided the cross for Havertz to put Tuchel's side in front in the 88th minute.That good work was almost wiped out when Cornet found the roof of the net after another mix-up in the Chelsea defence, and there were relieved faces in the Blues side when the verdict was a foul on goalkeeper Mendy in the build-up.It was a dramatic ending to what, for an hour, had been a dull affair.Christian Pulisic has been used sparingly this season, though his USA boss Gregg Berhalter has tipped the winger to ""prove everyone wrong"", and he had the game's first shot in the 27th minute that deflected wide for a Chelsea corner, though neither side managed to hit the target until almost the hour mark. That was a delightful volley from Bowen that forced Mendy into a save, and from the resulting corner came the goal - Mendy failed to deal with a flick-on, Declan Rice knocked it back across goal and Antonio nudged in from close range.Tuchel was aggrieved, feeling there was a foul on his goalkeeper, but he was happy with the resilience his side showed, and the quality Chelsea could bring off the bench to turn the encounter in their favour is a sign of the strength in depth the lavishly assembled Blues now possess. It gives Chelsea their third win of the season and takes them to fifth, while West Ham sit 18th.'A ridiculously bad decision'David Moyes says VAR decision was 'scandalous'It has taken a while for West Ham to get going this season but a win at Aston Villa and a well-earned point against Tottenham have given Moyes' side some belief, and the visitors will feel they should also have taken something from Stamford Bridge.A disciplined display kept Chelsea at bay for the most part and, had Cornet turned his late header inside the post rather than against it, the Hammers would likely have been leaving with three points.It was a Cornet strike that did find the net that left Moyes furious, though, with Bowen adjudged to have caught goalkeeper Mendy before the ball fell to his team-mate.Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

I'd question VAR as much as the referee, but the referee should have stuck to his own guns - there is no excuse for that not to be a goal, none whatsoever. The sad thing is this is the level of the weak refereeing at the moment.""I think the worst thing is we're sitting and watching it. We've been told there would be more contact. But that sounds as if there's no contact with any goalies, and we didn't get told that."" Moyes, who also accused Mendy of trying to ""fake an injury"" when West Ham scored the opening goal, said he was ""embarrassed"" for VAR official Jarred Gillett.""Jarrod [Bowen] said he never touched the goalkeeper at all,"" he added. ""And if you look at it, he jumps him. There might have been a trailing foot if there was anything at all.""I make loads of mistakes, referees can make loads of mistakes, but I would hope if the referee made a mistake that's why it's corrected by VAR.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62701648
109,Newcastle United 0-0 Crystal Palace: Hosts denied as goal ruled out by VAR,SAT 03 Sept 2022,premier-league,"Joe Willock was adjudged to have fouled the Palace goalkeeper before Tyrick Mitchell put the ball in his own netNewcastle boss Eddie Howe said he was ""very surprised"" by the video assistant referee's decision to rule out a goal in a stalemate with Crystal Palace. The hosts were initially awarded a goal by referee Michael Salisbury when Tyrick Mitchell knocked the ball into his own net. But after a VAR review, it was ruled that Joe Willock had fouled Vicente Guaita moments beforehand, although replays showed how Mitchell appeared to push the Newcastle man into the Palace goalkeeper. Newcastle had already been left frustrated after record signing Alexander Isak fluffed an attempt to dink the ball over Guaita when clean through, while Miguel Almiron also hit the post with a deflected shot.Palace - who, like Newcastle, have only won once this season - did not severely test home goalkeeper Nick Pope until a late improvement, when Odsonne Edouard's close-range shot forced him to save.But, after Willock shinned wide from two yards late on, the point will be welcome for Patrick Vieira's side, who earned their third draw of the season.Newcastle are now winless in five games for the first time under Howe, but he said he disagreed with the decision to disallow the own goal. Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer said it was ""pathetic"" to rule it out.  Howe added: ""I thought it was a push on Joe Willock in the build-up to the ball coming in. Without that push, there's no way Joe would have gone in with that force. So for me, it's not a foul, if anything, it's a penalty if it's not a goal.""Newcastle 0-0 Crystal Palace: Eddie Howe says Magpies disallowed goal should have stoodIsak fluffs chance as Newcastle wasteful Newcastle and their noisy supporters will have felt aggrieved by the result, especially as some of the crowd were able to watch a replay of the game's biggest talking point on the big screen.From one angle, it appeared as if Willock took Guaita out, but another view showed how Mitchell was the architect of the collision that left the Newcastle player needing treatment.Nonetheless referee Salisbury overturning his initial decision led to a smattering of boos at full-time.It was a disappointing return to St James' Park for Newcastle after pushing Liverpool so close in Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield and also sharing a 3-3 draw with Manchester City on their last home outing.They paid for wasteful finishing, with record £60m signing Isak failing to back up his thrilling debut in midweek, where he scored against Liverpool.Having begun brightly at both ends of the pitch, the Swede could have made himself an instant hero in front of the Gallowgate End, as he dispossessed Joachim Andersen on the halfway line but chose to chip Guaita and got it all wrong.The 22-year-old also had a good chance in the second half but his shot was tame, and it summed up a poor game in front of goal for Howe's side, who are missing Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin and Bruno Guimaraes through injury.Howe said of the Swedish international: ""He will be disappointed to miss that because I think he would back himself to score and I'd certainly back him to score but he's gone for a certain type of finish but he didn't quite execute it right. ""I thought we starved him of with the ball a little bit and I desperately wanted him to try and get on the ball more, especially in the attacking third. ""It's just that he's had no training time with us. So he's been thrust right into action and I think he's done very well but there's a lot of improvement for us as a team to try and serve him.""In fairness to Isak, there were more chances that fell to Willock and Almiron, but despite spending £117m in the transfer window, it shows an area of the pitch where Newcastle are perhaps still lacking depth.Palace frustrating but snatch pointPatrick Vieira: 'Palace needed to defend well and we did'Palace have shown a threat this season by going ahead away from home against both Liverpool and Manchester City - although they ended up with a point at Anfield and a 4-2 defeat at Etihad Stadium.But at St James' Park, they could not match Newcastle's energy, and although they carved out several decent first-half chances, none of them really tested Pope.Wilfried Zaha, who has scored 13 goal in 20 Premier League appearances this calendar year, was frustrated in his attempts to beat Kieran Trippier or Pope. Eberechi Eze and Jean-Philippe Mateta also wasted good opportunities. The fact the game was goalless going into the second half was down to Newcastle's wastefulness and some fine Palace defending. Guaita stopped efforts from Sean Longstaff and Sven Botman, while the Dutch defender was also denied by an amazing block by Marc Guehi. After the hosts started the second half on top once more, Patrick Vieira made a triple substitution to try to revive Palace, and it almost paid off immediately. Edouard finally made Pope stretch to make a fine save after twisting and turning in the box. As the game opened up, there were further chances but Palace failed to find the final pass and somehow managed to hang on at the other end.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62697713

""I haven't spoken to anybody about it, I have been told to take the team today and until further notice. As far as I know that is still the situation.""I honestly haven't considered whether I want it permanently. I feel like my job at the minute is to get Bournemouth as many points as I can in this period that I am here. I am fully focused on that.""The minute we came off the pitch, I just thought that we need to get ready for Brighton. Whether that is me or someone else, we just need to get some rest into them and go again.""A tactical change at the break against Forest, from a 4-2-3-1 formation to 5-2-3, did the trick for Bournemouth as Billing's thunderous 30-yard effort set them on the road to recovery, and Solanke's overhead kick was his 50th goal for the club in all competitions.The ex-Liverpool man played a huge part in the winner too, nicking the ball off McKenna before feeding Anthony to coolly convert.A 'disappointing day' for Forest - Steve CooperForest, meanwhile, suffered back-to-back defeats under Steve Cooper for the first time, having been thrashed 6-0 by champions Manchester City on Wednesday.Kouyate's first goal for the club and Johnson's penalty - given after a five-minute check by VAR and referee Michael Oliver on the pitchside monitor - gave them the perfect platform, but they crumbled thereafter.Club record signing Taiwo Awoniyi, one of 21 players signed by Forest in the summer transfer window, could have salvaged a point in injury time, but he screwed wide from eight yards out.Cooper said: ""I didn't see the second half coming. I thought we were very good in the first half, and good for the two-goal lead.""The first goal, we didn't defend well enough before the ball went in the net. That has then set the tone for the second half, and we've not managed that very well.""The second goal was from a set-piece. We should do better. Then there was a mistake from Scott [McKenna] for the third goal. That's the first time he's put a foot wrong since I've been here.""But let's not hide away from the fact that we've thrown away a win. We've not done it in a very good way. We've conceded three goals at home, and there's nothing good about that.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62697700
111,Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Fulham: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Harry Kane seal victory for Spurs,SAT 03 Sept 2022,premier-league,"Tottenham have lost only once in their last 16 Premier League gamesTottenham maintained their unbeaten start to the season as they beat Fulham with goals from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Harry Kane.A late strike from Fulham's star man Alexander Mitrovic made for a nervy final 10 minutes as Marco Silva's side suffered a second loss of the season.Spurs threatened to score virtually every time they came forward and had ample opportunity to extend their lead further, firing off 23 shots, 10 of which were on target.However, it was thanks to former Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno and a resolute Fulham defence that they were held to just two goals.Hojbjerg's slotted finish into the bottom corner after some nifty passing in Fulham's box opened the scoring, before Kane headed home to double their lead after 75 minutes.Fulham had been completely unable to get in the game for the majority of the 90 minutes with Mitrovic's threat nullified until his 83rd minute goal - his sixth of the season.Richarlison, making his first start for Spurs since joining from Everton in the summer, looked lively and had a goal chalked off for offside in the final minutes of the match.Deadline-day signings Willian and Dan James made their debuts for the Cottagers but struggled to impact the game.Antonio Conte not worried about goalless Son Heung-MinSpurs in control but still no joy for SonTottenham lacked cutting edge in their 1-1 draw against West Ham on Wednesday and, with so many chances missed against Fulham, it was feasible that the same scenario could play out again.They piled on the pressure in the first half with shots coming from all over the park, Son Heung-min smacked a shot off the bar, Richarlison had multiple chances to score his first Spurs goal.Son saw an early goal chalked off when Kane was deemed to be interfering with play after going for a header from an offside position, despite the South Korea international's looped cross finding the back of the net without his team-mate's efforts.But the form of last season's joint-Golden Boot winner Son will undoubtedly be becoming a concern for manager Antonio Conte - he has not scored with any of his 17 shots this season, four of which came against Fulham.He and Kane have linked up 41 times during their time at Spurs but the addition of Richarlison gives Conte another attacking option and allows him to be less reliant on that prolific partnership.That said, Spurs' defence were not really threatened until Mitrovic's late goal and Leno was called into action eight times, the most saves he has made in a Premier League game.Tottenham are undefeated in their last 12 Premier League games and have a 100% home record this season.Fulham, meanwhile, will see this as a small setback in a solid start to their return to the Premier League, but they will face a tricky task against more London opposition when they host Chelsea on Saturday, 10 September.Marco Silva bemoans 'sloppy' first half from Fulham",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62697704

It was not the cleanest of finishes but it came at a crucial time for the hosts, with Southampton finishing the half in the ascendency.Wolverhampton 1-0 Southampton: Saints 'deserved more' from game - Ralph HasenhuttlThe scrappy nature of the contest continued into the second period, but Southampton will be frustrated not to have earned a point after twice going close through Adams.The former Birmingham frontman made a meal of what should have been a straightforward finish when he nodded a looping ball against his own arm from point-blank range, leaving referee Brooks with an easy decision.Adams struck the woodwork with a firm header soon afterwards, but the visitors can have few complaints with the outcome after registering just one shot on target - a James Ward-Prowse free-kick easily saved by Sa.Wolves, meanwhile, were left to celebrate their first victory in the league since a 2-1 triumph over Aston Villa on 2 April - 154 days ago.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62697701

""He has the capabilities. He did it in a different league but this is the Premier League. He has to adapt mentally and physically, but he has the skills.""After Sancho's strike, United were able to do a containing job on a toothless Leicester side lacking in confidence and urgency and occasionally suffering the discontent of the increasingly impatient Foxes fans.United were happy to play on the counter and might have added another late on but there was always the feeling one goal was enough to claim the three points. And when there were moments of anxiety, the experienced £70m new boy Casemiro came on to steady the ship.""It is another step forward so I am happy with that,"" United boss Ten Hag told BT Sport.""We showed good team spirit. We had 11 players on the pitch who fought for each other and scored a lovely team goal.

115,Arsenal 2-1 Aston Villa: Gabriel Martinelli winner helps Gunners maintain 100% start,WED 31 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Gabriel Jesus has been on the winning side in 46 of the 49 Premier League games in which he has scored and has not lost in any of themArsenal maintained their 100% start to the season to stay top of the Premier League with a narrow victory over a lacklustre Aston Villa side.The result is likely to heap more pressure on Villa boss Steven Gerrard who has seen his side lose four of their first five fixtures. However, he could have few complaints here with his side struggling to match the hosts' intensity particularly in a one-sided first period.Gabriel Jesus' third goal of the season was a meagre reward for Arsenal's first-half dominance with the Brazilian forward sweeping a low effort past Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez after he had fumbled Granit Xhaka's deflected shot.And while Villa improved after the break and found an equaliser directly from Douglas Luiz's corner - as Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale protested that he was impeded by Boubacar Kamara - they were on level terms for less than three minutes. Mikel Arteta's side, who carried the greater threat throughout went straight back on the offensive and regained their lead with Gabriel Martinelli turning in Bukayo Saka's pinpoint cross.It means Arsenal have won their opening five league matches for the first time since the 2004-05 campaign, when they went on to finish second. Gerrard concerned about Villa futureFollow all Wednesday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Arsenal contentVisit our Aston Villa pageMikel Arteta reacts as Arsenal maintain perfect record with Villa winArsenal good value for victoryWhile Arsenal stuttered to a victory by the same scoreline against Fulham last weekend they more than merited their three points against Villa.Superior in all departments before the break, the Emirates crowd reacted with a mixture of relief and joy when Martinelli turned matchwinner with his fourth goal in his last six top-flight matches.Arteta's side had been given an early jolt by Emiliano Buendia's third-minute effort but from there on it was one-way traffic as the Gunners created a series of excellent chances which should have seen them out of sight by the break.Saka badly miscued to fire wide of an empty net from Martinelli's cross, while Odegaard saw his goal-bound shot blocked on the line by Villa defender Ezri Konsa and Matty Cash also prevented another touch off Saka from creeping over the line. Martinez, despite his error for Jesus' goal, excelled for the visitors and also made a fine save to tip Martinelli's superb volley over the bar, while centre-back Gabriel also twice went close. However, for all their free-flowing attacking, Arteta will likely have been most satisfied by the resolve that his side showed when they were pegged back. The Gunners will now travel to Manchester United on Sunday in buoyant mood, though Arteta's next challenge might be how he rotates his squad with the club's Europa League campaign set to begin next week at FC Zurich. Meanwhile, Villa will play host to champions Manchester City, who have scored 10 goals in their last two games, needing to quickly address the defensive frailties that saw Arsenal repeatedly carve them open to register 22 shots on goal.Detail of defending cost Villa - Steven Gerrard",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62655351

I said to the boys, 'what a chance to show resilience and togetherness at a difficult time.'""Bournemouth never seriously threatened to score during the opening 45 minutes and their revitalised play after re-emerging, when Solanke went close and Marcus Tavernier had an attempt blocked, was clearly the result of O'Neil urging them to show more ambition.The 39-year-old owed much of his relief to Wolves' familiar wastefulness.Jimenez, whose run of 11 games without a goal is the longest of his top-flight career, took a heavy touch after evading his markers in the best opportunity of the game, rolling his effort wide to leave his manager visibly frustrated.Kelly's quick reaction to thwart Podence came during a period of more than 30 minutes in which Bournemouth did not have an attempt on goal.Parker's exit was a shock and the squad he left behind delivered a commendably spirited display but it will have done little to ease supporters' concerns about their prospects of avoiding relegation.Wolves are in the bottom three and Lage looked bemused after another performance matching slick passing with bluntness in front of goal.The result means Bournemouth are the only side to have failed to find the net in four out of five Premier League games so far - and Wolves, who have scored just twice all season, must share their worries about where the next goal might come from.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62655358

It takes his overall tally for the season to nine.Joao Cancelo added a fourth when he drove home Bernardo Silva's fine pass across the penalty area before Haaland's strike partner Julian Alvarez took centre stage.On his full Premier League debut, the Argentine produced a fine finish to beat Dean Henderson after being set up by Riyad Mahrez.Then, after Kevin de Bruyne had nicked possession inside his own half and burst forward 50 yards, Alvarez picked his spot and finished high into the roof of the Forest net after Mahrez's shot had been deflected into his path.'He's the world's best' - can anyone stop Haaland?Nine in five for HaalandErling Haaland put Man City ahead after 12 minutesThere were not that many who felt Haaland would find it difficult adjusting to life in the Premier League, but there were some. They have already proved to be hopelessly wrong.It is impossible to know how this season will play out at such an early stage, but at the end of it, no-one will be saying the Norwegian is a bad fit.His movement may not be a fit for City's fluid style but his quickness of movement, intelligent running, strength and cool finishing make him a hugely dangerous threat.Haaland was having his shirt pulled as he advanced onto Phil Foden's curling cross for his opener. He was part of a fantastic one-touch passing move for the second which ended with the loose ball from a slide tackle on Foden presenting him with a tap-in. He shrugged opponents out of the way to make sure he was in the right place to head home John Stones' nod-back for his third.Guardiola spoke last season about adding someone to his squad who could sniff goals in the way Sergio Aguero used to.It is worth noting Aguero scored six goals in his first five games after joining City from Atletico Madrid in 2011.The real test starts now for ForestManchester City 6-0 Nottingham Forest: Mistakes were made but players will learn - CooperIf there is a positive from this for Forest, it is that they only have to try and stop Haaland once more at most in the league this season.The way their fans sang, both in support of their club and manager Steve Cooper, even deep into the second-half when the gap turned into a chasm, suggested they had not travelled from the East Midlands with any realistic hope of their first top flight away win at City since 1989, when Mikhail Gorbachev was President of the Soviet Union.They did have one decent chance, for debutant Renan Lodi, who found space at the far post but not the net as he tried to guide his header past Ederson.Cooper has repeated the club's startling summer recruitment drive, which could reach 20 before Thursday evening's transfer deadline, was necessary due to the number of last season's squad that had left and the increase in quality required to compete in the Premier League.After collecting an acceptable four points from five games as the squad was pieced together, games against Bournemouth, Leeds and Fulham next month will provide more concrete evidence about whether the battle in their first top flight campaign in over two decades will be for respectability or survival.Go straight to all the best Manchester City contentVisit our Nottingham Forest pageAll Wednesday's Premier League action live",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62655348

I can tell only that the referee has taken the right decision. Usually the VAR calls when the call is not right.""The visitors did break the deadlock in the first half through Thilo Kehrer's own goal - the German sliding in and diverting the ball into his own net following Harry Kane's low cross.Michail Antonio curled a delightful strike against the post before West Ham deservedly levelled in the second half courtesy of Tomas Soucek, the Czech confidently converting from Antonio's clever flicked pass.Club record signing Lucas Paqueta was introduced for his Hammers debut after the hour mark despite not having trained with David Moyes' men since signing from Lyon.The best opportunity for a winner fell to Pablo Fornals but the Spaniard flashed his first-time shot over from 12 yards, while at the other end Kane's scuffed volley was gathered by Lukasz Fabianski.Relive Wednesday's Premier League actionConte's men lack cutting edgeSpurs have enjoyed a decent start to the new season but it will be games like this which they feel they should be winning to be considered genuine title challengers.Though they took a fortuitous the lead in this London derby aided by Kehrer's own goal, they were pegged back by the hosts and were unable to find a way to grab all three points.Emerson Royal's long-range drive and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's low drilled effort were both kept out by Fabianski.The most controversial moment of the contest came in the opening period when Bankes awarded a spot-kick after the ball hit Cresswell's outstretched arm.But after a check which lasted more than three minutes, the officials ruled that it had come off the full-back's head before bouncing on to his arm and the decision was overturned.Conte said: ""In England they have to learn much more to use the VAR in the right way. You have to study very well and be more accurate.""If there is VAR, you have to utilise it in the right way or accept the decision of the referee. If you have a TV then you have time to see. It is difficult not only for me but every coach.""Spurs were unable to push on after taking the lead and the form of front man Son Heung-min will be a worry. The South Korean is yet to score this season and saw a shot deflect wide in the second period.Summer signing Richarlison came on with 15 minutes remaining, but the Brazilian struggled to make an impact in his limited time on the pitch.West Ham pegged their opponents back through Soucek's well-taken goal after a crafty pass from Antonio, making his 200th league appearance for the Hammers.Jarrod Bowen, yet to net in the league this term, could have won it in injury time but his volley on the stretch went agonisingly wide of the far post.West Ham move up to 14th but have made an inconsistent start, with three consecutive defeats followed the weekend victory over Aston Villa.West Ham 1-1 Tottenham: Spurs made it tough for us - David Moyes",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62655354

Once Zaha had opened the scoring with his fourth goal of the season - and sixth in seven home league games - they appeared to be heading towards a second league win of the campaign.Olise was unfortunate to see his effort hit the frame of the goal, while Brentford's first strike on target - a Josh Dasilva shot easily held by Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita - came with just 20 minutes remaining.But the Bees kept pushing and snatched an equaliser when Wissa - left completely unmarked in the Palace box - beat Guaita with a firm, well-placed header from Janelt's fine delivery.Thomas Frank's side then very nearly claimed an unlikely victory as Rico Henry was thwarted by Guaita, before Mee's header thudded against the woodwork.Palace brought in four players - Doucoure, Sam Johnstone, Malcolm Ebiowei, and Chris Richards - this summer but Vieira, who took charge of Palace for the 50th time on Tuesday night, says they need more signings before the transfer window closes on Thursday.The Frenchman, though, has refused to comment on rumours Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is set to re-join the club following his successful loan spell at Selhurst Park last term.Crystal Palace 1-1 Brentford: Thomas Frank rues Brentford's missed chances",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62641728

From then on Southampton were the better side and scored what proved to be the winner before the break, when Romain Perraud picked out Adam Armstrong and his effort deflected off Kalidou Koulibaly and into the net.Ralph Hasenhuttl's outfit climb to seventh as a result of the deserved victory, level on seven points with Chelsea but above them on goals scored. 'Soft, soft, soft' Blues need to toughen up - TuchelReaction to Tuesday's Premier League actionVisit our Southampton pageGo straight to all the best Chelsea contentSaints' summer signings prove a hitRalph Hasenhuttl his side's 'perfect performance' as Southampton shock ChelseaSouthampton are so often a breeding ground for young players looking for a break in the top flight and appear to have recruited another gem in Lavia, who spent two years at City after leaving Anderlecht, before joining the Saints this summer.The midfielder and 20-year-old German defender Armel Bella-Kotchap, another shrewd acquisition, provided the foundations for an impressive Southampton performance that earned them a first win over Chelsea in three years and first at St Mary's since March 2013.Chelsea had been the better side early on and capitalised through Sterling, but a slight mix up saw Cesar Azpilicueta put the ball behind for a corner and it was only cleared as far as Lavia - the 18-year-old Belgian took a touch before rifling a strike past Mendy from the edge of the area.The hosts were outdone in terms of possession in the first half but looked far more efficient with the ball after Lavia's leveller and a swift move led to Armstrong putting them ahead in added time from Perraud's cutback. That Lavia - the first player born in 2004 to score a Premier League goal - had to be replaced just before the hour mark after pulling up will be a concern for Hasenhuttl, with the youngster already proving to be an integral part of his side.""It will not be the last one coming here and showing up,"" said Hasenhuttl of Southampton's recruitment of young, promising players.He added: ""I said it from the first day that we have the feeling that we have a team that is young but there is a lot of empty space on the hard disk and they can learn.""They have fun working hard, they have fun running a lot and, when the moment comes, they have fun scoring goals.""Bella-Kotchap, who made a great recovery tackle on Sterling early in the game, and Mohammed Salisu were formidable at the heart of Southampton's defence and gave Chelsea little encouragement of finding a way back.At the other end, Marc Cucurella stopped Southampton adding to their lead with an instinctive block from Mohamed Elyounoussi's header and Thiago Silva then cleared a Salisu effort off the line as the hosts continued their encouraging start to the campaign.Blunted Blues 'pushed off balance' Raheem Sterling scored his third goal of the season for ChelseaTuchel spoke of having a depleted squad before this fixture but also admitted he will be happy to have ""no more distractions"" once the window closes on Thursday.A combination of suspensions, injuries and players either departing or yet to arrive means the German boss has been left short in certain areas and he started with Hakim Ziyech, someone heavily linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge.Chelsea too easy to beat - TuchelThe visitors started brightly and when Sterling showed composure to put them ahead it looked as if Chelsea may be coasting to a second successive victory.But Tuchel says his side only played for ""20 to 25 minutes"" and once the door was open for Southampton the visitors struggled to create clear-cut chances.They lacked fluidity and urgency in attack, bringing on Armando Broja - a player on loan at Southampton last season - to try and add a focal point up top.The 20-year-old striker had a header tipped wide by Saints goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu and Kai Havertz also nodded over when well placed, but Tuchel said his side were too easily ""pushed off balance"" by their opponents.As the expected signing of Leicester defender Wesley Fofana tips the Blues' summer spending beyond £200m before the deadline, there will be pressure on the German boss to make things click sooner rather than later.

123,Leeds United 1-1 Everton: Luis Sinisterra scores first Premier League goal for Whites,TUE 30 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Luis Sinisterra joined Leeds in the summer from FeyenoordLuis Sinisterra scored his first Premier League goal for Leeds as they came from a goal behind to draw with Everton in a pulsating encounter at Elland Road. The Colombian winger, who hit his first goal for the club in the EFL Cup last week following a summer move from Feyenoord, drove in from 18 yards after the break as Leeds piled pressure on Everton.They were much improved after a poor first half when Anthony Gordon scored for a second successive game, keeping his cool to slip the ball through Illan Meslier's legs following Alex Iwobi's through ball. Leeds' top scorer Rodrigo also went off with what Jesse Marsch confirmed afterwards was a dislocated shoulder following an innocuous challenge with Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. But inspired by the impressive Jack Harrison and substitute Joe Gelhardt, Leeds tore into their opponents only to find Pickford in top form, denying both players and Brenden Aaronson. As the game opened up, Everton had late chances to win it through Amadou Onana and Nathan Patterson.  But with Leeds adding further pressure Everton's backline stayed firm, although the result leaves the Toffees searching for their first win of the season under Frank Lampard. Gordon transfer deadline has passed - LampardLeeds turn on style in second halfLeeds 1-1 Everton: Jesse Marsch frustrated with Toffees approachLeeds' second-half recovery came after a first period where they showed plenty of effort but found Everton's new-look defence too tough to breach. The injury to Rodrigo also knocked their confidence, with the Spanish international leaving the pitch in some discomfort after a shoulder charge with Pickford. Marsch added: ""They popped it back in and seems to be ok. He will have a scan.""The Leeds striker had their best chance of the first half when he was inches away from connecting with a Harrison cross early on, but it was only after the break that the hosts began to test Pickford. First, Aaronson drew a fine stop from the Everton goalkeeper before Harrison had another effort saved. But the England number one could do little about Sinisterra's effort from the edge of the box. Elland Road erupted at that point, and it threatened to spill over as Gordon and Rasmus Kristensen put their heads together shortly afterwards, leading to a yellow card each, and the two benches clashed too. At times, it felt like a throwback to another era, but the football was thrilling even if Patrick Bamford's return from injury could not conjure a winner. Despite the feeling of disappointment at the end, Leeds recovered from their first defeat of the season at Brighton on Saturday to show they mean business under Marsch with the point keeping them fifth in the table. Everton lack punch up front as Maupay misses out Leeds 1-1 Everton: Frank Lampard delighted with players efforts in new systemAlthough Lampard will be disappointed his side could not take advantage of their own chances late on, with Patterson clean through on goal but denied by Meslier, his side showed enough defensive prowess to merit a point. Gordon, who has been the subject of at least one rejected £45m bid from Chelsea during the transfer window, showed his composure and why Lampard is keen to hold onto the England under-21 international. But a third draw of the season was also credit to a new-look defence who were well marshalled by the new centre-back pairing of Conor Coady and James Tarkowski. They were also protected well by summer signing Onana, who looked impressive at the base of midfield. That part of Lampard's side was much improved on last season, but where they struggled again was in scoring goals, even if Demarai Gray had the ball in the net only to be denied by a marginal offside decision, which was confirmed by the video assistant referee.With Dominic Calvert-Lewin still injured, the arrival of Neal Maupay from Brighton on Friday was supposed to help that cause, but he frustratingly sat on the bench because Everton had missed the midday deadline in order for him to play.

First Saint-Maximin brought a fine save from Sa with a powerful shot, then substitute Elliot Anderson hit the bar with a far-post header after Raul Jimenez flicked a cross into the youngster's path. The result was a massive blow for Wolves, who thought they had made it 2-0 nine minutes from time, only for Jimenez's close-range finish to be ruled out after a VAR intervention for a foul in the build-up.Wolves were also angry Newcastle defender Fabian Schar was only shown a yellow card instead of red, following a VAR check, for a studs-up challenge on Pedro Neto early in the second half.Lage says Boly failed to report for Newcastle drawNeves incredulous as Schar avoids red card for Neto challengeSensational Saint-MaximinThis was not a point won by Newcastle in the same thrilling manner as last week against Manchester City. But it said so much about the character Eddie Howe has instilled in his squad.Even without new signing Alexander Isak - whose work permit is still to be processed, Callum Wilson and Bruno Guimaraes - both influential figures in last week's six-goal thriller against the champions - Newcastle still found a way to get something out of a game they struggled to influence for the first hour.Joe Willock was too slow to close down Neves for the Wolves opener and the visitors were passive in midfield.Yet they never let their heads drop and did not allow themselves to be overwhelmed in the way Newcastle teams of the past might have been.And, in Saint-Maximin, they have a player capable of moments of genius.Wolves boss Bruno Lage will lament Hwang's poor clearance, but the home defence had thrown their bodies in front of so many half-chances, there seemed little likelihood of the Korean being punished when the ball fell to the French forward.Sa barely moved before the ball whistled past him into the corner - Saint-Maximin's first goal of the season being well worth the wait.The result means Newcastle are unbeaten in their first four games for the first time since 2012.Howe praises Saint-Maximin's 'truly incredible' finishNeves leads by exampleThis was another example of Wolves failing to make the most of their overall performance.At least they managed to score, after a wait of 302 minutes since their only other league goal of the season, by Daniel Podence on the opening day at Leeds.And they were led superbly by Neves.The Portugal midfielder was the automatic choice to replace Conor Coady as captain given he skippered Porto in the Champions League when he was just 18 and is one of the few remaining members of Nuno Espirito Santo's Championship-winning squad.Neves is not as vocal as Coady - hardly anyone is in fairness - but still has a massive influence on the squad.The 60-yard cross-field pass from inside his own half that allowed Goncalo Guedes the chance to create a decent early opportunity for the lively Neto was sensational, given it was delivered as Neves was moving pretty quickly himself.And if Newcastle were not ready for Neves' 38th-minute goal, they should have been.Exactly half of Neves' 16 Premier League goals have come from outside the penalty area, including four of his past five.The sight of him scrapping for possession inside the Newcastle half, when the game remained in the balance, epitomised the midfielder's industrious approach.Sadly for him, and his team, Saint-Maximin's brilliance ensured it did not bring the victory that, for so long, looked likely.I'm very proud of what Wolves did - LageFollow live updates and radio from Premier LeagueVisit our Wolves pageGo straight to all the best Newcastle content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62621480

The summer arrivals distinguished themselves, with keeper Bazunu looking secure, defender Bella-Kotchap making several crucial interventions, 18-year-old Romeo Lavia looking a real find in midfield and Aribo a stand-out performer.Hasenhuttl will feel he has something to work with here and if the response of their fans at the conclusion is anything to go by, so do Southampton's supporters.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62614445

That allowed Leicester back into the game and they had the ball in the net before the break, but Daniel Amartey's effort was ruled out with Harvey Barnes harshly adjudged to have fouled goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.Barnes did get his goal following a neat one-two with Jamie Vardy, but only after the Foxes were two goals down.Vardy twice went close and Ayoze Perez struck the bar as the visitors pressed for a late leveller that never came, meaning Brendan Rodgers' side have now lost three games in a row since an opening-day draw with Brentford. ""The goals were crucial because they gave us belief and the boost that it was possible,"" Tuchel said of Sterling. ""They were responsible for the win.""It was needed. We need him to score, it's what he does and he will score. I could feel he wasn't happy - he wants to score more and have more chances.""We played in a more aggressive shape in the first half for 25 minutes and then we are a man down, so we needed him to step up - he did, and he did what he always does. He will score, I'm convinced, and he will create chances.""Follow Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Chelsea contentVisit our Leicester City pageSterling inspires Chelsea win Thomas Tuchel praises Thiago Silva's performance as 10-men Chelsea edge LeicesterTuchel had to watch this match from the stands after his sending-off in the tussle that followed the draw with Tottenham, but said before this fixture he is ""enjoying the challenge"" of building a new side. He will have definitely enjoyed seeing one of his new arrivals earn Chelsea their first win at Stamford Bridge this season.Sterling was influential and put the hosts in front with a curling effort that took a deflection off Amartey to beat a despairing Danny Ward in the Leicester goal.The former Manchester City winger struck a post moments later from a Marc Cucurella pass - another summer purchase - but the 27-year-old did not have to wait long for his second Blues goal, arriving to tap in a delicious low cross from the right from James, who earlier struck the outside of a post with a thumping half volley.Sterling also teed up Ruben Loftus-Cheek early on but the midfielder was denied by Ward when he really should have put the hosts in front. Youri Tielemans then hauled Loftus-Cheek down in the box and Sterling was waiting to take the spot-kick only for VAR to rule Kai Havertz offside by the narrowest of margins. All this came amid a chaotic few moments for Gallagher, who, having been booked in the 22nd minute, needlessly dived in on Harvey Barnes to stop a Foxes break and was shown a red card - Chelsea's third in as many games. The Blues were without boss Tuchel and defender Kalidou Koulibaly following his red card against Leeds, and believe the answer to any defensive issues is a talented young centre-back currently training with their opponents' under-23s.Reports suggesting a deal of about £70m for Wesley Fofana has been agreed dominated the build-up to this game, and the 21-year-old Frenchman was not named in the Leicester squad because of personal reasons, with Rodgers saying he trained elsewhere this week. However, neither boss would be drawn on the potential transfer after the game.And while Fofana may be the future of the Blues' defence, Thiago Silva showed they can still rely on their experienced campaigners as the 37-year-old helped the 10 men survive wave after wave of late pressure.Worrying times for LeicesterChelsea 2-1 Leicester: Brendan Rodgers Foxes ""lacked agression"" in loss to 10-man ChelseaRodgers has insisted he is not feeling the pressure despite Leicester's poor start but he has now lost three successive games for the first time in eight years and the Foxes are without a top-flight win in their opening four for the first time since 2003.The Leicester boss may have felt hard done by when Amartey's effort was ruled out for a foul by Barnes on Mendy with the game goalless, but the visitors then found themselves 2-0 down despite their numerical advantage. Fofana's impending exit may mean Leicester belatedly spend some money this window - goalkeeper Alex Smithies on a free transfer the only arrival so far - with Rodgers' outfit looking in need of reinforcements.

131,"Liverpool 9-0 Bournemouth: Diaz, Elliott, Alexander-Arnold, Firmino, Van Dijk all score",SAT 27 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Harvey Elliott curled in his first Premier League goal for LiverpoolLiverpool equalled the biggest victory in Premier League history as they kick-started their season in spectacular fashion by thrashing newly promoted Bournemouth at Anfield.Manager Jurgen Klopp had described the beginning to his side's campaign as a ""false start"" after two draws and Monday night's defeat at Manchester United, but the Reds responded in emphatic fashion.Manchester United have achieved this margin of victory twice - against Ipswich in 1995 and Southampton last year - while Leicester City did likewise against the Saints in 2019.Liverpool got off to the perfect start as two goals in the opening five minutes against the Cherries set a raucous Anfield rocking. Luis Diaz rose to powerfully head home the opener and the impressive Harvey Elliott curled in his first top-flight goal with a sublime strike from outside the box.Full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold thumped a long-range shot into the top corner, with all three goals assisted by Roberto Firmino.The Brazil forward went from provider to scorer on the half-hour mark when he acrobatically converted from inside the six-yard box and Virgil van Dijk headed in the fifth from a corner - all before half-time.It went from bad to worse for Scott Parker's men in the first minute of the second half when Chris Mepham stretched to divert the ball into his own net and Firmino poked home the seventh of the afternoon after a fortunate deflection.Summer signing Fabio Carvalho volleyed in with eight minutes left for number eight and Colombia winger Diaz headed in the ninth to complete an incredible, historic win.For Bournemouth, the rout was their third consecutive league defeat without scoring a goal after beating Aston Villa in their opening game.It was really not cool to play against us - KloppRampant Reds respond in styleIt had been suggested Liverpool have looked lethargic - and that they are missing forward Sadio Mane, now at Bayern Munich - after failing to win any of their opening three games.Draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace being followed by a sluggish showing in the 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford at the start of the week led to questions being raised about the title credentials of a Reds side that ended last season on low points in the league and Champions League.An extensive injury list - notably in midfield - and big summer signing Darwin Nunez being suspended has not helped, but Liverpool responded to the doubters with a breathtaking showing to which the visitors had no reply.The Reds had a total of 19 shots at goal, 12 of which were on target - with a record-equalling nine ending up in the back of the net.It was the first time they had racked up that number since 1989, when they did so against Crystal Palace in the old First Division.Klopp's side had conceded the first goal in their last seven Premier League games but Diaz set them on their way after just two minutes with a sweet header.The goal will have relieved some tension for what would have been a nervous crowd after the side's modest start to the season.Teenager Elliott has featured in all four league games this season and opened his league account for the Reds with a delightful curling effort into the bottom corner before Alexander-Arnold smashed into the corner from outside the box.A 9-0 scoreline has been seen just four times in the Premier LeagueFirmino ended a barren run of 20 league games with a league goal at Anfield with an opportunistic strike, while Van Dijk shrugged off a difficult game at Manchester United by heading in the fifth.Chris Mepham's own goal, Firmino's second and Carvalho's first for the club made it a perfect afternoon for the Reds as they narrowly missed out on claiming the Premier League's biggest victory.Liverpool should really have hit double figures in a completely one-side game as Mohamed Salah endured a rare off day in a game in which his team-mates were ruthless.The Egypt forward missed an open net from a couple of yards out then had a shot tipped over by Mark Travers before blazing over from close range. Left-back Andrew Robertson also headed over from in front of goal.The emphatic win maintained Liverpool's dominant run over sides promoted from the Championship, and they have now lost just one of 34 meetings against newly promoted teams.Parker 'shell-shocked' after 9-0 defeat by LiverpoolCherries both goal-shy and leakyBournemouth had enjoyed a pleasant initial return to the Premier League when they beat Aston Villa on the opening weekend, but it has proved to be a false dawn and the remainder of August has been miserable.The south coast side were hammered 4-0 by champions Manchester City, lost 3-0 at home to Arsenal and totally capitulated after conceding twice in the opening five minutes at Anfield.Parker's men have conceded the most goals in the top flight this season (16) and at the other end have netted just twice.Their total of 21 shots from their opening four games is the second fewest since Sunderland had 20 in 2012-13.Home goalkeeper Alisson had a comfortable afternoon in the Merseyside sun, plucking a weak Kieffer Moore header out of the air being the most that he was stretched all game.Reaction from all of Saturday's action",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62614438

The Norwegian nodded in Phil Foden's cross to draw Pep Guardiola's side level, then prodded in Stones' wayward shot to complete the turnaround. With Palace chasing the game, Haaland rounded off the scoring, racing on to Ilkay Gundogan's pass and holding off Joel Ward to cap a fine performance, before being replaced to a rapturous ovation from the home fans.The win sees City finish the day second in the Premier League table, two points behind Arsenal who beat Fulham in the late kick-off, while Palace are 13th with four points from four games.Follow all Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Manchester City contentVisit our Crystal Palace pageHaaland 'has the sense to score goals' - Pep GuardiolaA tale of two halvesWhile City's supporters celebrated at full-time, Patrick Vieira and his Palace players were left to reflect on what might have been after a gutsy first-half display brimming with organisation, stout defending and some excellent counter-attacking. Eberechi Eze caught the eye for the visitors and produced two wonderful deliveries from which they capitalised on slack City defending. His fourth-minute cross from the right flew through a posse of players before cannoning off the unfortunate Stones, while his corner from the same side saw Andersen have an unopposed header above Haaland which he powered home. While far from immediate, City went more direct and produced the sort of stirring response that saw them come from a similar position to claim a point at Newcastle.Silva's effort proved the catalyst for their recovery. The Portugal midfielder was excellent throughout and while there was an element of good fortune about his goal there was a sense of inevitability about it.Wave after wave of attacks followed and Haaland, who had been well shackled up until then by Marc Guehi and Andersen, came to the fore.Six of his seven efforts on goal came after the break, with his return of three goals a rich reward for a player showing little sign of needing to adapt to the demands of a new manager or country and quickly establishing himself as one of the top-flight's most feared forwards. Only Diego Costa, with seven goals, has enjoyed a better goalscoring return in his first four Premier League games than the former Borussia Dortmund striker.Should he maintain his efficiency in front of goal, Haaland's ability to swing tight contests in City's favour is likely to prove an invaluable commodity in the title race.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62614443
133,Arsenal 2-1 Fulham: Gabriel redeems himself with winner,SAT 27 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Arsenal sit two points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League tableGabriel made up for a horrible error to score the winner against Fulham and maintain leaders Arsenal's winning start to the Premier League season. The defender lost possession on the edge of his own box to allow Aleksandar Mitrovic to put Fulham ahead.But after Martin Odegaard equalised with a deflected strike, Gabriel redeemed himself with a scrambled finish from close range in the 85th minute.Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale then made a crucial save to deny Fulham's Nathaniel Chalobah an equaliser in added time.Victory ensured Arsenal kept up their 100% start to the season and stayed top of the table, despite being frustrated for large parts by the visitors. Mikel Arteta's side controlled possession and had numerous chances, with Odegaard, Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus all coming close before Mitrovic stunned the Gunners with the opener. Substitute Eddie Nketiah added much-needed energy for Arsenal when he was introduced shortly after Arteta's side fell behind and after the impressive Odegaard's equaliser, Gabriel thumped the ball home after a scramble following a corner. The result ends Fulham's impressive unbeaten start to their return to the top flight while Arsenal strengthen their credentials as a growing force under Arteta.Reaction to Saturday's Premier League Arsenal 2-1 Fulham: Mikel Arteta praises Gunners' 'mentality'Gabriel plays villain and heroThe cost of Gabriel's mistake could have been a heavy one, with Arsenal appearing poised to fall behind Manchester City on goal difference in the table if they had dropped two points against the Cottagers. They needed some fortune to get over the line as well as a smart stop from Ramsdale in added time to push Chalobah's effort away from goal. Odegaard was rewarded for his endeavour and creativity as his curling effort took a wicked deflection nine minutes after Gabriel's mistake - and that gave Arsenal the impetus to drive forward in search of the three points. However, as chances continued to fall away from Arsenal players, there was a growing feeling they would drop points for the first time this season.Gabriel, who pulled his shirt over his head seconds after the Serbia striker slotted the opener, was the most determined as the ball dropped in front of goal and he forced the ball home. It was the perfect way to mark Arteta's 100th Premier League game in charge and Arsenal will seek to end August with five wins out of five when they host inconsistent Aston Villa on the final day of the month. For Fulham, it was a disappointing result but another encouraging performance, follow their opening-weekend draw with Liverpool, and Marco Silva's side look at home in this company.

135,Leeds 3-0 Chelsea: Hosts dominate at Elland Road to continue unbeaten start,SUN 21 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Rodrigo scored his fourth of the season, making him the Premier League's top scorerLeeds continued their unbeaten start to the season as they secured a famous win over Chelsea's new-look team with a display which will cause Thomas Tuchel nightmares. Chelsea, who spent more than £170m on players over the summer, were the architects of their own downfall in the first half. Edouard Mendy gifted Leeds the opener by miscontrolling a backpass, allowing Brenden Aaronson to pounce. Four minutes later Raheem Sterling gave away a free-kick on the edge of the box, from which Rodrigo scored his fourth of the season after Jack Harrison's delivery. But Leeds also out-fought their opponents, particularly in midfield, in echoes of the famous historical battles between the two rivals. And they sealed a first Premier League win over Chelsea in seven attempts, dating back to 2002, when Harrison scored after Daniel James' cross was touched to him by Rodrigo. An already raucous Elland Road was in disbelief at that moment; the home fans taunted their Chelsea counterparts and manager Jesse Marsch punched the air in wild joy. There were chances for the visitors. Sterling curled wide in the first minute and had a goal disallowed, while Marc Cucurella, signed for £62m, was also off-target twice. But when Kalidou Koulibaly was sent off six minutes from time for a second booking, it summed up Chelsea's afternoon, allowing Leeds fans to wallow in the elation of a superb start to the season as their team moved into second place in the table. Leeds 3-0 Chelsea: Jesse Marsch Marsch praises 'relentless'  Brenden AaronsonA stunning result to win over Marsch scepticsHaving secured their Premier League survival on the final day of last season and lost both Kalvin Phillips and Raphinha to Manchester City and Barcelona over the summer, Leeds' story was expected to be one of how they would cope. But with boss Marsch making several key signings, there was a spirit and team ethic in Leeds which Chelsea could not match. They were helped too by a crowd which was already deafening before kick-off and only increased in volume as the visitors fell apart. After a positive start, which saw Tyler Adams get the upper hand in midfield on Conor Gallagher, who was making his full Chelsea debut, the atmosphere took off in the 33rd minute following Mendy's error. Aaronson, who was signed from RB Salzburg in the summer, had already shown his endeavour in midfield and the American chased down Thiago Silva's backpass to open his Leeds account in the easiest fashion possible once keeper Mendy lost the ball a yard from the goal. Four minutes later Elland Road was in disbelief and Marsch was charging down the touchline. Harrison's set-piece caused problems once again and Rodrigo doubled United's lead to become the Premier League's top scorer with four goals this season. The second half was mostly about containment as Chelsea searched for an equaliser. But Leeds' defence was equal to the task, with a third goal allowing fans to enjoy a brilliant day in the Yorkshire sunshine. There are bound to be difficult days to come over the season, but this will give Marsch sceptics plenty to consider - and the American lapped up the applause from all four sides of the stadium with fans singing his name. Leeds 3-0 Chelsea: Tuchel says Chelsea 'were better team' despite defeatDo Chelsea need more signings? Chelsea might have been disappointed to have left their latest battle with Tottenham with only a point last Sunday but many fans were encouraged by the performance. This was a complete contrast because they contributed to their own demise, were outmuscled in midfield and failed to find cohesion up front despite their vast array of attacking talent. Manager Tuchel, who is already facing a touchline ban after the Spurs match, could not contain his frustration with both his team and Marsch at times on the touchline. The first-half display was summed up by £50m signing Sterling. He was bought to be a leader, but he missed a great chance in the first minute and his demeanour seemed to be affected by a disallowed goal in similar circumstances after 15 minutes. And after he was booked for a silly foul, which led to Rodrigo's goal, he did not really feature. But in truth there were problems all over the pitch, and there will be concerns from the new owners and Tuchel about a performance which might need addressing with further signings. Mendy, who has been a solid performer since he signed for Chelsea, made an uncharacteristic error for the opener, but the wider concern will be about Chelsea's midfield. Gallagher struggled alongside Jorginho and it further exposed an area of the field in which the Blues were missing injured duo N'Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic. Both midfield starters were replaced after an hour, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek moving inside and Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic being introduced. But other than Reece James having a shot saved by Illan Meslier, Chelsea failed to carve out many clear-cut openings as their attack faltered. It left Tuchel cursing in the dugout and Koulibaly completed a miserable afternoon when he was shown a second yellow card for pulling back Joe Gelhardt.

Pope saved with his legs to deny Haaland and Phil Foden and kept out an effort from De Bruyne as the visitors piled on the pressure.Newcastle started to get back in the game and Saint-Maximin had an effort parried by Ederson with Wilson also unable to convert a chance as he lost his balance.But it became 1-1 in the 28th minute as Saint-Maximin crossed from the left and Almiron, who had earlier wasted an opportunity by firing over, flung himself at the ball, which bounced off his thigh and into the net.It had originally been ruled out for offside but a VAR check showed Joao Cancelo and Kyle Walker had played him onside - to the delight of Almiron, who celebrated his first goal of the season.Miguel Almiron's goal was his first for Newcastle this seasonIt would have been a satisfying moment for him as he had been recently mocked by City's Jack Grealish, absent at St James' Park after picking up a knock in the 4-0 win over Bournemouth eight days ago.During City's title celebrations in May, the England forward joked Riyad Mahrez had played 'like Almiron' in their final-day victory over Aston Villa, but the Paraguayan silenced his critic in the best way possible.Newcastle scored again just before half time when Saint-Maximin played a ball into Wilson, who produced an excellent first touch to evade both Ruben Dias and John Stones before putting his side ahead.City, facing their first away league defeat since 15 August 2021 when they lost 1-0 at Tottenham, fell further behind with Trippier's excellent free-kick.Newcastle 3-3 Man City: Citizens showed who they are - GuardiolaNewcastle unable to hold on to two-goal leadBut with the home fans ecstatic at their side's advantage, City showed why they have been English champions in four of the past five seasons, producing an excellent recovery.Haaland had faced criticism after only having eight touches in the 4-0 win over Bournemouth, although he did register an assist.But the Norway striker grabbed his third league goal since his £51.2m move from Borussia Dortmund in June with a predator's finish from close range, reacting quickest to convert Rodri's pullback.Silva then calmly finished from De Bruyne's pass to leave it at 3-3 with 26 minutes to go and set up a thrilling finale - in which Trippier feared he had been dismissed, only to be reprieved.Neither side could find a winner as a frantic afternoon ended in a draw with both teams maintaining their unbeaten league starts, with City second on seven points, two more than sixth-placed Newcastle.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62537744

Kane's effort also saw the hosts become the fifth team to score 1,000 goals at home since the Premier League was formed in 1992. The goal had been coming with both the 29-year-old and his strike partner Son Heung-min hitting the woodwork as Spurs poured forward to break the deadlock.The intensity of their football was in complete contrast to the first period, when a Wolves team containing seven Portuguese players - the joint-most from a single foreign nation in a starting XI in the competition - were in the ascendancy. Bruno Lage's side restricted the hosts to just one 45th-minute effort and were unfortunate to see record signing Matheus Nunes nod Ruben Neves' probing pass inches wide of the Spurs goal.However, despite the promise of Nunes' display and the neat and tidy football which saw them develop several good openings, Wolves lacked a spark in the final third as their winless top-flight run reached 10 matches.Tottenham 1-0 Wolves: Bruno Lage 'proud' of Wolves despite loss at SpursKane comes to the fore for SpursHaving had to wait until mid-October for his first Premier League goal last term, Kane has now scored crucial goals in two of Tottenham's first three fixtures in a month that he has historically struggled in.His last-gasp equaliser at Stamford Bridge helped Antonio Conte's side maintain their unbeaten start at Chelsea, while against Wolves he delivered a match-winning contribution. On the balance of play it was not unmerited, though it relied upon Kane's persistence and capacity to immediately brush off one missed opportunity and search for another. Having registered Tottenham's only first-half attempt at goal with a looping header, Kane cannoned a header against the Wolves bar in the second period before brilliantly escaping the attention of Nathan Collins to nod home from two yardsHad Wolves had a player of his ilk at the other end of the pitch, the score may have arguably been reversed. The likes of Daniel Podence and another new signing Goncalo Guedes both worked themselves into positions where Kane would have likely profited.Meanwhile, Raul Jimenez looked short of match sharpness when appearing as a substitute on his return from a pre-season injury and Lage will hope to get the Mexican up to speed quickly, with no side outside the bottom three scoring fewer goals than Wolves last term.Follow all Saturday's Premier League actionVisit our Tottenham pageGo straight to the best Wolves content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62529371

Villa got off to the perfect start when Ollie Watkins fired low past Vicente Guaita to give the visitors a fifth-minute lead. But Palace restored parity on the counter less than three minutes later through the impressive Zaha, who shook off Ezri Konsa and beat Emiliano Martinez with a low shot. The hosts thought they had turned the game on its head when Jeffrey Schlupp struck after 26 minutes only for VAR to adjudge that Odsonne Edouard had strayed offside before finding the Ghana midfielder.However, VAR later awarded Palace a penalty after Marc Guehi's back-post header struck Lucas Digne's arm, with Zaha scoring on the rebound having seen his spot-kick saved by Martinez.Substitute Jean-Philippe Mateta wrapped up the win for Palace with a well-taken strike - only a minute after replacing Edouard.""Today, we had a really good performance,"" said Palace boss Patrick Vieira.

Crystal Palace 3-1 Aston Villa: No common sense in VAR decision - Steven GerrardThe hosts pushed for a second before the break but were frustrated as Schlupp misjudged a free header before being denied by VAR, while Edouard's appeal for a penalty was turned down following a tussle with Mings.Zaha then weaved his way around a couple of Villa defenders before pulling a cross back to Jordan Ayew, whose first-time shot was pushed away by Martinez. While Bailey struck the crossbar for Villa with a curling effort six minutes after the break, Palace profited from a lengthy VAR check after Guehi's header struck Digne's arm. Martinez beat away Zaha's effort from the spot but the Ivorian was on hand to lash home the rebound and was also involved in Palace's third, playing Tyrick Mitchell in down the left, enabling the England full-back to cross for Mateta to condemn Villa to a second successive defeat on the road.Zaha's double takes the 29-year-old to 12 Premier League goals for 2022, matching Luka Milivojevic's club record for most goals in a calendar year. ""For me, it's harsh,"" Gerrard said of the penalty.""I'm not sure what Lucas can do in the situation.

With Richarlison sold to Tottenham Hotspur and Dominic Calvert-Lewin not yet fit, Salomon Rondon is the Toffees' only available centre forward.The Venezuelan has hardly been prolific in England but the hosts looked better for moving Gordon on to the flank to use Rondon as a focal point in attack.The experienced striker turned his marker and fired wide in the second half in his most threatening moment but it was Gray who looked most dangerous, delivering a series of inviting free-kicks in the first half that were not capitalised on.Midfielder Tom Davies latched on to one of Gray's deliveries, but only with his heel after escaping at the back post and miscuing a golden opportunity for Lampard's outfit to break the deadlock early on.In the end, the 26-year-old winger had to do it himself to stop Everton emulating the 1990 team.Gray found himself through one-on-one from Pickford's long kick and rolled a composed finish beyond Henderson to save the Toffees' blushes and earn his side's first point of the term - one that was greeted with a palpable sense of relief by the home fans.""When you have 19 shots at home you expect to see more than one goal,"" said Lampard, who believes his side should have won the game.""To be more clinical we need to find those moments and be ruthless on them - some players have that by nature, some not so much.

""It was a poor goal to concede and we shouldn't be conceding it at this level, but let's not lose sight of all the good things we did.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62529372

And it was the Danish midfielder who then pulled one back following a move off the training ground as he peeled of his marker to smash Bryan Mbeumo's corner past Fulham keeper Bernd Leno.Football is so painful when you lose - FrankIf Norgaard was lucky to remain on the field, so too was Palhinha, who only received a yellow for a late aerial challenge with Ben Mee which left the Brentford defender on the turf. Brentford continued to push for the equaliser after the break and Toney surged clear twice in quick succession and shot into the bottom corner but was ruled offside, before his third attempt counted after a cushioned finish.The hosts managed to wrestle back momentum and Mitrovic threatened twice, but his one-on-one opportunity after Norgaard's loose backpass was well-kept out by Raya, before the Brentford keeper also palmed away a header from the Serb.But the Fulham frontman was not to be denied late on as rose highest to power a header into the corner and seal a first win of the season for the newly-promoted side.

One of the other goals in that run came in Leicester's last win, which was against the Saints on the final day of last season.Leicester could have done with imposing centre-back Fofana when Southampton equalised, as they failed to deal with a throw-in before Adams slotted in. James Justin desperately tried to stop the shot on the line but helped it on its way in instead.The Saints were in the ascendancy then and briefly thought they had a penalty when Joe Aribo went round goalkeeper Ward and went to ground, but he was booked for diving.It was Adams who would be the match winner with a beautiful flying volley after Kyle Walker-Peters had fed Ward-Prowse on the right win to cross in. Adams went close to a hat-trick late on when he struck the post.Victory eased the pressure on Hasenhuttl, but increased it on Rodgers, whose Leicester side have now lost five points from winning positions in their three Premier League games this season.

Captain Martin Odegaard put the Gunners in control inside the opening 10 minutes with a well-taken double. After the break, William Saliba curled home a beautiful third before Gabriel Jesus saw his clever finish ruled out by VAR for offside.It is the first time Arsenal have won their opening three fixtures since the 2004-05 season.Bournemouth had won their first home game back in the Premier League against Aston Villa and there was a rousing feel to this Saturday teatime kick-off at the division's smallest ground.It took a mere five minutes for that feeling to be punctured as Odegaard tapped in after Bournemouth keeper Mark Travers had saved Gabriel Martinelli's low strike.The Norway midfielder struck again shortly after when he nabbed the ball off Jesus' toes to sweep a clinical left-footed finish past the helpless Cherries keeper.Arsenal bided their time before sealing the win but did it in style when the impressive Saliba elegantly found the top corner from the edge of the penalty area.Jesus was then denied a deserved goal by a tight VAR review that ruled him just offside from Odegaard's clever through ball.It is very early days - and there are far harder tests to come - but the Gunners have laid down a marker with their superb start to the season.Go straight to all the best Bournemouth contentVisit our Arsenal pageUnchanged Arsenal reap rewardWilliam Saliba has now scored two goals this season, this strike following up his own goal against Leicester last SaturdayWins against Crystal Palace and Leicester meant Arteta had no qualms naming the same starting line-up for this one, the first time Arsenal have had an unchanged team for their opening three fixtures since the 2003-04 season - the last time they won the league.It was clear from kick-off that confidence is high and Odegaard's early opener was reward for fine build-up, including a dynamic run from Jesus to create the chance for Martinelli.Odegaard's quiet influence on this Arsenal side was made more obvious when he doubled the lead five minutes later.Young France centre-back Saliba has won plenty of plaudits already this season and capped another fine performance with a delicious strike into the top corner from Granit Xhaka's cutback.For the raucous travelling fans, the only thing missing from a perfect away day was a Jesus goal, the Brazil striker having one disallowed before being denied by a fine Travers save late on.With an appealing run of fixtures ahead, the Gunners have a chance to make their presence felt at the top of the table.For Bournemouth, Scott Parker responded to last Saturday's heavy defeat at Manchester City by naming a physical side, the selections of Ben Pearson, Jefferson Lerma and Kieffer Moore no doubt intended to unsettle Arsenal.Instead, it left them sluggish to the Gunners' slick passing and unable to get out when penned in their own half. Changes at the break brought a brief improvement, only for Saliba's strike to squash them again.The Cherries are in need of reinforcements, with defenders and forwards both surely on Scott Parker's wishlist after new signing Marcos Senesi was given a torrid time by Jesus on his full Bournemouth debut.They will have more mobility upfront when Dominic Solanke is fully fit, but against this class of opposition, the squad looks short of Premier League quality.With a daunting trip to Anfield up next, it may get worse before it gets better for Parker's side.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62529370

But Palace had a golden chance of their own when Zaha struck the far post when he should have scored, as Liverpool remain without a win from their first two games.No excuse for Nunez madnessDarwin Nunez has made an excellent impression in his early days at Liverpool following his move from Benfica, scoring in the Community Shield win against Manchester City and also getting on target in the opening weekend draw at Fulham.Here, he left Anfield with his head bowed after a totally inexcusable moment of ill-discipline that reduced Liverpool to 10 men and weakened their attacking impetus.Nunez may have been wound up by Andersen but what followed was idiotic and expensive as he thrust his head straight into the Palace defender, leaving Tierney with no option but to send him off.The brilliant Diaz stepped into the breach with a moment of magic for the equaliser while Harvey Elliott was also outstanding before he was substituted.Liverpool had moments towards the end but were uncomfortable when Palace pressed, so had to settle for a draw that already leaves them four points behind expected title rivals Manchester City.Palace show resilience and threatPatrick Vieira's Crystal Palace demonstrated in their opening game against Arsenal, even in defeat, that they have the capability to build on the development they showed in the manager's first campaign.And they will take huge self-confidence and belief after a point at Anfield which, with better finishing, could even have been three.Palace spent much of the game defending, with Andersen and Marc Guehi solid, but Zaha's goal on the counter-attack showed what they are all about, with Eze another fine contributor.Zaha was a danger all night but held his head in anguish when he could only turn that opportunity at the far post against the upright with the goal at his mercy.Palace held firm in the closing stages despite having to contend with a wall of noise from the Kop to earn a draw that will delight them, as will their performance.Follow all the match analysis and reactionVisit our Liverpool pageGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62460772

Moussa Niakhate and Awoniyi both threatened with headers, while Neco Williams drew a decent save from Lukasz Fabianski, who also had to palm away a goal-bound header from team-mate Soucek.The backing kept Forest going on a blisteringly hot day - and the reward came in first-half stoppage time.Awoniyi spent six years as a Liverpool player without making a single first-team appearance, before moving to Union Berlin in 2021 and then, a year later, to Forest.As with a number of the club's summer recruits, Awoniyi has a point to prove. His finish was reactive, but he needed to be in the right place at the right time - and his name will now go into Forest folklore along with all the other great names associated with the two-time European Cup winners.Henderson is another who wants to show how good he is.

Tuchel, once his very obvious anger subsides, will be satisfied with large parts of Chelsea's performance, which really ought to have brought a win. Chelsea pressed with greater efficiency than they did when Romelu Lukaku was leading the line and were a more composed and compact side than Spurs, who struggled to find any rhythm but still had enough to get a point. Tuchel will question why Anthony Taylor did not award a foul when Bentancur dived in on Havertz, and Chelsea also felt Cucurella was fouled before Perisic's corner that was turned home by Kane. The scenes between the two managers were part of the drama and showed how high feelings were running, but both Tuchel and Conte can expect to hear from the authorities. Chelsea's summer signings made their contributions as Koulibaly and Cucurella combined for one goal and Sterling set up James but there was no doubt who was the more satisfied manager at the final whistle.

Lucas Digne turned a cross into his own net immediately after to give Everton hope, and they staged a late rally as Gordon was twice denied by Martinez, but Villa held firm to take the three points.Reaction to Aston Villa's win against Everton and the rest of Saturday's actionVilla bounce back as Mings returns Aston Villa 'looked a different team' - Steven GerrardVilla desperately needed a good start to this season after they finished last term with just two wins from their final 10 games, and that poor form continued with a 2-0 loss at newly promoted Bournemouth in their opening game.Gerrard caused a stir by replacing Tyrone Mings with John McGinn as the Villa captain and starting Mings on the bench against the Cherries, but the former Liverpool captain will probably have felt somewhat vindicated by his decision during this game.There were no signs of disharmony as Mings put in an assured performance on his return to the first XI, while it was McGinn's brilliance that led to the opening goal as he won the ball off McNeil before playing a superb pass to Watkins, who then teed up Ings to score.Villa really should have been out of sight by the time Buendia added a second and the late Everton pressure will have given Gerrard some discomfort - but overall this was a decent Villa display that will provide encouragement for the fans about the season ahead.Everton defence bolstered but problems remain in attackAston Villa 2-1 Everton: Frank Lampard calls for patience with new arrivalsLampard clearly targeted his defence as an area for improvement over the summer with former Burnley centre-back James Tarkowski making his debut in last weekend's defeat at Chelsea and on-loan Wolves defender Conor Coady starting in this game.It was an area that certainly needed improving after Everton came close to being relegated last season but this game again highlighted their deficiencies at the other end of the pitch.They did not manage a shot on target until eight minutes into the second half and it took a slice of fortune to get them back into the game through the own goal.Everton's late pressure was encouraging but it is clear the Toffees need reinforcements in attack if they are to avoid another difficult season.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62445693

""We just missed that last little bit, that last little finish, little piece of quality, and their keeper has made some good saves.""Brighton 0-0 Newcastle United: Eddie HoweFollowing his side's comfortable win at home to newly promoted Forest last Saturday, Eddie Howe was hoping Newcastle could ""impose their style"" on a Brighton side who have never lost at home to the Magpies in the top flight.The visitors had opportunities to hurt their opponents on the counter-attack in the first half through Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin, but the Magpies' final ball was often poor.""Brighton played very well,"" said Howe.

""You are in the middle, how can you survive that?""So it is difficult, we know. And we will find many of these situations, but it is just a little bit of question of time.""With the right movement and the right tempo, and with the quality of the players that we have behind him to assist him, we will find him - I don't have any doubts about that.""De Bruyne dazzles againCity had dominated since kick-off, and it did not take long for more goals to follow Gundogan's opener.The impressive Kevin de Bruyne made it 2-0 with a dazzling solo strike, gliding to the corner of the area before bending the ball into the bottom corner with the outside of his boot.And Phil Foden made sure of the points before half-time, running on to a De Bruyne pass and letting fly with a shot that Cherries keeper Mark Travers got his body behind, but could not keep out.Bournemouth spent most of their time defending in a compact 5-4-1 formation, and only forced home keeper Ederson into action once, through a Ben Pearson snap-shot from the edge of the area.They never looked remotely capable of staging a comeback in the second half, which had turned into a stroll in the Manchester sunshine for the home side long before Jefferson Lerma's own goal made it 4-0.Lerma was trying to stop Joao Cancelo's low cross from reaching substitute Bernardo Silva, but only succeeded in sending the ball spinning past Travers to complete an afternoon to forget for his team.Reaction to Man City v Bournemouth and the rest of Saturday's actionGo straight to all the best Manchester City contentVisit our AFC Bournemouth pageNo Haaland goal - but no problems for CityMan City 4-0 Bournemouth: Guardiola says players will learn to play with HaalandIt already seems somewhat surprising to see City score four times without Haaland getting any of them, but this victory was a reminder of the goal threat that runs right through this team, not just from their new striker.Bournemouth were under threat from the first minute, when Nathan Ake headed wide from a corner, with Rodri nodding over from the same source soon afterwards.Riyad Mahrez and Foden also forced saves from Travers in the opening 10 minutes, although Haaland may feel Foden should have squared the ball to find him unmarked in front of goal instead of shooting.If Haaland was getting frustrated at his lack of involvement, he did not let it show - instead using his power to hold off his marker and set up Gundogan for a cool finish that sent City on their way.De Bruyne's brilliance created their second and third goals, but Haaland's chances of getting on the scoresheet remained limited.After the Norwegian's heavy touch from a Ruben Dias pass into the area - when Travers collected the ball before Haaland could control it - the Cherries keeper tipped over his lob when he did get a shot away.Haaland's two passes against BournemouthHaaland's last chance came and went when he screwed wide from a Jack Grealish pull-back with 20 minutes to go, and he was replaced by Julian Alvarez moments later.The former Borussia Dortmund man's eight touches - his only other pass apart from his assist was when he kicked off the second half - were the fewest of any player who started the game, but he was still given a standing ovation from the home fans. On this evidence, City remain hard to stop even when he is not at his very best.Bournemouth happy with damage limitationMan City 4-0 Bournemouth: Parker says side came up against world class opponentsBournemouth had began the season in impressive style themselves, with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa, but they never came close to repeating that result here.Scott Parker's side struggled to get out of their own half with the score at 0-0 and paid the price for trying to get further up the pitch after falling behind.They only succeeded in leaving City space to break into for the first time, and De Bruyne punished them with his brilliant finish after reaching the edge of the Cherries area without being challenged.When Bournemouth did finally get the ball up to Kieffer Moore at the other end, he created a shooting opportunity for Pearson, but any sights of goal were few and far between for the visitors.Damage limitation seemed a more sensible approach for Parker's side than chasing a way back into the game - especially given the soaring temperatures at Etihad Stadium, and the quality of the opposition.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62445690

We made a few changes and told them what we are doing now and the reaction was amazing. ""The biggest pride from my side was them working out how we want to play and take points.""Rodrigo had handed Leeds the advantage with two goals in 15 second-half minutes as the visitors looked on course to maintain their winning start to the season.The Spain forward met Jack Harrison's testing cross with a glancing finish to open the scoring, before heading in Pascal Struijk's goal-bound effort for his second.Saints debutant Sekou Mara played an influential role off the bench with the precise through-ball for Walker-Peters' equaliser, and he nearly won it late on, but his fierce strike was well saved by Illan Meslier.Leeds remain unbeaten after their opening two games and move up to fourth in the table, while Saints are off the foot of the table and climb into 15th place.

Fulham should have taken the lead in the first half after Andreas Pereira's corner found Decordova-Reid unmarked for a header but new Wolves captain Ruben Neves made a heroic goalline clearance. Wolves 0-0 Fulham: Marco Silva says his team showed 'great spirit'The Cottagers almost gifted the home team a goal a few moments later following a mix-up in defence between Rodak and Tosin Adarabioyo, but neither Neto nor Podence could capitalise on the mistake. Mitrovic had been quiet for most of the game and his only chance of note prior to the penalty was a ballooned shot into the stands during the first 45 minutes. The frustration following his weak spot-kick, however, boiled over as a challenge on Morgan Gibbs-White led to the pair squaring up to each other and both receiving a booking in added time. Wolves rue missed chances again Lage opted to keep new £27.5m signing Goncalo Guedes on the bench against Fulham, rather than place Wolves' search for goals completely on the former Valencia forward's shoulders. The home crowd were given encouraging signs that this could be the day their fortunes changed as Fulham's left flank was targeted with success in the opening exchanges by Podence, plus neat play between Neto and South Korean Hwang. But for all Wolves' hard work, they could not find a way past Rodak and more chances were squandered in the second half. Ait-Nouri played a tantalising ball into the Fulham box for Gibbs-White to slide in and slot home but the midfielder skied his effort over the bar. Wolves need to 'grow up' as a team- LageOne win and one draw for Fulham on their return to the Premier League would have been welcomed by most of the club's supporters but boss Marco Silva will be left disappointed that full points were not secured at Molineux.Despite not performing as tenaciously as they did against Jurgen Klopp's Reds, there was a positive feel at the final whistle that the Championship winners can still get something out of a game when not playing at their best. And if Mitrovic's penalty had beaten Sa, he would have equalled his tally from the Cottagers' last season in the top flight in 2020-21 - when he scored just three all season.

Mathias Jensen doubled the lead after dispossessing former Brentford player Christian Eriksen, with Ben Mee and Bryan Mbeumo goals putting Thomas Frank's side four up during an incredible first half in which they dismantled United in stunning fashion. The defeat is United's seventh in a row on the road - their worst run since 1936 - while it is the seventh time they have conceded at least four goals in a league game since the start of last season.While Brentford can bask in a historic win, United boss Erik ten Hag faces the unenviable task of lifting his players in time for the visit of Liverpool to Old Trafford on Monday, 22 August.

De Gea, who for so long has been one of United's most consistent performers, was left red-faced when he allowed Dasilva's speculative shot from distance to slip underneath him and into the net, with Cristiano Ronaldo claiming he was fouled in the build-up. Harry Maguire was then booked for a clumsy lunge on Dasilva, and while Mathias Jensen missed from the resultant free-kick, the Danish midfielder was celebrating two minutes later following another United mistake. De Gea's pass to Eriksen on the edge of the United penalty area led to Jensen stealing the ball before slotting low into the net to double Brentford's lead.After falling two behind to Brighton last week, it was another stern examination of United's character, but it only got worse as Brentford struck twice in the space of five minutes to move four clear.Mee nodded home at the far post to make it three before Mbeumo finished off a rapid counter-attack when he controlled Ivan Toney's pass before curling the ball beyond a helpless De Gea to put the Bees four up after a scarcely believable 35 minutes.Manager Ten Hag could barely have envisaged such a catastrophic start to his reign, and while there is still time for the Dutchman to transform their fortunes, the first two games of the season have underlined the daunting task facing the former Ajax boss at Old Trafford.Brentford a breath of fresh airBrentford 4-0 Manchester United: I hope people credit ‘unreal’ Bees – Thomas FrankWhile much of the post-match discussion will focus on United's problems, Brentford - like Brighton last week - deserve praise for their approach and execution. From the first whistle, they tormented United, refusing to allow the visitors time on the ball and, crucially, took their chances to leave their opponents in the dust.The first goal arrived when Jensen robbed Ronaldo inside the United half and fed the onrushing Dasilva. With Lisandro Martinez - subbed at half-time - slow to close off the space, Dasilva sent a low shot towards the goal that escaped De Gea's grasp. That set the tone for the first half as Brentford ran riot. The impressive Jensen anticipated De Gea's risky pass to Eriksen and punished both players, before Toney used his height advantage to beat Martinez in the air and tee up Mee, who marked his home debut with a goal. The fourth goal summed up the difference between the sides. After Jadon Sancho was muscled off the ball inside the Brentford box, the hosts pumped the ball long to Toney. With United slow to react to the developing counter-attack, Toney slipped in Mbeumo, who shook off Luke Shaw and swept the ball home to spark delirious scenes among the home fans. Ten Hag's response was to introduce Raphael Varane, Scott McTominay and Tyrell Malacia at the break, but with his players apparently in shock, United were unable to mount the miraculous comeback required to salvage something from the game as Brentford strolled to a victory that will live long in the memory.MOTD analysis: How ‘pathetic’ Manchester United were thumped by Brentford",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62445694

Protests against the United owners before kick-off meant the club shop had to be shut.Co-chairman Avie Glazer was paying a rare visit and would have heard the songs to his left calling for his family to get out of the club.On the pitch, there was no cohesion despite decent debuts from Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez.Brighton, well drilled and fluid, took advantage. Leandro Trossard volleyed into the side-netting within 15 seconds of the start and United failed to impose themselves on the game until it was far too late.For the opener, Welbeck's run split Maguire and Martinez. The latter came across from the left to cover the cross, leaving a huge hole in the six-yard box and, as United's defence scrambled to plug the gaps, Gross was on his own to tap home at the far post.He was in a similar position but on the other post when Solly March cut inside and unleashed a low shot, which keeper David de Gea turned into his path.The boos that accompanied the half-time whistle were predictable and deserved. Within eight minutes of the resumption, Ronaldo had been introduced to try and lead a rescue mission.The 37-year-old had a negligible impact. It was another Portuguese, Diogo Dalot, who created the confusion that led to United's goal. But by the end it was Brighton who looked more likely to score again.Potter's fabulous jobPotter hails ""amazing"" BrightonAmid the inevitable soul-searching for United at this dreadful result, Potter's influence at Brighton should not be underestimated.He has lost Yves Bissouma and Marc Cucurella for a combined £88m from the side that beat United in May.

156,West Ham 0-2 Man City: Erling Haaland scores twice as Man City turn on style,SUN 07 Aug 2022,premier-league,"MOTD2 analysis: How 'outstanding' Haaland saw off West HamErling Haaland opened his Manchester City goal account and demonstrated the huge threat he will pose this season as the champions began the defence of their Premier League crown in impressive fashion at West Ham United.The brilliant 22-year-old Norwegian striker delivered exactly what City manager Pep Guardiola wanted following his summer signing from Borussia Dortmund when he gave City the lead from the penalty spot nine minutes before half-time, after he was brought down by West Ham's substitute goalkeeper Alphonse Areola.He was on as substitute for injured Lukasz Fabianski but was helpless when Haaland wrapped up City's win after 65 minutes with a composed left-foot finish from Kevin de Bruyne's perfect pass.City won at a canter against a strangely passive West Ham, who barely threatened after a brief opening burst, spending long spells out of possession as the champions exerted almost complete command.Man City lay down a markerIt was a proud moment for me and my family - HaalandManchester City have wasted no time in demonstrating they will be the team to beat in the Premier League title race this season with a superbly controlled display.Once City had seen off West Ham's early efforts they dominated possession and won with so much to spare that there were thousands of empty seats in London Stadium long before the final whistle.West Ham 0-2 Man City: Haaland an 'incredible threat' - Pep GuardiolaCity did not need to exert themselves but they present an ominous prospect for their rivals with the power, skill and goalscoring ability of Haaland bolted onto the sort of service he will receive from the likes of De Bruyne and Phil Foden.Guardiola gave his other summer signing, England midfield man Kalvin Phillips, a couple of minutes to ease in with the game won.And an encounter that was flagged up as a potentially fierce test for City proved to be a stroll, with three points a formality long before the end.Haaland will rightly claim the headlines but all of City's other qualities were on show in a package that will have Premier League defences looking nervously at what might face them when they meet Guardiola's side.This was as easy as it gets against a West Ham side who tested City to the limit here last season and were a formidable prospect at home - but not here as they were put away with consummate ease.Passive Hammers get what they deserveWest Ham 0-2 Man City: David Moyes says Irons 'well outplayed' by Manchester CityWest Ham went into the game with high hopes, although manager David Moyes felt he could not risk new £30m striker Gianluca Scammaca from the start.Instead, following a bright first few minutes, West Ham barely laid a glove on City, sitting back almost waiting to be beaten, which they inevitably were.Declan Rice tried in vain to exert some influence but West Ham were so starved of the ball that they simply could not get a foothold in the game.It led to groans of frustration from West Ham fans inside London Stadium as they demanded their team at least try to apply pressure on City.There will be better days ahead for Moyes and West Ham when they assemble all of their new faces before the end of the transfer window but this was a chastening day for a club that has been looking forward to the season with such optimism.Go straight to all the best West Ham contentVisit our Manchester City page",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62366384
157,Fulham 2-2 Liverpool: Aleksandar Mitrovic scores twice to shock Reds,SAT 06 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Aleksandar Mitrovic scored his first Premier League goal for Fulham at Craven Cottage since 29 January 2019, when he netted two headers in a 4-2 win against BrightonDarwin Nunez came off the bench to score one and create another as Liverpool were forced to twice battle back to salvage a point in a chaotic game at newly promoted Fulham.The Reds, who pushed champions Manchester City all the way in the title race last season, fell behind when Aleksandar Mitrovic got the better of Trent Alexander-Arnold to head Fulham ahead after meeting a superb cross by Kenny Tete.Luis Diaz had a goal ruled out for offside at 0-0 before curling a shot against the post after Fulham had taken the lead.In a thrilling match, substitute Nunez marked his Premier League debut by equalising with a close-range flick before Fulham restored the lead from the penalty spot after Mitrovic was fouled by Virgil van Dijk.Mitrovic picked himself up to beat Alisson from the spot before Mohamed Salah equalised from close range after a pass by Nunez, a £64m signing from Benfica.Jordan Henderson went close to winning it at the end when he hit the bar in the fifth minute of stoppage time.The performance needs massive improvement - KloppWill Aleksandar Mitrovic replicate his scoring feats in Premier League?Fulham give Reds a real scareFulham deserved something more - SilvaFulham's previous Premier League win was against Liverpool on 7 March 2021 but, on that occasion, it was not enough to save them from relegation.On a gorgeous day in west London, they showed they are up for the challenge facing them on their return to the Premier League after giving Jurgen Klopp's side a real scare.Their aim this season is to establish themselves in esteemed company and, while there is a long road ahead, this was a highly encouraging start.Last season's champions of the Championship were certainly not intimidated as they took the game to the Reds, the lively Mitrovic signalling his intention by firing wide with 50 seconds on the clock after darting into the box.Marco Silva's side were well organised and played with confidence as they created nine chances - three on target - during an entertaining match.They went close to going 2-0 ahead when Neeskens Kebano hit the post while new signings Joao Palhinha and Andreas Pereira added creativity.MOTD Analysis: How Aleksandar Mitrovic caused problems for Liverpool""I think that our organisation, our great first half, the way we blocked almost everything from them, in terms of organisation in the first half - it was almost perfect,"" said Fulham boss Silva.It took Fulham until the fifth game to register a first point the last time they started a Premier League season in 2020-21.They are up and running after one game this time thanks, in part, to a dynamic performance from Mitrovic.""In the box Mitro will score if you provide him good chances,"" added Silva. ""But I repeat something I said last season maybe 20 times: Mitro is not just a goalscorer for us. He did an unbelievable job for us without the ball.""Thiago injury adds to Klopp's worriesFulham 2-2 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp says result was only positiveThis is the fourth straight season the Reds have opened a Premier League campaign against a promoted side, but it was anything but a straightforward start for Klopp's side.With Curtis Jones, Diogo Jota, Konstantinos Tsimikas, Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ibrahima Konate either ill or injured, Liverpool's bench included a 20-year-old, one 19-year-old and 17-year-old Stefan Bajcetic.Fortunately, it also included Nunez.For the second successive weekend he came off the bench to make a valuable contribution as he followed up his performance in the Community Shield win over Manchester City with another goal.He produced a clever flick to make it 1-1 before the Uruguay forward was heavily involved in Salah's equaliser to make it 2-2.A concern for Klopp will be a mounting injury list with the season barely under way. The loss of Thiago Alcantara to a suspected hamstring injury early in the second half will add to Liverpool's worries, and it remains to be seen whether they will turn to the transfer market to ease their problems before the 1 September deadline.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62358041
158,Bournemouth 2-0 Aston Villa: Jefferson Lerma and Kieffer Moore score in victory,SAT 06 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Kieffer Moore started his career in the Conference South with Truro City in 2012 and Bournemouth became his 12th club in JanuaryBournemouth marked their return to the Premier League with a confident opening-weekend victory over Aston Villa at the Vitality Stadium. The Cherries took the lead on three minutes - with Villa temporarily down to 10 men as left-back Lucas Digne was off the pitch because there was blood on his shirt after a nosebleed. Debutant Marcus Tavernier's corner was headed down by Lloyd Kelly for Jefferson Lerma to fire home.They should have taken a two-goal lead into the interval but Kieffer Moore was unable to meet a low ball into the box from Adam Smith, who had been played through by the excellent Dominic Solanke.Wales international Moore, who at the age of 29 was making his debut in the top flight, eventually doubled the home side's lead with a commanding header on 80 minutes after Kelly played a dangerous cross back into Villa's area.Prior to that, Danny Ings had a shot saved by Cherries keeper Mark Travers and new Villa captain John McGinn saw a long-range drive go high and wide, but it was debutant Boubacar Kamara who had gone closest to an equaliser for the visitors. The French midfielder - a free transfer from Marseille - found himself in space and unleashed a right-footed effort from 30 yards that just went wide.Championship runners-up Bournemouth visit defending Premier League champions Manchester City next, while Villa welcome Everton.Bournemouth 2-0 Aston Villa: Scott Parker hails Cherries' 'desire'Cherries delight, Villa disappointedBournemouth are likely to face a tough task to avoid relegation in their first season back in the Premier League but for now, at least, boss Scott Parker can be pleased with the spirit shown by his team in front of their home supporters. After signing a four-year extension to stay until the summer of 2026, Solanke offered the same physical presence up front that saw him contribute 29 goals to the Cherries' promotion campaign last season. A promising debut by new recruit Tavernier should also satisfy Parker. He had described the former Middlesbrough midfielder as ""a big signing"" after recruiting him for a fee reported to be about £10m, and Tavernier was an attacking threat in support of Solanke and former non-league striker Moore. Conversely, there was little to impress Villa manager Steven Gerrard. They were sluggish from the off and playmaker Philippe Coutinho, who made his loan move from Barcelona permanent in May, was among those who were largely anonymous.The chances for Kamara and Ings gave the travelling supporters minor moments of excitement, but Gerrard will be hoping this is just a bump in the road and not a continuation of their poor run at the end of last season, which finished with only two wins from 11 games.Not the result we came for - GerrardReaction from Saturday's Premier League matchesVisit our Bournemouth pageGo straight to all the best Aston Villa content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62358040
159,Leeds 2-1 Wolves: Jesse Marsch's side show fight and clearer plan to beat Wolves,SAT 06 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Brenden Aaronson (centre) was one of four debutants in the Leeds side for the win over WolvesAs the final whistle blew on Leeds' feisty and fierce opening-game victory over Wolves, the Elland Road crowd roared their delight, the players punched the air and manager Jesse Marsch almost came to blows with opposite number Bruno Lage. 'I Predict A Riot' has never felt a more appropriate soundtrack.The Kaiser Chiefs song, with its growling depiction of menace and confrontation on the streets of the band's hometown, is now an anthem at Elland Road following home victories - and could well be a template for how Marsch wants his team to front up.In this soft reboot of the determined but ragged side that salvaged safety on the final day of last season, there was energy, endeavour and more than a little appetite for a fight as they battled their way back from Daniel Podence's early goal to seal victory.Rodrigo fired them level with an angled drive in the first half and Ryan Ait-Nouri found his own net for the winner. In between there was a lot of harrying, high pressing and hearty tackles.There was also a wobble, when Wolves came on strong and perilously close to exposing the weaknesses in Marsch's side for 25 minutes after half-time.Had the visitors a more ruthless centre-forward - such as the injured Raul Jimenez - to fire the ammunition provided by Podence and Pedro Neto, they would likely have three points themselves.Instead, though, Leeds had the final word on the pitch, leaving Marsch and Lage to argue over who would claim it on the touchline.Reaction and analysis from Saturday's Premier League games, including Leeds v Wolves'The three points validate our work'Marsch impressed by debutants in Leeds winAfter the game, Marsch played down the argument, describing it as ""nothing, really"" and ""normal in a lot of ways"".This left the Portuguese boss to provide greater clarity on something that had been brewing throughout the match.""In the first half, there were things that we cannot say, especially in these days, and I heard that. So if someone wants to apologise to me, it should be in that moment, not in the end when you've won the game,"" he said.""There were plenty of moments between the first half and the end of the game when we could have shaken hands and apologised - it didn't happen and in the end it's more difficult to accept because there was a long time to do that.""There's nothing wrong between the managers. Life goes on.""What is clear from the end of last season and the early stages of this is that Marsch is not a man to take a backward step, nor does he expect his teams to do so.There is a famous image from his playing days with Chivas USA of the then midfielder nose-to-nose with LA Galaxy's David Beckham after having booted the ex-England player in the stomach. Undaunted by his rival's reputation, Marsch stands his ground.Marsch played for a number of Major League Soccer sides before moving into coachingOne thing he will not be is cowed by the managerial microscope under which he now sits, stripped of the shielding set of dire circumstances which surrounded the club when he was appointed.Marsch deserves huge credit for his role in driving Leeds to the points they needed to survive relegation in 2021-22 - often seemingly through determination rather than design - but now he needs to be a man with a plan.With four debutants on the field and a fit-again Patrick Bamford to lead the attack, there were certainly clearer signs of one.Some parts worked better than others. Tyler Adams and Marc Roca showed signs they can complement each other in midfield as successors to Kalvin Phillips, the former tasked with the winning the ball, the latter to distribute pinpoint forward passes.Rasmus Kristensen was all-action at full-back, but may need greater help in such a narrow formation against sides like Wolves with wide players eager to double up in attack.Most impressive of all was Brenden Aaronson, who was a constant source of energy and endeavour, some of which he used to dart into the box and force Ait-Nouri to score the winner into his own net from Bamford's cross.He lacks the outright flair of Raphinha - the man he was brought in to help replace - but in his own industrious way could prove as effective.As Marsch pointed out before the game, the team may have lost two stars, but in general it has become stronger, helped by the recent arrival of three players who have operated under the American before in Aaronson, Adams and Rasmussen.It wasn't perfect and at times threatened to topple over as Wolves came on strong after the break, but there was enough there for Leeds to believe they can avoid the trauma of last season's relegation fight.""I am really pleased that we look like a team that understands what the tactics and ideas are with the ball much better than we did last season,"" said Marsch. ""It was a big struggle to implement tactically what we want to achieve.""We still have a lot of work to do but the three points validates the pre-season we have had and the work we have done.""'The club are talking with players'Wolves manager Bruno Lage says his team were the better sideWolves' deficiencies are clear to see. So are their qualities.Nathan Collins remains their only significant signing of the summer, with the ex-Burnley man making an efficient debut at Elland Road in the middle of a back four that did not include stalwart Conor Coady.With Jimenez sidelined for a few more weeks and Fabio Silva out on loan, they desperately need some firepower to complement the creative powers of their wide forwards.They finished 10th last season after having scored the fewest goals of any club to remain in the division, but to gamble on a repeat would be foolhardy.Lage was pleased with his side's performance - one that would have yielded greater reward but for key misses by Hwang Hee-chan and Leander Dendoncker - but is aware of the need for reinforcements.""I think we did a good game,"" Lage said. ""I think we were the better team, we created a lot of chances, and we didn't score. I'm happy with the performance, but not happy with the result.""I said before the game that we came here with big confidence, and we'll score goals because the pre-season was good and we have confidence to play in this system. I was right to feel that confidence, and we continued to play.""He added: ""It's time to be patient because we are talking with players. I know the club are talking with players and those players can come and increase the level of the team and the squad. ""They will give solutions that we didn't have today.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62358052
160,Newcastle United 2-0 Nottingham Forest: Magpies overcome visitors' stubborn resistance,SAT 06 Aug 2022,premier-league,"Fabian Schar's second-half effort was similar to the one he scored against Burnley in the Premier League in 2019A Fabian Schar wonder goal and Callum Wilson's deft finish broke newly promoted Nottingham Forest's stubborn resistance as Newcastle opened their Premier League campaign with a deserved victory at St James' Park.Centre-back Schar collected a loose ball on the edge of the box before sending a blistering effort into the net via the inside of the near post - a goal not dissimilar to the Switzerland international's strike against Burnley in February 2019.Wilson put the result beyond doubt 12 minutes from time, directing a first-time flick over Dean Henderson and into the far corner from Joelinton's cross.The pressure on the visitors' goal was relentless from the first minute, but for all Newcastle's territorial dominance they struggled to seriously test Forest goalkeeper Henderson in the first half.Joelinton went closest to a breakthrough for the home side before half-time, dragging his shot wide from close range following a striding run from midfield.Steve Cooper's side failed to register a shot on target but were denied an unlikely opener by Schar in the first half, the Magpies defender producing an outstanding block to deny Jesse Lingard inside the Newcastle area.The result stretches Forest's losing league run at St James' Park to seven matches.Relive text commentary of Newcastle v Nottingham Forest, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League gamesVisit our Newcastle pageGo straight to all the best Nottingham Forest contentNewcastle 2-0 Nottingham Forest: Howe says his side were 'excellent from start to finish'Magpies' patience pays offAs was the case back in January, Newcastle's summer recruitment has focused primarily on reinforcing defensive areas, with Sven Botman, Nick Pope and Matt Targett - who enjoyed a successful loan spell at St James' Park last season - joining Eddie Howe's side.The concern among some Newcastle fans is that they remain thin on the ground at the other end of the pitch - Chris Wood has scored just once from open play for the club, while Wilson has missed 31 of the Magpies' 77 Premier League games through injury since signing from Bournemouth in September 2020.While Newcastle thoroughly deserved the three points on Saturday, the hosts' somewhat toothless first-half performance highlighted why Howe is so keen to bolster his attacking options before the transfer window closes on 1 September.Allan Saint-Maximin, Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes all tried their luck from distance but either shot too close to Henderson or - in Guimaraes' case - failed to hit the target altogether.The tireless Joe Willock forced Henderson into a low save as Newcastle continued to apply pressure in the second half, before Saint-Maximin was thwarted by Scott McKenna's last-ditch challenge.The longer the game went on, the more it seemed the Magpies would require a moment of inspiration to break down Forest - and Schar duly obliged with a goal of the highest quality shortly before the hour mark.Wilson had a quiet afternoon but, like all good strikers, he took his chance with aplomb when it arrived and has now scored in the opening game in four of the past five Premier League seasons. The former Bournemouth striker could have added a third late on but only managed to steer Sean Longstaff's low cross into the side netting from a tight angle.While Forest failed to register a shot on target, there was much to admire about the visitors' attitude and work ethic at St James' Park as they frustrated the home team for long spells.If they can maintain that resilience throughout the campaign, they stand a good chance of keeping their heads above water this term.Newcastle were the better team - Cooper",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62358050

Spurs fell behind in the 12th minute to James Ward-Prowse's volley - the midfielder driving the ball into the ground and watching the bounce beat Hugo Lloris - but the response from Antonio Conte's side was swift and ruthless.Ryan Sessegnon headed in his first Premier League goal for the club from an inviting Dejan Kulusevski cross to draw the hosts level and by the half-hour mark they were in front.Eric Dier had not scored in three years but met a whipped Son Heung-min delivery with a low, flicked header into the far corner. Tottenham carried that confidence into the second half and Mohammed Salisu turned Emerson Royal's cross into his own net, before the impressive Kulusevski grabbed a well-taken fourth to cap a stylish and dominant display.""We won three important points but the most important thing was the way we got three points - with really good football, with the ball, without the ball, with important pressure,"" said Conte. ""The way we decided to win the ball after we lost it was another important aspect.""We are working to implement football knowledge over the last season.

Conte joked beforehand, though it took Ward-Prowse's strike, following smart play from Moussa Djenepo, to spark his side into life on the opening day.With Richarlison suspended and other new recruits still building up to full fitness, there was a familiar look to the Spurs XI, albeit with two unfamiliar names on the scoresheet.Sessegnon and Dier have been two of the biggest beneficiaries of the Conte era, and both took their headers well to put Spurs in front - the more predictable sources of Son and Kulusevski producing moments of quality to tee up both defenders.""He was always in our offensive position and it was good,"" Conte said of Sessegnon, adding that the 22-year-old can learn from experienced new arrival Ivan Perisic.""I'm happy for him because he has great potential, but has to show this potential.""Conte delight at Tottenham's 'perfect start'This was the first time Tottenham have played a home Premier League game at 3pm on Saturday in 973 days, since beating Burnley 5-0 in December 2019, and the first time they have begun a season in this kick-off slot for more than 20 years. Rarely in those two decades has there been as much optimism in north London and that is unlikely to have been dampened by what for the most part was a confident and entertaining performance. Sessegnon also had an effort ruled out for offside immediately after the break and opposite wing-back Royal's low ball forced Salisu into an own goal, before the Brazilian teed up Kulusevski to find the bottom corner two minutes later.The focus at Southampton has been on youth this summer after signing six players with just two over the age of 20, but it was Saints' Mr Reliable - and last season's top scorer Ward-Prowse - who got the visitors off to a superb start.That hope was short-lived for Ralph Hasenhuttl's side who, as well as having the worst opening-day record of all current Premier League teams, finished last season with four successive defeats and did little to rid themselves of that hangover at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.""It felt a little bit like the opponent switched into the next gear and we cannot follow,"" said the Saints boss. ""This was frustrating to see how big the gap is between the two teams.""After the first goal we had the feeling they were absolutely in the game and they smashed us with their crosses and we couldn't defend.""Southampton not strong enough - Hasenhuttl",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62358043

""I have had this feeling for the first few weeks since the boys started pre-season. They are ready, they look hungry, with that mentality that they really want to win,"" Arteta told Match of the Day.""The team came here to play the way we wanted to play - we were dominant, we were a threat, we were really lively and sharp from the beginning. Then when we felt under pressure we coped with that with resilience.""Follow reaction to Crystal Palace v ArsenalRead the latest Crystal Palace news hereEnjoy the best Arsenal content hereGunners lay down a top-four marker Mikel Arteta praises Arsenal's 'hungry' mentality in win at PalaceBetween Arsenal's savvy transfer business, free-scoring pre-season form and being the focus of Amazon's latest All or Nothing series, there has been plenty to whet their fans' appetites this summer.We may have to wait until the second series to learn whether Arteta piped Palace anthem 'Glad All Over' out during training before this one - as he did with 'You'll Never Walk Alone' before visiting Anfield last season - or whether it was the Spaniard's artwork that set the tone, but his side arrived with a relentless intensity that made Martinelli's opening goal feel inevitable. The 21-year-old Brazilian had earlier missed a glorious chance after Gabriel Jesus waltzed through the Palace defence, skewing wide of the far post after his compatriot's effort was blocked, but he stooped to head in from a clever corner routine. The Gunners lost their opening three league games last season, including another Friday night opener at Brentford, and ultimately narrowly missed out on a return to Champions League football.But they have strengthened with the acquisitions of Jesus and Zinchenko from Manchester City and both already look set to have a big impact on Arteta's young squad. Jesus, who scored seven goals in five pre-season games, caused Palace's back four problems with his relentless work-rate as well as his talent on the ball, and he laid on a chance for Martin Odegaard that the Gunners captain might have done better with. It was another Arsenal debutant who really impressed, with 21-year-old centre back William Saliba - who has spent most of his three years at the club out on loan, producing a fine defensive display.The Frenchman was part of a back four that had to show resilience amid the hosts' growing threat, before Guehi's own goal following a snappy Saka break made things more comfortable.It was a result and performance that will have pleased Arteta, who recorded his 50th league win as Gunners boss, while simultaneously giving Arsenal's top-four rivals a glimpse of what they are up against this term.Palace fail to turn pressure into pointsMissed chances cost Palace - Patrick VieiraPalace boss Patrick Vieira was concerned this game had arrived too early after a disrupted pre-season that saw some of his squad not being able to travel to Singapore and Australia, some players remaining on the treatment table, and the Frenchman still hoping to make more transfer additions.He also said he was happy with the business the Eagles have done so far this window, although only Cheick Doucoure started after arriving from Lens, and Palace struggled to deal with an irrepressible Arsenal early on. The hosts, who took four points off Arsenal last season, did improve and Ramsdale's save from Edouard's header before the break was followed after half-time when the goalkeeper also denied Eberechi Eze following Wilfried Zaha's pass in what kick-started a dominant spell for the Eagles. Palace, who are looking to improve on their 12th-placed finish last season, were unable to capitalise on that pressure and were instead caught out on the break, but Vieira will want to wait until the end of the transfer window before giving a real assessment of where his side are.

The hosts took the lead midway through the first half as Gabriel Martinelli stroked home a penalty after his shot struck Alex Iwobi's arm, with the spot-kick awarded after a video assistant referee check. Eddie Nketiah nodded in following a corner to extend the hosts' lead on 31 minutes, before substitute Donny van de Beek, in what is likely to be his last game for Everton, side-footed in.It proved to be a short reprieve as two second-half goals in three minutes ended the game as a contest. Both came from corners as Cedric Soares slotted home, then Gabriel poked in after Everton had initially cleared. Martin Odegaard added a late fifth as Arsenal finished in fifth place, two points behind Tottenham.Their fans were in good spirits as the players did a lap of the pitch to mark their return to the Europa League after missing out this season.But Arteta said he took no satisfaction from that achievement, with a 2-0 defeat at Newcastle on Monday having handed the crucial advantage.""I'm still in a lot of pain after what happened on Monday,"" he said. ""We have tried to squeeze the lemon as much as we possibly can to get every single drop.""We know where we have to go and we're not going to stop. I'm extremely disappointed. We came up short and that feeling of guilt and not reaching that level is painful.""We needed a miracle today. The league table at end of season doesn't lie. It's true that last year with 67 points Chelsea were in the Champions League, and we have 69 and we are out of it. That's the demand of the league now.""Arteta said he was ""very grateful"" for the support he and the players had received.""I'm a winner and I hate losing and we lost something that we could win and that's why I'm in pain,"" he added. ""I'm sorry.""For Everton, meanwhile, a record-equalling 13th away defeat meant they finished four points clear of the relegation zone.Arsenal celebrate but rue late-season stutterArsenal 5-1 Everton: Arteta pleased with 'great' win over EvertonThe Gunners did all they could to try to finish in the top four for the first time since 2016, but the damage had been done in their two previous games - defeats at north London rivals Spurs and resurgent Newcastle.The second of those losses prompted Granit Xhaka to question his team-mates' character, but they showed an appetite to make up for their performance at St James' Park by putting Everton under pressure from the start. Buoyed by the home crowd, who booed former Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli on his first Everton start, Odegaard was Arsenal's key orchestrator and had two efforts blocked. Asmir Begovic, who replaced Jordan Pickford in goal, also denied Martinelli. Everton looked like they had weathered the storm initially, but then former Gunner Iwobi gifted the hosts a penalty.Martinelli's shot hit the Everton midfielder's arm, and although referee Andre Marriner missed it, once he had checked on the VAR monitor, he reversed his decision.The goal was Martinelli's sixth of the season, and he had a hand in the second too, flicking on a corner, which Alli had failed to clear, and Nkeitah headed in.  The two-goal lead allowed the hosts to settle, though there were chances for Demarai Gray before Rob Holding allowed the ball to run across him for Van de Beek's first Everton goal since his loan move from Manchester United.Two goals in three minutes put the match out of Everton's reach, though, and a second-half comeback akin to their heroics against Crystal Palace on Thursday never looked likely, especially when Odegaard grabbed the goal his performance deserved.Despite the disappointment of missing out on the top four, the season can still be seen as progress for Arteta's young side. But the Arsenal boss will have to deal with the futures of Nketiah, midfielder Mohamed Elneny and striker Alexandre Lacazette, whose contracts all end this summer. He said their futures had been ""decided"" but it was ""very difficult to communicate"". Arteta added: ""They deserve what they had today. To do it earlier one way or other with three situations is very awkward and it could affect the team. We will try to do the right thing.""Everton poor away form continuesArsenal 5-1 Everton: 'We did our job on Thursday' - LampardEverton fans will be further relieved their team extended their 68-year stay in the Premier League on Thursday, as their wretched away form continued.They have won only once away from Goodison Park since August, though a much-changed side did show glimpses of attacking threat.Top scorer Richarlison missed out through injury, while Pickford was rested. Tom Davies also made his first start since November following a knee problem. For much of the first half, Lampard's side had to retreat to a back five, and although Gray drew a save from Aaron Ramsdale and fired over, they could not deal with Arsenal's superior movement and energy.But what will disappoint Lampard most was his side conceding three goals from corners, especially with Michael Keane, Mason Holgate and Jarrad Branthwaite making up the back three. The visiting supporters were in good spirits until Arsenal took a three-goal lead, but having celebrated their top-flight survival on Thursday, their partying was probably done. They still found the energy to celebrate, though, when they heard Manchester City had taken a 3-2 lead against Aston Villa, denying Liverpool the title.

165,Brentford 1-2 Leeds United: Leeds stay up with win against Bees,SUN 22 May 2022,premier-league,"Leeds have lost just one of their last six league games against BrentfordLeeds United manager Jesse Marsch said it took everything he had to keep the Elland Road club in the Premier League.Marsch replaced much-loved Marcelo Bielsa as Leeds boss with 12 games of a troubled campaign remaining and achieved his aim of avoiding relegation with a last-day victory at Brentford.Jack Harrison's added-time winner removed any lingering doubts over survival, sparking scenes of celebration on the pitch, in the stands and the technical area, where the American manager lay on his back in jubilation.""I knew it was going to require all of my being when I came here and that proved to be true,"" Marsch told BBC Sport.""I heard a lot about Leeds United doing it hard way. Part of my job is to change that mentality to say we deserve more. We are an incredible club with an incredible team. We think we deserve what we have got.""Marsch said he could offer no guarantees about the future of any of his players, including England midfielder Kalvin Phillips and Brazil winger Raphinha, who opened the scoring with a well-taken second-half penalty.He intends to speak with the Leeds hierarchy in the next couple of days to plot a way forward.""There wasn't one day I didn't believe,"" said Marsch. ""I never talked about being in the Championship.""Leeds started the day needing to better Burnley's result to survive.When Sergi Canos levelled for a Brentford side that had already been reduced to 10 men and would be down to nine shortly afterwards when the goalscorer received his second yellow card, Marsch told some of his backroom team to stop watching Leeds and concentrate on events at Turf Moor.""I told some my coaching staff just to watch the match because I didn't need any more help with our own team,"" he said. ""We tried to communicate that. We wanted to win the game and end it so Burnley couldn't have a lucky punch to seal our fate.""Leeds escape on memorable dayMarsch proud of resolve & belief as Leeds survive relegationThe result meant Leeds became the first side since Wigan in 2011 to survive after starting the final day in the bottom three.Although the Leeds players and staff were booed by the Brentford fans for the duration of their celebrations after the final whistle, which delayed the home side's planned lap of honour, their euphoria was hardly surprising.With just two points from their last five games, the sense of trepidation among Leeds fans on their journey south was understandable.If a reminder was needed of how uncertain the final day could be, it came in a two-minute period midway through the opening half.News of Newcastle's penalty award at Turf Moor was filtering into the visiting section, which was starting to crackle with excited noise, when Joe Gelhardt buried a shot into the Brentford net.The reaction of referee Paul Tierney suggested he felt the goal would not stand and VAR duly ruled it out for offside. At almost exactly the same time, Newcastle converted their spot-kick.Even after Raphinha had kept his nerve to find the net after he had been chopped down by Brentford keeper David Raya, Leeds fan still did not allow themselves to believe the escape act was on.Canos duly brought them down to earth with his equaliser but he was booked for his celebration and then followed that up by fouling Raphinha, which wrecked Brentford's chances of turning the game around.Leeds' safety was ensured when Harrison drilled home the winner and, to their credit, Leeds' fans remained in the stands as they sang their songs of survival.Brentford's excellent debut seasonBrentford 1-2 Leeds: Thomas Frank proud of 'fantastic' Brentford seasonBrentford's first season in the Premier League has been superb.They might have missed out on a top-half finish but, as was pointed out on numerous occasions by the stadium announcer, not once have they been in the bottom three.With a bit more composure - and a full compliment of players - they might have got something out of this game.Bryan Mbeumo wasted their best two chances either side of the break and Christian Eriksen couldn't quite find his passing range.Brentford will carry on trying to persuade Eriksen to stay with them, while manager Thomas Frank will set himself the target of avoiding the kind of second season problems Leeds have only just managed to overcome.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61453546

The Hammers took the lead through Michail Antonio's blistering first-half strike but will have to settle for a place in the Europa Conference League after Brighton staged a rousing second-half comeback at Amex Stadium.""It doesn't feel like I've done a good job this season at the moment because I wanted better,"" said Moyes. ""If today was anything to go by, we have to do a lot more than I first thought.""With Manchester United losing at Crystal Palace, three points for West Ham would have secured them a return to the Europa League after losing in the semi-finals of the competition earlier this month.However, full-back Joel Veltman scored a rare goal for Brighton to level matters before Pascal Gross and Danny Welbeck completed the recovery and rounded off a record-breaking season at Brighton in style. ""We've been resilient but we weren't resilient today,"" said Moyes. ""I'm angry with the players because I'm not going to have the way they performed. When we were winning, the players didn't show that toughness and that bottle that they've had before.""We're going to be a team at the bottom of the league if we are going to keep losing goals like we have.""One game too many for the HammersBrighton 3-1 West Ham: Defeat 'puts sour taste' on Hammers' season - David MoyesThe 56th game of a gruelling season was a step too far for Moyes' men.They matched Brighton for possession with Declan Rice typically dominant, but lacked the spark to break down the rugged back four installed by Potter.Their one moment of real quality came from the boot of Antonio, although there was a whiff of controversy about it as he levered Lewis Dunk out of a challenge before ruthlessly smashing the ball past Robert Sanchez.Antonio has had a rollercoaster season, a prolific first two months followed by barren runs - this was only his second Premier League goal since New Year's Day - and David Moyes will need to bring in some support for him in the summer if West Ham intend to succeed on all fronts. He battled manfully throughout but, with top scorer Jarrod Bowen well shackled, West Ham attacks were focused down the right hand side where Vladimir Coufal was kept in check by Marc Cucurella.After Gross' goal, Moyes sent on captain Mark Noble for his 414th - and final - Premier League appearance for the club he has served so well for 18 years.He had little time to inspire a revival and his distinguished career ended with a defeat.Brighton's impressive season gets fitting finaleBrighton 3-1 West Ham: 'Fantastic' season for Seagulls - Graham PotterWith their record top-flight points tally already secured, Brighton finished the season in style with a victory against another top-eight side - after wins over Spurs, Arsenal and Manchester United in the final six weeks. Their success has been built on outstanding away form - only Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have picked up more points on the road - although two consecutive wins at home to end the season cannot mask a disappointing campaign at home.They looked toothless in the first half but a half-time tactical tweak from their impressive manager Graham Potter breathed new life into the Seagulls.In pairing Neal Maupay with Welbeck up front, he gave Brighton a twin threat that paid immediate dividends when Veltman popped up to squirm a shot under Fabianski straight after the break.Gross put them in front with 10 minutes to go when he worked space on the edge of the box to fire home before Welbeck's commanding header sealed a thoroughly satisfying afternoon in the final minute of stoppage time.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61453547
167,Burnley 1-2 Newcastle: Callum Wilson scores twice as Clarets are relegated to Championship,SUN 22 May 2022,premier-league,"Callum Wilson also scored for Newcastle in their first win of the season - a 1-0 victory over Burnley in DecemberBurnley were relegated from the Premier League on a dramatic final day as a home loss to Newcastle United condemned them to the Championship.At the start of the day, Burnley were above Leeds on goal difference, but Jesse Marsch's side won 2-1 at Brentford to end the Clarets' six-year spell in the top flight.Callum Wilson scored twice for Newcastle through a calm penalty after Nathan Collins' needless handball, then from Allan Saint-Maximin's cross.Burnley, who sacked long-serving manager Sean Dyche with eight games to go, got a goal back as Maxwel Cornet blasted in a volley after his first effort had been parried by Martin Dubravka.When Leeds' 1-0 advantage was cancelled out there was fresh hope among the Clarets fans, but their team could not force an equaliser - and the Whites' injury-time winner meant even that would not have been enough.For Burnley, then, it is Championship football next season.Relegation could spark the departure of some of their top players and - as revealed in the club's accounts - ""a significant proportion"" of a £65m loan taken out with American financiers MSD Holdings when they were taken over in 2020 will have to be repaid.The final day of the Premier League season as it happened, plus reaction and analysisVisit our Burnley pageGo straight to all the best Newcastle contentBurnley 1-2 Newcastle: Relegation will 'take a long time to get over' - Mike JacksonA miserable end to a tough campaign for BurnleySome Burnley fans were calling this the team's most important match since 1987, when they beat Leyton Orient to avoid dropping out of the old Fourth Division and out of the Football League altogether.And to lose such a match - particularly at home - was a terrible way for their time in the elite to come to an end. At full-time, some players fell to their knees before joining interim boss Mike Jackson in applauding the fans, some of whom were in tears.But the brutal truth is Burnley have not been good enough this season. They have been in the bottom three for most of the campaign having failed to win any of their opening nine games, with an 11-match winless run following soon after.To the surprise of fans, pundits and players, owner and chairman Alan Pace sacked Dyche in April, with under-23s coach Jackson given the task of keeping them in the Premier League.He had taken 11 points from his opening seven games, but his team produced a tame first half at Turf Moor as they only registered one shot on target - Dwight McNeil shooting at Dubravka from 25 yards. Burnley had earlier gifted Newcastle a 20th-minute lead when Collins stretched out his arm to flick the ball away from Sean Longstaff's head, with Wilson sending goalkeeper Nick Pope the wrong way from the penalty spot.When Wilson scored his second, free at the back post and converting Saint-Maximin's low angled pass, it looked all over before the home side finally gave their fans hope of an incredible fightback.With Leeds still drawing, Burnley produced their best football of the afternoon as Jack Cork had an effort cleared off the line by Matt Targett, before Cornet twice had efforts at goal and Ashley Barnes had a shot saved.But Burnley ended the season with the second fewest total of goals, with only bottom-of-the-league Norwich scoring fewer, and their failure to finish off their late chances saw them exit the Premier League.Following the Premier League finale on social mediaBurnley 1-2 Newcastle: Eddie Howe 'delighted' for match-winner Callum WilsonNewcastle look to the future with confidenceThe only downside for Newcastle was an injury to Brazil midfielder Joelinton, who was carried off the pitch on a stretcher after only 10 minutes.Newcastle could have scored further goals, but were frustrated by Pope who made a number of good saves, including denying Saint-Maximin when he burst clear of the Burnley defence in first-half stoppage time.For the Magpies, a turbulent season ends with them finishing in 11th, 14 points above Burnley - a performance they would not have expected after a few months.When former boss Steve Bruce was sacked in October, 13 days after the Saudi Arabia-backed £305m takeover of the club, Newcastle were in the bottom three, below Burnley.By December, and with Eddie Howe in charge, they had only seven points from 14 matches.Being able to spend £85m in January - on full-back Kieran Trippier, ex-Burnley striker Chris Wood, midfielder Bruno Guimaraes and centre-half Dan Burn (with Matt Targett also joining on loan) - helped transform their season.In their last 18 matches of the season, they secured 12 wins and one draw, and their fans will be dreaming of what the future holds.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61453542

There could be more togetherness on the pitch.""This is also important when we think of new players - when the board together with the manager are thinking about new players - that we make sure they are not only players that have the quality to strengthen the squad but they are players who will invest in the team spirit.""It was a new experience for me, not necessary coming in the middle of the season, but knowing that it would be an interim role.

The England international had more touches (63) on the ball than any other Palace player, as well as having 18 duels and winning five fouls.The victory represented a recovery from Palace's capitulation at Everton on Thursday, when they led 2-0 at half-time but lost 3-2. And they have ended the season on a positive goal difference in the top flight for the first time since 1991, keeping five consecutive clean sheets at home in the Premier League for the first time since 1992.Palace can go into the summer with plenty of promise, hoping acquisitions in the transfer market may push them towards a European position next season.Vieira said: ""It was the best way to end the season, to win the game against United because of what they represent in the Premier League.""I was really pleased because we won and we had another clean sheet at home, so a good way to end the season.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61453545

The disappointment quickly subsided, however, and the supporters soon got back to encouraging their side, playing their part by relaying the score from Manchester City's game with roars of encouragement.From then on the game was a rollercoaster of emotions with the fans - and no doubt the players - at various points experiencing hope, frustration and belief as they knew just one goal could give them the title.But although Liverpool did as they have done many times this season and found a way to win, City did likewise as they scored three goals in five minutes to take matters out of the Reds' hands.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61453543
172,Man City 3-2 Aston Villa: Pep Guardiola's side win Premier League after amazing fightback,SUN 22 May 2022,premier-league,"Ilkay Gundogan scored twice as Manchester City - 2-0 down with 14 minutes left - came back to winManchester City staged a stunning late comeback with three goals in five minutes to beat Aston Villa and win the Premier League as their title chances looked to be slipping away amid dramatic scenes at Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola's side needed victory to secure their fourth title in five seasons but were facing the prospect of ending the season empty-handed as goals either side of the interval from Matty Cash and Philippe Coutinho put Villa 2-0 ahead and in control. It looked as if Villa manager Steven Gerrard might help his former club Liverpool secure the title - until City turned the game on its head in an atmosphere bordering on hysteria. Ilkay Gundogan, on as a substitute for Bernardo Silva, gave City hope with a far-post header in the 76th minute, and Etihad Stadium was a wall of noise when Rodri drove a low finish past Villa keeper Robin Olsen two minutes later. The title-winning recovery was complete with nine minutes left as Gundogan once again arrived at the far post to put City in front, the decisive contribution on this nerve-shredding final day. Grealish thrilled to win title in 'perfect way'City did need those three points as Liverpool beat Wolverhampton Wanderers - with City boss Guardiola overcome with emotion and breaking down in tears at the final whistle. 'Man City show why they can never be called boring'Man City investigate after Villa's Olsen assaulted'Legends' - boss Guardiola praises Man City teamRelive all the final day action!Football Daily podcast: Reaction as Man City win titleMan City show grit and class of champions‘We feel legends’ - Guardiola delighted with title winWhen Coutinho slid in Villa's second goal, it looked as if the most unpalatable of storylines was being written for Manchester City. The notion of this supremely talented side ending the season with nothing was in clear view as City knew they had 21 minutes to score three times. The headlines were being written in large type with Gerrard, who never won the Premier League title during his long career at Liverpool, directing the trophy to Anfield, helped by his former team-mate Coutinho. And then, in one of the most dramatic twists of any Premier League title race, City knocked down the door that had been firmly slammed in their face by a supremely well-organised Villa. City looked crestfallen but showed their class and character once Gundogan gave them hope with that header, and they scented their chance, even though some of their fans still feared this might only be a consolation. Ilkay Gundogan had only been on for eight minutes when he scored his first, with the second coming five minutes laterRodri's equaliser was the transformative moment, a sense of inevitability sweeping around a fevered stadium, with a mixture of disbelief and elation the result as Gundogan slid home the third. Villa did not know what had hit them and had no response, supporters flooding on to the pitch when referee Michael Oliver sounded the final whistle amid a deafening din. City have had their character questioned this season, especially when they let the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid slip from their grasp, but there can be no more doubts after this. The manner in which they turned this game around with the title - and their entire season - on the line was the perfect answer. They were heading towards the most bitter disappointment but transformed this day into one they and their supporters will remember forever. It was little wonder Guardiola broke down at the conclusion of a truly remarkable afternoon.Following the Premier League finale on social mediaVilla collapse under pressureFor Aston Villa, there was nothing significant riding on the game - but the way they went about trying to win it was typical of the Premier League's competitive integrity.Gerrard and Coutinho's Liverpool connections added the sub-plot. And every part of this storyline delivered.Villa were solid, disciplined and a real threat on the break, homing in on 37-year-year-old Fernadinho as a defensive weak point for Manchester City. It worked as City, unusually flat in attack, were vulnerable at the back. When Villa went 2-0 up, it looked as if their season would end in a landmark win - and for Gerrard, the added satisfaction of seeing his beloved boyhood club win the title. Philippe Coutinho's goal briefly gave his former side Liverpool hope in the title raceAnd yet, they were over-run as the City machine suddenly hit top gear, roared forward thunderously by fans whose mood had changed from despair to expectation. The first 70 minutes at least demonstrated that Gerrard has something to build on. After that, though, Villa were simply swept aside on the tide of Manchester City's power plus the noise and emotion inside Etihad Stadium. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61453540

Spurs hammered Norwich 5-0 on the final day of the season to secure their return to Europe's top club competition at the expense of arch-rivals Arsenal. Conte said taking over from Nuno Espirito Santo in November was among the biggest challenges he had faced.""It's never positive to come into a team during the season,"" he said. ""For me it was a big challenge, maybe the biggest challenge in my career. When I stay at the top level as a coach, I wanted to prove myself in a different situation with a lot of problems to solve.

But Tottenham stayed in the hunt and seized the momentum in the race for fourth with a 3-0 win in the north London derby on 12 May, and followed that with wins over Burnley and Norwich to seal a return to the Champions League after two seasons in Europe's lesser club competitions.Conte, who has won four Serie A titles and a Premier League with Chelsea, said he believed Tottenham could finish fourth nine games ago, at the start of April.""I was very clear with my players and the media. I said, 'Now I feel we are ready and can fight until the end'. It was the perfect moment. The players know very well our schedule. We made a paper with our games and it was a fantastic run apart from Brighton.""The 1-0 loss at home to Brighton was Spurs' only defeat in that nine-game run.""We got fantastic results and now we're talking about the Champions League.

174,Everton 3-2 Crystal Palace: Dominic Calvert-Lewin winner preserves Toffees' Premier League status,THU 19 May 2022,premier-league,"Everton 3-2 Crystal Palace: 'One of the greatest nights of my career' - Frank LampardEverton secured their Premier League status with an incredible fightback where they came from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace.The hosts, who will continue their 68-year stay in the top flight, looked like they were heading for defeat after Palace scored twice in the first half through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew. But conjuring up a fighter's spirit once more and spurred on by their vociferous support, Everton turned the game around in the second half, thanks to a more attacking approach. Nine minutes after the break Michael Keane smashed in to give Frank Lampard's side hope, and when Richarlison found the bottom corner with a deflected shot with 15 minutes left, it sent Goodison Park into raptures as a precious point looked likely. Yet the best was to come with five minutes left. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who scored his first goal since August against Brentford on Sunday during an injury-hit season, sparked pandemonium with a diving header from Demarai Gray's free-kick. The excitement boiled over as fans descended on the pitch to celebrate, with blue mist shrouding the stadium as smoke flares were let off. The crucial result avoided the kind of final-day nerves that Everton fans had to experience in 1998 and 1994, where the team also preserved their Premier League status. This time, with a trip to Arsenal on Sunday, they can at least enjoy the fact that however tortuous this season has been, they will remain in the top flight, and will hope to build on the spirit shown in the closing stages of the campaign. Palace's Vieira involved in altercation with pitch invader'A special night in Everton history - but we can't be here again'Visit our Everton pageGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace contentThe party started at the final whistle, with thousands of fans flooding onto the pitch, letting off more smoke flares, saluting their team and manager Lampard. But he and the club will hope they will never have to cope with a similar scare again given lavish spending on players and a move to a new stadium in 2024. Spirit from fans and players save Everton againEverton fans ran onto the pitch when safety was confirmedLampard described this game as ""all or nothing"" given Everton's wretched away record, which has seen them win once on the road in the league since August. And despite a poor showing in the first period, where once again Everton looked inferior to their opponents, they somehow managed another second-half turnaround, which has been crucial in keeping them in the Premier League. The scenes at the final whistle were in stark contrast to those before the break where a tempestuous game boiled over on the pitch and left a livid feeling in the stands. After the introduction of Dele Alli at the break and a move to a more attacking formation, Everton matched their second-half showings against Newcastle, Leicester and Chelsea, which earned two wins and a draw. Lampard may well question why his side have to play poorly to find the inspiration, but boosted by a support which has had a massive role in their survival, they turned the game around against a Palace side which had beaten them twice already this season. Palace dominate first halfJean-Philippe Mateta scored his seventh goal of the seasonSunday's defeat by Brentford threatened to derail Everton's momentum gathered by their superior home form, but the hand that supporters have played in keeping the Toffees up cannot be underestimated. Lampard and fans tried to evoke the spirit of recent matches from the start, with the team coach greeted by a wall of blue smoke outside the stadium.  That almost boiled over early on as Anthony Gordon and Wifried Zaha squared up to each other, causing a melee, but once Palace settled they quickly picked off an Everton side who struggled to keep the ball. Lampard again favoured a 3-5-2 formation, but when his side retreated into a back five, Patrick Vieira's visitors were able to enjoy plenty of possession and control the game.There were moments in first half for Everton's fans to get excited about, like Richarlison's free-kick that hit the bar. But for the most part the passionate home support turned to anger as Mateta scored his seventh goal of the season before helping to create Palace's second. Everton 3-2 Crystal Palace: Vieira feels 'frustration' after defeatThe fact it came from Ayew was contentious. He had hacked down Gordon shortly before but only received a yellow card and was then on hand to take advantage as both Vitaliy Mykolenko and Abdoulaye Doucoure somehow failed to connect with the ball on the line following Zaha's shot.  That silenced the crowd, who must have felt like relegation was staring them in the face. But a half-time switch to a back four by Lampard, who replaced the ineffective Andre Gomes with Alli, breathed life into Everton. Nine minutes after the break, Keane fired in after Mykolenko's free-kick was headed back to the centre-back by Mason Holgate. And with 15 minutes left, Everton managed to conjure up another goal. Alli had a hand in it, crossing the ball, but when the Palace defence failed to clear Richarlison's shot ended up in the bottom corner, setting off wild celebrations. That seemed minor compared to Calvert-Lewin's winner. Everton fans could not contain their delight, running onto the pitch, with Zaha seeming to take issue with some supporters' attentions. The pitch was eventually cleared, but there was little hope for the stewards as thousands celebrated with their heroes at the final whistle.

While Jackson's side entertain 12th-placed Newcastle at the weekend, Leeds are at 11th-placed Brentford.""The least we wanted was a point, we're a little disappointed not to get the three,"" he said after Burnley ended a two-match losing run.""Everything I've seen tonight is what this group does. They've had to dig in, they've had to work. We'll need it again on Sunday.  ""It's not mission accomplished."" Ashley Barnes' well-taken penalty put the Clarets in front just before half-time.However, Villa were the better side and the least they deserved was the draw given to them by Emiliano Buendia's equaliser in the 48th minute.Burnley's position would have been even better had Wout Weghorst not somehow failed to convert after being set up by Connor Roberts, whose own effort had been brilliantly saved by Emiliano Martinez.The visitors were the ones defending desperately at the end though after substitute Matt Lowton was sent off in stoppage time - barely five minutes after coming on after catching Calum Chambers with his follow-through as he over-stretched to win the ball.Reaction from Aston Villa-Burnley, plus the rest of Thursday's Premier League gamesGo straight to all the best Villa contentVisit our Burnley pagePope keeps cool to save battling ClaretsAston Villa 1-1 Burnley: Not yet 'mission accomplished' for Clarets - Mike JacksonThe perceived wisdom is that Burnley have an advantage in the survival battle because they have been down this road so many times before.The reality is they have never gone into the final day with their top-flight future at stake.What they do have is home advantage in addition to their position in the table which, thanks to one strike of the ball, is markedly better than it was at kick-off.Even though Maxwel Cornet was brought down by Buendia for the spot-kick, there was no chance of the Ivorian taking it after his miss at West Ham last month.Barnes kept his nerve despite a slight delay and found the bottom corner as Martinez went the wrong way.There was no doubting goalkeeper Pope was their man of the match, though, as he repelled Villa on at least half a dozen occasions. The one-handed effort to turn away Bertrand Traore's second-half strike was superb and, as Villa pushed on for the winner, the England keeper twice prevented Danny Ings from putting the home side ahead.While Tyrone Mings' block to turn Weghorst's late shot wide was superb, he shouldn't have been given the opportunity to keep the ball out.If that had gone in, Burnley would only have needed a point on Sunday. As it is, Jackson needs his side to get three to be certain of completing a most unlikely escape act.Can Villa deny Man City?Aston Villa 1-1 Burnley: 'Outstanding' Nick Pope denied Villa victory - Steven GerrardAlthough it would take an unlikely sequence of results on the final day, Villa could still secure their first top-10 finish since 2011.However, most attention for them will centre around whether they can shake up the Premier League title battle.As with many teams at this time of the campaign, Villa's issue is maintaining focus. The good news for second-placed Liverpool, given the massive favour they need from Steven Gerrard and his team at leaders Manchester City, is they have not relocated to the beach just yet.They were the better side in the first half, with John McGinn drawing two excellent saves out of Pope.And it was the Scot who delivered the precise pass through the Burnley defence that created Buendia's equaliser.Evidently, the Clarets do not have the luxury of bringing on a substitute in the class of Philippe Coutinho or Ings, as Villa were able to do in the final stages.Like their manager, both players have Liverpool connections.Neither was able to fashion a winner in this game and the red half of Merseyside will hope they were saving their heroics for Sunday at Etihad Stadium.""We have little time to prepare for the Manchester City game,"" said Gerrard. ""We'll try to make it as difficult as we can for them and we will fight for everything we can.""We will try to give it our best shot and make our supporters proud on the last day of the season.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59618476

177,Southampton 1-2 Liverpool: Takumi Minamino and Joel Matip goals take title race to final day,TUE 17 May 2022,premier-league,"Liverpool are on 89 points after 37 Premier League matches, with leaders Manchester City on 90Liverpool have taken the Premier League title race down to the final day of the season by coming from behind to win at Southampton. Jurgen Klopp's side knew defeat would hand the title to Manchester City - while even a draw would effectively end the challenge because of their inferior goal difference. And it looked as if Liverpool might have a struggle on their hands when Nathan Redmond gave Southampton a 13th-minute lead with a curling right-foot shot beyond Alisson. Liverpool, with nine changes from the side that won the FA Cup by beating Chelsea on penalties at Wembley on Saturday, once again showed their resilience and reserves of strength as Takumi Minamino levelled before half-time with a thumping drive against the club where he spent a spell on loan last season. The pressure built after the break and Liverpool took a deserved lead after 67 minutes when Joel Matip sent an instinctive looping header over Saints' keeper Alex McCarthy. City will still retain their title with victory over Aston Villa at Etihad Stadium but Liverpool have pushed them all the way again and ensured the fight will go down to the wire. Southampton v Liverpool as it happened, plus reaction and analysisWatch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayerVisit our Southampton pageGo straight to all the best Liverpool contentLiverpool dig deep againSouthampton 1-2: Jurgen Klopp praises 'unbelievable' Liverpool performanceLiverpool were under pressure going into this game - and not just because they could not afford a slip.Manager Klopp had to make a host of changes because of tired legs following that gruelling FA Cup final win and also had to contend with injuries to major figures Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. This was a test of the nerve as well as the depth of Liverpool's squad and, as at Aston Villa last week when they also fell behind, an examination of their ability to survive adversity and demonstrate powers of recovery. All the tests were passed in convincing style as Liverpool dominated once they had recovered from shock of Redmond's outstanding goal. In the absence of Salah and Sadio Mane, and with Luis Diaz on the bench, Roberto Firmino gave an outstanding display of touch and intelligent running, putting in a tireless shift that earned him a standing ovation when he was substituted late on. Ibrahima Konate has proved to be an outstanding signing and he was once again a tower of strength in defence, ensuring Liverpool did not miss Van Dijk - his defensive partner Matip scoring the winner with what looked almost like a reflex action header, albeit a highly effective one. The only blot on Liverpool's night was an injury to the luckless Joe Gomez, who fell awkwardly under a touchline challenge and limped off disconsolately at half-time with the consoling arm of goalkeeper Alisson around his shoulder. Klopp delivered his tradition triple fist pump in front of Liverpool's travelling fans at the final whistle. He will know City are still in pole position and have the title's destiny in their own hands but all Liverpool could do was put them through a final-day test and this was mission accomplished. Southampton run out of steam Southampton 1-2 Liverpool: Defeat by Liverpool 'frustrating' - Ralph HasenhuttlSouthampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl was hoping for a vibrant display from his side after feeling the full force of fan discontent following their 3-0 defeat at Brentford last time out.The Austrian faced chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'sacked in the morning' during the dismal defeat in west London on 7 May.This was a tame response, ending as he led his team around a largely deserted stadium on a lap of appreciation after the final whistle. Saints had the boost of that early lead but never carried the air of a team confident it would be maintained. Liverpool confirmed their obvious superiority while the home side looked nervous, especially when playing out from the back, where they played themselves into trouble on several occasions. Southampton lie in 15th place, nearing the end of the season in which moments of promise were eventually overshadowed by disappointment. This is exactly where they finished last season and they have to win at Leicester City on Sunday to equal last term's points tally. Now Hasenhuttl will hope to keep hold of star man James Ward-Prowse this summer and get some much-needed financial backing from the club's new owners, the company backed by Serb media mogul Dragan Solak.

It was no surprise he was involved in the opener as White turned the ball into his own net as he attempted to prevent the Newcastle forward from getting a shot off.Arteta was unable to hide his frustrations with the officiating against Spurs - a match in which his team conceded a penalty and had defender Rob Holding sent off - but he can have no complaints here as they were undone by a side who simply showed more hunger and quality.Newcastle 2-0 Arsenal: Eddie Howe pleased with 'aggressive' Newcastle",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61375035
179,Tottenham 1-0 Burnley: Harry Kane penalty sends Spurs into fourth place,SUN 15 May 2022,premier-league,"Kane's penalty against Burnley was his 16th Premier League goal of the seasonHarry Kane's penalty saw off a stubborn Burnley side as Tottenham moved above Arsenal into fourth place and kept the Clarets' survival hopes in the balance.On a tense afternoon in north London with so much at stake at both ends of the table, Kane's spot-kick in first-half stoppage time proved enough to give his side three vital points in their bid for Champions League football.Spurs move two points clear of the Gunners and will stay above them going into the final day of the season unless their north London rivals beat Newcastle at St James' Park on Monday.Burnley started and finished the game fourth bottom, but fell to 18th and into the relegation zone following Leeds' draw with Brighton later on Sunday.The Clarets had to survive some intense early pressure but began to find their way into the game before it swung on Tottenham's penalty, awarded on the stroke of half-time.Davinson Sanchez's attempt to flick on a ball in the Burnley box saw the ball brush against Ashley Barnes' outstretched arm.Referee Kevin Friend did not spot the incident and Harry Kane went close to turning in a Ryan Sessegnon pull-back as play continued, before VAR intervened.After consulting his monitor, Friend pointed to the spot and Kane made no mistake, planting his penalty into the bottom corner.That was not the end of Burnley's threat, however. Clarets keeper Nick Pope made two brilliant saves from Son Heung-min after the break to keep the game in the balance, and his side almost levelled when Ashley Barnes fired against the post.By the end, the home fans were imploring Friend to blow the final whistle as Burnley pumped balls into their box in the closing seconds, and they got their wish as Spurs held on for an important victory.What's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?Reaction from Spurs v Burnley and the rest of Sunday's Premier League actionVisit our Tottenham pageGo straight to all our Burnley contentSpurs get the job doneTottenham Hotspur 1-0 Burnley: Champions League spot is not in our hands - Antonio ConteThis Spurs performance brought none of the euphoria that had greeted their win over Arsenal on Thursday but they dug in to ensure it brought the same result.They got it despite four of their players suffering from a stomach bug - goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who played the 90 minutes, plus his deputy Pierluigi Gollini, winger Dejan Kulusevski and midfielder Harry Winks who were all on the bench. Tottenham's bid to finish fourth is still not in their own hands but they have put the pressure on the Gunners now, with only seven days of the season to go.The way Antonio Conte's side started the game, it appeared they would overwhelm the Clarets, who did not even manage a touch in the Spurs area until the 25th minute.But Pope saved from Kane, who also saw a goal-bound header hooked clear by Nathan Collins and Burnley began to create chances of their own.The visitors wasted a good opportunity to take the lead when Maxwel Cornet ran clear but fired weakly at Hugo Lloris, but they remained resolute at the back and Spurs' frustration continued to grow - until VAR handed Kane the chance to make the breakthrough.Burnley have work to doTottenham 1-0 Burnley: Spurs penalty decision 'doesn't make sense' - Mike JacksonThe Burnley bench understandably reacted angrily when Tottenham were belatedly awarded the penalty that undid all of the Clarets' good work in the first half.Michael Jackson's side had arrived with a game plan to defend in numbers and pack their own box and, after surviving that frantic start, it seemed to be working.They did a decent job at chasing the game too and caused Spurs some problems in the second half - notably from set-pieces - but for all their industry, Barnes' effort from distance was still the closest they came to an equaliser.After taking 10 points from his first four games in charge, caretaker boss Jackson has now lost two games on the bounce.His side still have a game in hand over Leeds, their closest relegation rivals, as well as a vastly superior goal difference - but they go into the final week of the season with their fate still uncertain.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61368199

Striker Ollie Watkins, a doubt for the game after sustaining an ankle injury against Liverpool in midweek, had beaten Guehi to Lucas Digne's cross after 69 minutes to put the hosts ahead with his first attempt.""We're a little bit frustrated,"" Gerrard said. ""It was a good battle. With the chances we created, you expect to score more than one goal. We've conceded naively on a set play so we have ourselves to blame.""The Villa boss added: ""We need to be more ruthless and clinical. We are creating good chances and we're playing really well but we are conceding stupid goals. ""There are a lot of areas we need to improve and I am sure we will be a lot better come next season.""Danny Ings twice went close inside the opening eight minutes for Villa, shooting wide following a darting run to the near post, and volleying over from Joachim Andersen's attempted clearance. Palace offered a positive response, but Wilfried Zaha's stinging strike was parried by Emiliano Martinez and the Villa goalkeeper was also equal to Nathaniel Clyne's low effort. Despite a late flurry of chances, with Watkins firing wide in added time, neither side could find a winner to improve their chances of securing a top-half finish. Palace dropped down one place to 12th following Brentford's victory over Everton, three points behind 10th-placed Brighton, with Villa still one place and one point behind the Eagles.

Likewise, Steven Gerrard's Villa are chasing a first top-10 placing in the Premier League since 2010-11, but those hopes have taken a blow heading into their final two games.The hosts were unable to capitalise on an encouraging start, as Ings failed to hit the target with three decent first-half chances - also curling wide after being teed up by strike partner Watkins.It was Martinez who was the busier goalkeeper, but the Argentine was alert to well-struck attempts by Zaha and Clyne.Aston Villa 1-1 Crystal Palace: Patrick Vieira 'happy' with a point at VillaA largely uneventful start to the second half saw Matthew Cash flash an uncontested ball across the six yard box, while the Villa right-back was required to block Tyrick Mitchell's strike shortly before Watkins' opener.Palace felt aggrieved that Watkins was not penalised for a foul on Guehi as the pair battled for Digne's cross, but Schlupp's near-immediate impact ensured Vieira's side did not depart empty-handed after an even encounter.""I'm really happy with the performance,"" Vieira said. ""It wasn't easy to concede that goal and we didn't deserve to concede that goal.""The Palace boss added: ""We showed quality and character to fight and to find the strength to get back in the game and score.""Philippe Coutinho, who failed to shine following confirmation of his permanent move from Barcelona this week, was among several players to see late efforts blocked by committed defending at both ends.Villa now host relegation-threatened Burnley on Thursday and title-chasing Manchester City on the final day, while Palace travel to Everton before hosting Manchester United next Sunday.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61368174
181,Leeds 1-1 Brighton: Jesse Marsch makes survival pledge after late Pascal Struijk goal,SUN 15 May 2022,premier-league,"Struijk headed level and then raced to celebrate with Leeds' fansLeeds manager Jesse Marsch says his side will ""invest everything"" in a final-day push for Premier League survival after Pascal Struijk's injury-time equaliser secured a vital draw against Brighton.Marsch's side toiled at a raucous Elland Road but looked to be edging nearer to relegation after Danny Welbeck coolly finished to give Brighton a deserved first-half lead.But the home support defiantly roared Leeds on and Brighton keeper Robert Sanchez brilliantly denied Mateusz Klich in each half, while also turning away a Raphinha free-kick as pressure built.Leeds striker Joe Gelhardt had gone close early on but his persistence was rewarded at the death when he bundled space in the area to lift a ball across goal, where substitute Struijk nodded home before diving into home supporters in celebration.It means Leeds move a point above the bottom three with just a trip to Brentford remaining, while Burnley drop to 18th but have two games to play and a substantially better goal difference.""The point shifts the pressure a bit,"" Marsch said after the frenetic draw. ""This is a psychological battle we are in. What you see is we are put in difficult situations and the resolve of our team. ""We need to be able to show that at the beginning of matches too. It is a fight. Nothing comes easy for us. We seem to dig holes and then have to find a way to dig out. We are ready.

But this scrappy Struijk header could prove priceless as it means Burnley now travel to Aston Villa on Thursday knowing a defeat would mean it is Leeds who have Premier League survival in their own hands on the final day.In recent weeks, Marsch's side have arguably fallen foul of playing with too much emotion. Red cards in a defeat at Arsenal and at home to Chelsea proved crucial and screamed of a side playing on the edge in their quest to secure top-flight status.They started with conviction and were unfortunate when Gelhardt saw a goal-bound shot cleared off the line by a team-mate as the effort struck Liam Cooper's face.But too often Leeds played in a frenzied, sometimes desperate way, forcing passes and snatching at openings with frequency as they found the target just five times with 19 shots on the day.Crucially, they used the emotion of the day positively late on to snatch something. They clocked 5km more in distance covered as a team and 20 sprints more than Brighton - evidence of a response to the passionate support on offer.Only Manchester City - on nine - have scored more goals than the seven Leeds have managed in added time this season and Marsch deserves praise for his changes and for keeping his side so positive. Leeds deserved the point for their second-half improvement, though they had come close to being finished off moments before equalising when Welbeck headed wide from six yards. On such fine margins seasons can turn and Leeds can only hope this memorable late leveller will indeed prove significant.Impressive Brighton let points slip  Welbeck took his first-half goal cleverly by lifting the ball over Illan MeslierNot for the first time in recent weeks, Brighton offered a mix of craft and quality, especially in a first half that saw Solly March fire wide when one-on-one and Pascal Gross force a save when well placed.The side that beat Wolves by three and Manchester United by four in recent weeks were simply too poised for Leeds early on, constructing passes in the home half while Marsch's side played with far more panic.Welbeck turned Diego Llorente two ways before flicking the ball over home keeper Illan Meslier for a fine opener having picked up a pass from the impressive Yves Bissouma.Bissouma completed 91% of his passes on the day but was equally adept without the ball as he made more clearances than anyone in a Brighton shirt.Late substitute Tariq Lamptey pulled an opening wide moments after Leeds had levelled but Brighton boss Graham Potter will likely be frustrated in dropping points so late on. In truth his side waned after the break and were pegged back by a team who found the kind of sharpness that so often materialises when everything is on the line.Leeds 1-1 Brighton: Seagulls 'needed a second goal' to seal win - Graham Potter",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61368181
182,Watford 1-5 Leicester City: Jamie Vardy scores twice as Foxes condemn relegated Watford to defeat,SUN 15 May 2022,premier-league,"Jamie Vardy has scored 26 goals against promoted teams since the start of 2014-15Jamie Vardy scored twice as Leicester thrashed already relegated Watford to consign them to a seventh defeat in eight Premier League games.The result boosts the Foxes hopes of a top-10 finish, with Watford, who have now lost 15 of their 19 home matches, remaining just above Norwich at the bottom of the table.With Roy Hodgson's successor Rob Edwards paraded before kick-off, the afternoon had started brightly for the Hornets. Joao Pedro's close-range effort deflected off Timothy Castagne to put them in front, and they had opportunities to extend their lead with Adam Masina hitting the crossbar and Brazilian forward Pedro seeing another effort well saved by Foxes goalkeeper Danny Ward.However, a defensive mix-up between Masina and Craig Cathcart allowed Youri Tielemans to tee-up James Maddison for the equaliser, and from there the Foxes took control. Another misjudgement, this time from goalkeeper Ben Foster, saw Vardy beat him to the ball to head in Leicester's second before Harvey Barnes guided Marc Albrighton's cross into the bottom left corner 22 seconds after the break. While Pedro twice further seriously tested Ward, Watford's dismal day saw Vardy race on to Barnes' pass to prod the ball past Foster, before Barnes compounded their misery, sweeping a low effort past Foster into the bottom right corner late on.What's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?Follow all Sunday's Premier League actionVisit our Watford pageGo straight to all the best Leicester City contentWoeful WatfordRelegated Hornets 'architects of own downfall' - Roy HodgsonThis felt like an occasion for Watford to try and finish their final home match of a wretched season with a flourish.However, they delivered a disappointing display which did anything but lay an optimistic foundation for next term's Championship campaign, their performance only underlining the scale of the job in front of Edwards as he watched on from the stands.Pedro's early effort had provided the perfect start as they attempted to record their first victory at Vicarage Road since the 4-1 humbling of Manchester United in November. But from the moment Leicester equalised they capitulated, with some hapless defending contributing to them becoming the first club to lose 15 home games in a Premier League season. ""We were architects of own downfall,"" Hodgson said. ""Bad mistakes led to the goals. When you analyse the goals we conceded, there isn't a lot good you could say. Crass individual errors and we find ourselves on the end of a very bad defeat.""We've had the worst home record in all the leagues. You need your wins at home. The fans are entitled to be frustrated and upset with us and to make their opinions heard.""Hodgson's side have also conceded 46 league goals at home this term, the most by any top-flight team since 1960-61. It represented an embarrassing send-off for Hodgson at Vicarage Road and for Foster, who also appears set to leave the club this summer.Vintage VardyJames Maddison was 'sensational' - Brendan RodgersWhile the pre-match focus was on goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel's omission after 149 consecutive league appearances, by the end it was another of Leicester's 35-year-olds who had taken the headlines.For the second game running Vardy scored twice, becoming the first Leicester player to do so in the Premier League and the second-oldest player ever after Youri Djorkaeff to accomplish that feat in the competition.His first was all about anticipation, running clear of the last defender to reach Maddison's lofted ball before Foster and glancing his header into an unguarded net. His second was another typical Vardy effort, running into the channel to collect Barnes' pass before sliding his shot past Foster. By then Leicester's early woes of conceding a 16th top-flight goal from a corner were long forgotten.""It was a fantastic win,"" said Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers. ""It's never easy at this stage of the season when people think you have nothing to play for. I'm proud of the players. They turned up and they were hungry right to the end. I thought the attacking part of our game was outstanding.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61368173
183,West Ham United 2-2 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola's side keep title race in own hands,SUN 15 May 2022,premier-league,"Jack Grealish's goal was his third for Manchester City in the Premier League this seasonManchester City came back from two goals down for the first time under Pep Guardiola to earn a point at West Ham that means victory over Aston Villa on the final day will see them crowned champions.City's grip on the Premier League title was looking distinctly shaky at the break as the Hammers led thanks to Jarrod Bowen's well-taken double.But Jack Grealish struck for the visitors four minutes after the re-start and Vladmir Coufal headed Riyad Mahrez's free-kick into his own net as City avoided defeat after coming back from two goals down in a top-flight game for the first time since 2012.They even had a chance to win it five minutes from time but Lukasz Fabianski saved Mahrez's penalty after Craig Dawson had fouled Gabriel Jesus.Guardiola looked devastated at that. But given the situation they found themselves in at the break, with Liverpool potentially having the chance to catch them when they play on Tuesday, the final outcome was positive for the visitors.It certainly was for West Ham, who have qualified for European football through their league position in successive seasons for the first time in their history.What's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?Follow reaction to West Ham v Man City and the rest of Sunday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best West Ham contentVisit our Manchester City pageWest Ham 2-2 Man City: Premier League title race is 'in our hands' - Pep GuardiolaCity drag themselves out of troubleIt is a measure of the success Guardiola has had in this stadium that his first five visits all yielded victories - and a staggering total of 22 goals.Now City have drawn on three successive visits - losing on penalties in the Carabao Cup earlier this season.In the week they signed Erling Haaland, they found it impossible to hold West Ham's number nine, Michail Antonio, and were unsettled by Bowen's direct running.Without Grealish's volley from Rodri's knock-down flicking off Craig Dawson's leg and over Fabianski, they might have been in for a very fraught second half.As it was, they dominated possession and put the Hammers defence under so much pressure, it felt inevitable an equaliser would come. That Coufal provided it was unfortunate as the Czech did not have to dive at Mahrez's free-kick, which Fabianksi seemed to have covered.Mahrez blew the opportunity to avoid a nervy final day - but, 10 years after Sergio Aguero's famous injury-time title winner, City fans do at least know that anything can happen if events start to conspire against them again.Europa Conference joy for West HamJarrod Bowen has scored 12 Premier League goals this season, and has assisted another 12This has been an excellent season for West Ham - with European qualification being welcomed by manager David Moyes, even if it ends up being the Europa Conference League.Bowen, a Premier League player of the year nominee, has been one of the stand-out stars.The former Hull man showed an impressive turn of pace to run on to Pablo Fornals' hooked long pass, sprint round Ederson and finish from an acute angle.Bowen showed composure also when he ran on to Antonio's through ball and found the net again.West Ham 2-2 Man City: David Moyes 'couldn't believe' Hammers were 2-0 up at half-timeHowever, had he pulled a cross back rather than try to score from an impossibly narrow angle shortly after Grealish had breathed new life into the game, West Ham might have got a rare home win over City.Antonio also fluffed his lines when Fernandinho's woeful back-pass sent him through, chipping wide of Ederson and the City goal.Hammers stalwart Noble says farewellMark Noble will leave West Ham at the end of the season, having made 567 appearances for the club in all competitionsMark Noble was 17 when he made his Hammers debut.Born in Canning Town and growing up only a mile from Upton Park, Noble has been a fan all his life and other than short loan spells at Hull and Ipswich early in his career, has played for the club through the intervening 18 seasons.West Ham were determined to make the most of Noble's final home game. His face adorned the side of the stadium, clearly visible on the walk up from the Westfield centre. A cake in his honour was left in the media room, with members of the press also given a letter from Noble thanking them for their support throughout his career.The front page of the programme was dedicated to Noble, a distinctive number 16 shirt was laid on the pitch before the game, supporters applauded throughout the 16th minute. Under the circumstances, it was hardly a surprise he was fighting back the tears as he came out to take the acclaim just before the teams emerged from the tunnel.Moyes trusted Noble enough to bring him on near the end as West Ham secured their point, before Noble received the acclaim of virtually a full stadium that waited to hear his final farewell long after the whistle had gone.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61368175
184,Wolves 1-1 Norwich: Canaries hold Wolves to drab draw,SUN 15 May 2022,premier-league,"Wolves had lost six of their last nine home gamesWolves' hopes of European qualification were extinguished as already-relegated Norwich City held them to a frustrating draw at Molineux. Rayan Ait-Nouri rescued a point after an improved second-half performance by the home side, but it is now just one win from their last seven games.Because of West Ham's point against Manchester City in London, Wolves can no longer reach the Europa Conference League for next season.Teemu Pukki gave the Canaries an early lead, but they weren't able to hold on for a final away victory of the season.Wolves 1-1 Norwich City: Too easy to score against us - Bruno LageThere was an end-of-season feel to the game from the start, with both sides lacking form and purpose. Pukki fired wide after being released by a perfectly-weighted pass from Kieran Dowell, before John Ruddy denied him with a fine save moments later. Toti's well-timed challenge stopped Dowell as he closed in on a tap-in from the rebound.Wolves dominated possession but were frustrated by Norwich's robust defence for much of the first half.Their only chance of real note came after half an hour, when Raul Jimenez's cross was headed over by Hwang Hee-chan.Eight minutes before the break, it was third time lucky for Pukki. He cut in from the right and created a sight of goal before wrong-footing Ruddy for his eleventh goal of the season.Booed off at half-time, Wolves came out fighting and levelled 10 minutes after the restart. Joao Moutinho's free-kick caused chaos in the area, eventually finding its way for Ait-Nouri to head home.The mood changed instantly. Chiquinho, a half-time change for the hosts, was causing all sorts of problems and Norwich suddenly looked vulnerable at the back. Pedro Neto nearly put Wolves ahead, only to be thwarted by Angus Gunn. Bruno Lage's side hunted the winner but were unable to make their dominance count, and he was left frustrated by his side once again conceding first in a match.""We are frustrated with the result. It has been easy to score goals against us in the last months,"" Lage told BBC Sport.""We tried to do our best. We changed the dynamic a bit, scored one and should score more. It is a draw, it is not good for us and me. I wanted a good performance and result for the fans who supported us this season.""Sometimes the games are balanced and we are suffering first and conceding first, even when the opponent is doing nothing.""Today, we are controlling the game, we tried to find our spaces to play. We are missing some players; it is easy to find spaces against our defence and it is hard for me to be in this moment.""What's on the line in the final week of the Premier League season?Visit our Wolves pageHere is all our Norwich contentWolves rally but can't find breakthroughIt was a much improved second-half display from Wolves as they looked to end their season on home soil with a flourish.The introduction of Chiquinho made a real difference and they began to find more space in key areas than before, with Norwich looking much less resolute.But ultimately, Lage's side perhaps won't be sad to see the back of Molineux for the time being as they failed to turn around a drab home record, having won just three of their previous nine in Wolverhampton.Canaries hold on but rue early missesWolves 1-1 Norwich City: Draw at Wolves 'stops the bleeding', says Dean SmtihThere was a reaction from Norwich here, after a difficult few weeks which confirmed their return to the Championship. The heart was evident again, but perhaps the quality wasn't.It could have been very different had Pukki made good on those opportunities in the first half, and Dean Smith will no doubt be disappointed with the manner of the goal they conceded.Smith admitted his frustration with Pukki's finishing but was pleased with the way his side defended overall.""We had three wonderful chances,"" he said. ""Teemu has been put through a number of times. I thought defensively we restricted them to not many chances at all.""It was a really good, workmanlike performance but I'm disappointed we haven't got all three because we could have been more than a goal up at half-time.""[The equaliser] was preventable because it wasn't a free-kick. Unfortunately we have decisions like that go against us week in, week out. We are disappointed by that.""We wanted to stop the bleeding today; we've been conceding too many goals and too many big chances. I thought we did that today. Second half, we were careless on the ball and didn't keep it as well as we did first half. We thoroughly merited the point.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61368178
185,Everton 2-3 Brentford: Nine-man Toffees miss chance to secure Premier League survival,SUN 15 May 2022,premier-league,"Rico Henry's second-half header deepened Everton's relegation fears and earned Brentford their seventh victory in ten league gamesEverton manager Frank Lampard says his side have been ""on the wrong end of a lot of bad decisions this season"" after the nine-man Toffees were beaten by Brentford at Goodison Park.Leeds' draw at home to Brighton earlier on Sunday meant victory for Lampard's team would have secured their top-flight status with two games to spare, but the narrow loss leaves them just two points clear of 18th-placed Burnley and one above Jesse Marsch's side, who have played a game more.Dominic Calvert-Lewin got the faintest of touches to Richarlison's flick to give the hosts an early lead, but the dismissal of teenage defender Jarrad Branthwaite - which came moments after Richarlison's appeals for a penalty for a foul by Kristoffer Ajer were turned down - swung the momentum back in the visitors' favour.""When you see that shirt pull [on Richarlison], that's a foul anywhere on the pitch,"" said Lampard, who is facing an FA hearing over comments made in the aftermath of last month's 2-0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield.""This 'clear and obvious' phrase, I don't know if it still counts but I think it's a nonsense. The decision is either right or wrong.""Is a shirt pull a foul? Yes. Is it in the box? Yes.

Arsenal could have confirmed a place in the Premier League's top four with a win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium but endured a dismal night to now stand only one point clear of Spurs with two games left. In a feverish atmosphere, Harry Kane gave Spurs the lead from the spot in the 22nd minute after Son Heung-min was fouled by Cedric Soares, then added a second before the break with a stooping far-post header after Rodrigo Bentancur flicked on a corner. In between, Arsenal had been reduced to 10 men when Rob Holding was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Son, while the South Korean finished off any hopes the Gunners had when he fired in from 10 yards two minutes after half-time.

Conte's team look so impressive, organised and solid in defence with the deadly pair of Kane and Son a permanent menace in attack. Spurs have two eminently winnable fixtures remaining at home to struggling Burnley and at relegated Norwich City while Arsenal must travel to Newcastle United - no easy task these days - before a final home fixture against Everton, who may yet be fighting for survival. Conte has brought the best out of this Spurs side by implementing his trademark fierce tactical discipline while still getting the most from those two outstanding forwards, who have been augmented by impressive January signing Dejan Kulusevski. As Spurs flourished and Arsenal wilted, it made for a celebratory atmosphere among a record crowd of 62,027 inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs are still the hunters but they have a real chance of making the top four to round off some fine work by Conte, who took over an out-of-sorts side in eighth place when he succeeded sacked Nuno Espirito Santo in November.

Mikel Arteta's side were never given the chance to settle and once Kane put Spurs ahead it was all downhill, with Holding's needless sending-off making an already difficult task impossible. The late hamstring injury to key defender Gabriel only added to their suffering but the positive for Arteta and his players is that their destiny remains firmly in their own hands. If Arsenal win their next two games they will be in next season's Champions League. The more difficult aspect is that, given Spurs' fixtures, the likelihood is that they may well have to win at Newcastle United on Monday to keep their ambitions on track. Arsenal are so close and looked to be in pole position just a few weeks ago, so to miss out now would be a huge disappointment, especially as they have not had any European football to distract them from the job of finishing in the top four. Arteta must ensure his players put this experience behind them but there is no doubt this defeat has put Arsenal under serious pressure befofe their visit to Tyneside, where manager Eddie Howe will want to round off Newcastle's season at St James' Park in style after moving them clear of relegation trouble with plenty to spare.

We give up an early goal and go down a man again - deja vu,"" Marsch told BBC Sport.""We don't get a chance to stay in the game and see if we can test ourselves and come away with more. We lose another player. ""Two tackles in the last two games that were a little bit crossing the line and hurting the team. I'm not going to blame or finger point any of our players. They've given everything they can. We have to stay within boundaries in not jeopardising ourselves.""Leeds also became the first team to ever receive 100 yellow or red cards in a Premier League season.Mount scored the game's opening goal with a lovely first-time effort from outside the box from Reece James' cut-back at the end of a nice passing move.Kovacic had to be replaced because of an ankle injury following the foul by James. ""It looks swollen and painful. It's the same ankle he had injured already. It doesn't look good,"" said Blues boss Thomas Tuchel.Pulisic slotted Mount's pass into the bottom corner from 20 yards.Lukaku - who earlier had a goal disallowed - scored the third goal that the Blues' dominance deserved as he took his time to hold off three defenders and smash home.Leeds offered very little and their hopes of staying up are out of their hands. They are behind 17th-placed Burnley on goal difference and two points off Everton, and have played a game more than both.Chelsea only need to beat one of Leicester or Watford - or hope Tottenham do not win all three remaining games - to clinch a place in next season's Champions League.

That was their third red of the season (on top of a record 97 yellows) and their second in four days.Leeds now need to get something from games with Brighton and Brentford - without Ayling or James - and hope Burnley or Everton slip up above them. Leeds have conceded 37 goals in their home league games this season, their second worst ever record in a top-flight campaign.They could perhaps deal with those struggles better if they were scoring more goals - but they only had five shots at Elland Road, none on target.Job almost done for Chelsea'Very strong' Chelsea deserved to win - TuchelChelsea, who have been comfortable in third place for most of the season, looked to be cruising towards the Champions League places but a run of three games without a win might have seen a tiny bit of doubt creep in.They could be guaranteed a top-four place by the time they go to Wembley on Saturday if Spurs do not beat Arsenal on Thursday.Thomas Tuchel's side were deserved winners and could have scored more, with Lukaku having six shots alone.The Belgian continued his revival with his third goal in two Premier League games.

188,Leicester City 3-0 Norwich City: Jamie Vardy scores twice as hosts claim comfortable win,WED 11 May 2022,premier-league,"Jamie Vardy has scored three league goals since the turn of the yearJamie Vardy scored twice as Leicester condemned relegated Norwich to a fifth consecutive Premier League defeat.Vardy's double ensured the Foxes ended their own seven-game winless run in all competitions and sees them move up to 10th in the table.It was no more than Brendan Rodgers' side deserved as they dominated possession, although they struggled to make a breakthrough until Vardy's opener, which deflected off Norwich defender Grant Hanley before looping over visiting goalkeeper Angus Gunn.Harvey Barnes, who created Vardy's first, also supplied the second for the 35-year-old, who timed his run to perfection before firing into the top left corner. As Leicester moved through the gears, James Maddison blasted an effort into the roof of the net against his former employers, with Gunn unfortunate to see the ball into his path after failing to collect Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's cross.Dean Smith's side offered plenty of resistance until falling behind and arguably had the best chance before Vardy broke the deadlock, with Teemu Pukki first-half effort against the post. However, once they fell behind they wilted and have now conceded 78 goals this term - their worst defensive performance in a top-flight season.Follow all Wednesday's Premier League actionGo straight to the best Leicester City contentVisit our Norwich City pageNorwich's familiar failingsNorwich could not match Leicester tempo - SmithIt has been a largely joyless season for Norwich supporters who, apart from one fleeting week, have seen their side rooted in the bottom three for all the campaign. While this was a marked improvement on Sunday's 4-0 home defeat by West Ham, like so many other performances this season it followed a narrative of what might have been - with Smith able to point to the huge deflection that saw them fall behind and several wasted opportunities at the other end.Having repelled a brief Leicester flurry, Dimitris Giannoulis, Pukki and 19-year-old winger Tony Springett, making his first start for the Canaries, all had chances to put the visitors in front but were denied by excellent goalkeeping from Kasper Schmeichel. However, they have only scored 22 league goals all season, and although Pukki hit the post, they failed to register a shot on target after the break.""I thought we were as good as them in terms of chances created in the first half but when the first goal goes in, we could not chase the game,"" Smith said.""We know we are going to come up against teams with more possession and when we concede first, we suffer. We showed some good stuff in the first half but Jamie Vardy's movement for his two goals was exceptional and that is what you are up against at this level.""Vardy steals the show'Dominant' second half delights RodgersHaving started the season looking to build upon their FA Cup success of last term, Rodgers' side began the evening closer to the relegation zone than the European places, which are now out of reach.But had Vardy not spent large chunks of the season nursing injuries, their end-of-season prospects may have been significantly enhanced.""He [Vardy] was outstanding tonight, his physicality, his running and pressing,"" said Rodgers.  ""The second goal was classic really. We worked it really well and Jamie does what he does.""With the veteran forward, Maddison and Barnes restored to the starting XI, it felt as if normal service had resumed after a sequence of poor results.Vardy was a constant threat and had already tested Gunn after ghosting into the left channel before opening the scoring. His enduring quality was evident with his emphatic second and he had more shots and more touches in the opposition penalty area than any other player.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59787806
189,Watford 0-0 Everton: Toffees' Premier League fate remains in balance after draw,WED 11 May 2022,premier-league,"Watford won the reverse fixture against Everton 5-2 in OctoberWatford ended a club record run of 11 successive home defeats and Everton moved a point closer to Premier League safety after a dismal game at Vicarage Road. Everton had the better openings but were wasteful against relegated and injury-hit Watford, who named former Forest Green manager Rob Edwards as their next head coach before kick-off. This was an opportunity missed by Everton, with Demarai Gray wasting their best chance by shooting inches wide while Watford keeper Ben Foster saved well from Richarlison's deflected shot. Everton, however, were aided in their battle to avoid the drop by Leeds United's heavy home loss to Chelsea and now have home games to come against Brentford and Crystal Palace. They are two points ahead of Leeds, who remain in the bottom three and have played a game more.Watford had little to play for other than avoiding another loss as manager Roy Hodgson's reign comes to a close but this was a grim encounter that will not linger in the memory. Reaction to Watford v Everton, plus the rest of Wednesday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Watford contentVisit our Everton pageEverton have supporters to thankWatford draw 'a point gained' - LampardFor Everton, the highlight of the night was another show of magnificent travelling support from fans who have taken ownership of the crisis facing the club in a remarkable mobilisation that has played a huge part in their recent recovery. As at Leicester on Sunday, the away section provided a thunderous soundtrack throughout, even setting aside the desperately meagre fare on the pitch to back Everton from the first minute until the last. Manager Frank Lampard was quick to show his appreciation at the end and he has formed a bond with Everton's fans that has not existed since Roberto Martinez's successful first season. It has certainly not been seen before under the reign of owner Farhad Moshiri. Toffees fans, realising the serious danger of relegation, set aside their protests at years of bad decision-making at boardroom level inside Goodison Park to back the side and, if they do stay up, the club should be eternally grateful for their unswerving loyalty. A missed chance this may have been, but Everton's fate is in their own hands - and survival looks a lot more likely than it did before taking seven points from three games. ""I wouldn't say I'm frustrated. I think if you can't win, you don't lose, and we were more than secure in the game,"" said Lampard.""If you ask me, I'd much rather be the team that's got it in your hands and a point or two more on the board and maybe a game more than someone as well, so I think that probably in that situation that's what you want, but the pressure is huge anyway.""For all the talk about pressure, more or less, it's only actions at this point. It's how we act and how we perform in these games.""Watford look to the future Hodgson 'proud' of Watford performance in Everton drawThe cheers that rang around Vicarage Road at the final whistle were an almost ironic celebration of Watford ending that awful sequence of home losses, but it was a show of satisfaction nonetheless. To the credit of the Hornets supporters, they threw their backing behind Watford with passion and good humour throughout the whole game and deserve something to celebrate, even if it hardly qualifies as consolation. Hodgson is on the way out after failing to save them from the drop and Edwards will be the latest incumbent of the Vicarage Road hot-seat after moving from Forest Green to help them build back from the Championship. It will be, no doubt, another summer of churn at this club but one thing they can count on is their excellent fans, who have stood by Watford even in this awful season. Hodgson said: ""I think it was a sterling effort from the players. The players have been doing the work with us and there was an enormous honesty about our performance.""They played with an integrity and honesty that was really encouraging. Your confidence can never be high after being relegated. I was expecting a far worse performance than the one I saw and I can only congratulate the players for their performance against a side with a lot still to play for.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60724994

Again, he played a part in the build-up too, and was in the right place to smash in the rebound after Jose Sa beat Raheem Sterling to his pass.His third goal - again with his so-called weaker left foot - was the pick of the bunch, and saw him drive towards the edge of the area and curl into the bottom corner.De Bruyne's hat-trick was his first for City and at 24 minutes was the third-quickest in Premier League history.He celebrated in style by copying the meditation celebration of his soon-to-be team-mate Erling Haaland, who City reached an agreement to sign this week, but he was not finished yet.City came out for the second half looking for more goals to improve their goal difference, which was already three better than Liverpool's before kick-off.Raheem Sterling thought he had extended their lead when he ran clear and beat Sa but an offside flag cut short his celebrations.It was left to De Bruyne to make it 4-1, typically making no mistake when a Phil Foden cross was deflected into his path and finding the bottom corner with his first right-footed effort of the night.More chances followed, with Foden hitting the post and Sterling missing an easy chance but eventually someone else did get in on the act, with Sterling tapping into an empty net after Sa denied Joao Cancelo.This was still the De Bruyne show, however. City are not over the line yet, and their next test is an awkward trip to West Ham on Sunday, but on this evidence they will take some stopping.Follow live text commentary of Wednesday's Premier League actionVisit our Wolves pageGo straight to all the best Manchester City contentLaporte injury is a cause for concernThis was a night to savour for Guardiola and City's travelling fans but the one note of concern was the sight of Aymeric Laporte and Fernandinho being forced off with an injury in the second half.City may have bolstered their attack for next season with their agreement to sign Borussia Dortmund striker Haaland but it is defence where they are short right now.With Ruben Dias, John Stones and Kyle Walker already out injured for the season and Nathan Ake not fully fit,Guardiola chose to put veteran midfielder Fernandinho in his back-line alongside Laporte at Molineux.Wolves were set up to make the most of any lack of pace in City's rearguard and, initially, looked dangerous whenever they broke forward.When Dendoncker's equaliser came via that route and left the home fans in raptures, it seemed Wolves would ensure City were in for a difficult night. De Bruyne had other ideas, however.A good game for Lage to missWolves boss Bruno Lage was absent from the dugout after testing positive with Covid, and communicated with his coaching staff by phone.One can only imagine he attempted to get the message across on a number of occasions that they should try to stop City's number 17, but the task was beyond any of his players.De Bruyne almost added a fifth goal for himself before the end, and the only surprise was that he fired against the post on that occasion rather than finding the corner of the net.He had done little else wrong all night, and was rightly serenaded by City's jubilant supporters when he celebrated with them at the final whistle.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61055884
191,Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool: Sadio Mane winner keeps Reds title hopes alive,TUE 10 May 2022,premier-league,"Sadio Mane has scored nine goals in 10 games against Aston VillaLiverpool maintained the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City as they survived an early scare to come from behind and win at Aston Villa. Jurgen Klopp's side suffered a shock after only three minutes when Douglas Luiz bundled home after Liverpool keeper Alisson failed to hold his header.Liverpool were on terms within three minutes when Joel Matip scored following a goalmouth scramble and the sides then exchanged chances before Sadio Mane put the visitors ahead with a superb angled header from Luis Diaz's cross in the 65th minute. The win means Liverpool now lie second only on goal difference before City's visit to Wolves on Wednesday. Former Liverpool striker Danny Ings wasted opportunities to equalise and inflict a blow to his old club's hopes of winning a historic quadruple - although the Reds did suffer an injury setback when influential midfielder Fabinho went off in the first half with a hamstring problem that must make him doubtful for Saturday's FA Cup final against Chelsea.'Mane shows again why he is indispensable'Go straight to all the best Aston Villa contentAll the latest Liverpool newsLiverpool pass stern Villa testLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp made five changes from the side that drew with Spurs at Anfield on Saturday, resting tired legs and freshening things up with Saturday's Wembley showpiece in mind. It was a ploy that worked in the end, although Liverpool were set back on their heels when they were punished for a slow start as Villa went ahead. Liverpool showed their character and the threat they carry to reply instantly and, while this was not a particularly assured performance, the only thing that matters at this stage is the final result, and this was a case of job done. The injury to Fabinho will be a serious worry to Klopp with FA Cup and Champions League finals on the horizon but he will hope the Brazilian's swift removal in the first half will limit the damage. Once again January signing Diaz was a key figure, a danger all night and the provider of the cross that brought Mane's decisive header. The Colombian's signing has proved to be a masterstroke. Now the scenery switches to Molineux on Wednesday, where leaders City face Wolves, who still have European aspirations of their own.  Pep Guardiola's side still have that advantage on goal difference but Liverpool's win at least ensures they stay right on Manchester City's shoulders as the season reaches its climax. Aston Villa 1-2 Liverpool: Klopp says victory over Villa is 'massive'Gerrard with work to doAston Villa will finish the season in a comfortable mid-table position but so much of this term has been about manager Steven Gerrard discovering what he has at his disposal then laying the groundwork for next season. He has talent in the shape of Emiliano Buendia but big decisions remain about whether he will strengthen in defence - where captain Tyrone Mings still looks suspect - and on the possibility of a permanent deal for his former Liverpool colleague Philippe Coutinho. The Brazilian, on loan from Barcelona, only showed his ability in flashes here and it was clear the Villa fans felt more of a surge of hope when he was replaced by Buendia. Gerrard certainly has something to work with but a lot needs to be done and he is a driven personality who will not want to cruise along in mid-table. Villa, and Ings in particular, had plenty of opportunities to take advantage of some uncharacteristic uncertainty in the visitors' defence, with keeper Alisson fortunate to get away with one or two moments of poor judgement - although he then made a crucial save from the striker when he broke clear with a chance to equalise. The end of the season will be the end of Gerrard's fact-finding mission and the serious reconstruction will begin at Villa Park.

192,Arsenal 2-1 Leeds United: Gunners take control of top-four race,SUN 08 May 2022,premier-league,"Eddie Nketiah has scored nine goals in all competitions this seasonArsenal took a huge step towards securing Champions League football next season as they saw off an ill-disciplined Leeds United, with the 10-man visitors dropping into the Premier League relegation zone.It was a fourth successive win for Mikel Arteta's side and one that puts them firmly in the driving seat for a top-four spot before Thursday's north London derby at Tottenham.But Leeds' early capitulation was entirely of their own making, with goalkeeper Illan Meslier gifting the hosts an opener before captain Luke Ayling was sent off for a needless lunge on Gabriel Martinelli.Eddie Nketiah pounced on Meslier's loose touch to open the scoring and then finished a swift move to double the Gunners' lead before Ayling's rash challenge left Leeds a man down for more than an hour.The Elland Road outfit did not have an effort on goal until Diego Llorente headed past Aaron Ramsdale in the 66th minute to tee up more of a nervy finish than anyone inside Emirates Stadium would have anticipated. Leeds applied some late pressure, sending Meslier up for set-pieces, but the fourth-placed hosts were never seriously in danger of losing their lead and now hold a four-point lead over Tottenham in fifth.Defeat for Leeds, coupled with Everton's win at Leicester, means Jesse Marsch's side slip into the bottom three with three games remaining.Leeds 'must fight for their lives' - MarschFollow Sunday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Arsenal contentVisit our Leeds pageGunners take charge of top-four raceEddie Nketiah played 19 times on loan for Leeds in the 2019-20 seasonWith Spurs drawing at Liverpool on Saturday, Arsenal knew if they could successfully navigate this potential stumbling block they would head into one of the most crucial north London derbies in recent years on Thursday with a commanding lead over their rivals.The hosts were handed the ideal start when Meslier took a loose touch from Ayling's pass and allowed Nketiah to pounce for the opener - a reward for both his persistent pressing and recent performances leading the Arsenal line.The 22-year-old's forward's future is yet to be determined, with his contract expiring in the summer, but Nketiah has continued to do his bit to make sure Arsenal are playing in Europe's elite competition next term, and doubled the hosts' lead with a well-taken second from Martinelli's pass in the 10th minute.That was the forward's ninth goal this season, although five of those have come in the Carabao Cup, where he was used most frequently before earning a first Premier League start of the season last month and establishing his place in Arteta's first XI.Now the soon-to-be-free-agent is spearheading a young and exciting Arsenal forward line alongside Bukayo Saka and Martinelli, who was on the end of a foolish tackle from Ayling that resulted in the defender being dismissed after 27 minutes.Arsenal's flowing attack toyed with the visitors as Martin Odegaard's free-kick found its way onto the bar and Martinelli poked a half-volley over, only for the Gunners to be caught out from Leeds' first corner.It made things slightly less comfortable than Arteta will have hoped for but his side got the vital win they needed before a trip to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where victory will confirm Arsenal's return to the Champions League for the first time since 2016-17. Leeds on the brinkOn top of Ayling's sending off, Leeds received two yellow cards to take them to 96 this season - more than any side in Premier League historyLeeds looked to have turned a corner under new boss Marsch, collecting three wins in a five-game unbeaten run before being humbled 4-0 by league leaders Manchester City last time out.That might have been enough to drag them to safety were it not for recent revivals from Burnley and Everton, but Marsch's side now find themselves on the brink of a return to the Championship.The American must have watched on in disbelief as Meslier took a poor touch in his six-yard box to allow former Leeds loanee Nketiah to open the scoring after five minutes.He will have been even more dumbfounded by captain Ayling, on his 500th career appearance, diving in on Martinelli when the visitors were trailing 2-0.The defender was initially shown a yellow card, but VAR recommended referee Chris Kavanagh look at the pitch-side monitor and he upgraded it to red. Raphinha almost followed the Leeds skipper for his reaction and the visitors threatened to unravel as home fans taunted them with chants of ""you're going down"". Despite their numerical disadvantage, Leeds rediscovered some defensive solidity and made their first opportunity at the other end count when Junior Firpo flicked on a corner for Llorente to score.Rodrigo had a chance to snatch a draw in stoppage time but could not get enough on his header, leaving Leeds 18th, level on points with Burnley and one behind Everton but with a far worse goal difference, as they finish the day in the bottom three for the first time since October.

A stunning volley by Vitaliy Mykolenko and Mason Holgate's header gave Frank Lampard's side their third win in five games and ensured they remain in control of their destiny with four games to play.Mykolenko finished superbly from Alex Iwobi's cross after six minutes but Patson Daka capitalised on Yerry Mina's attempted header back to Jordan Pickford to draw Leicester level five minutes later.The unmarked Holgate was quickest to react after Kasper Schmeichel kept out Richarlison's initial header from a corner to restore the Toffees' lead after 30 minutes.Forced to chase another equaliser, Leicester dominated for large periods in the second half - but they found England number one Pickford once again in inspired form.Having made one of the saves of the season against Chelsea last Sunday, the Toffees goalkeeper produced sublime stops to deny Nampalys Mendy and Harvey Barnes to protect his side's narrow lead.Everton moved up to 16th with victory, one point above Burnley and Leeds United, who lost 2-1 at Arsenal to drop to 18th.The Toffees have played one game fewer than their relegation rivals.""We had a plan and the players stuck to it, no matter what happened, no matter if they scored,"" Lampard told BBC Sport.""It's far from done, but the players can be really happy with what they've done on the pitch today. We should enjoy the result - but we're by no means safe.""Defeat extends Leicester's winless Premier League run to five games and leaves Brendan Rodgers' side 14th in the table.Reaction to Leicester v Everton, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League actionHolgate embodies attitude required - LampardPickford helps Everton move another step closer to safety'A great feeling' - Lampard joy at Everton winEverton began last Sunday a concerning five points behind Leeds and Burnley but, roared on by the Goodison Park crowd, recorded a crucial victory over Chelsea to stay within striking range of the sides above them.Now, consecutive league wins for the first time since September - accompanied by defeat for Leeds at Arsenal and Burnley's loss to Aston Villa - mean Lampard's side will have the chance to go four points clear of them at already-relegated Watford on Wednesday.The visitors, who had taken just six points away from home all season, made a nervous start in defence and Mina executed a superb sliding block to deny Daka after only two minutes.Withdrawn midway through the first half because of injury, Mina was at fault as his header back towards goal was pounced on by Daka - a mere 15 seconds after Abdoulaye Doucoure had seen his shot pushed onto the post at the opposite end.But the visitors responded positively to the setback as Holgate capitalised on the Foxes' well-known weakness from set-pieces - despite Schmeichel's best efforts.'My responsibility' - Rodgers takes blame for Leicester defeatMidfielder Anthony Gordon typifying the fight and determination that has underpinned Everton's recent upturn in form with driving runs in an attempt to ease the mounting pressure in the second half.Denied a place in the Europa Conference League final by Roma on Thursday, Leicester have been left to pursue a top-half finish as they attempt to end a disappointing league campaign on a positive note.However, their winless run extended to seven in all competitions as Pickford prevented Mendy's strike finding the top corner, before keeping out Barnes' low attempt among seven vital saves.Rodgers said: ""We have shot ourselves in the foot so many times this season. That is my responsibility. The confidence in the team in dealing with set-piece situations isn't there.""I think back to where we were - and three years on we're disappointed not to win a trophy this season.

194,Norwich 0-4 West Ham: Visitors keep top six dream alive with rout,SUN 08 May 2022,premier-league,"West Ham are now three points behind sixth placed Man Utd with a game in hand.West Ham are ""desperate to get back into Europe"" according to manager David Moyes, who saw his side's hopes of qualifying for the Europa League strengthened by thrashing already-relegated Norwich. The win - thanks to Said Benrahma's double, Michail Antonio's strike and a penalty from Manuel Lanzini - puts the Hammers just three points behind sixth-placed Manchester United in the final Europa League spot, with a game in hand. They also have the added security of being in pole position for the Europa Conference League should they miss out on the Europa League, sitting five points clear of closest-rivals WolvesAnd Moyes said that his side have had their appetite whetted for further European football despite the disappointment of their midweek defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League semi-finals.""We are desperate to get back into Europe. We've had an unbelievable experience,"" Moyes told BBC Sport. ""It isn't something West Ham have had regularly, and not for a long time. The supporters enjoyed it and we had a great trip. We are trying to get into the Europa League or Conference League.""Moyes admitted he was concerned that his side may not be at their best after their exertions in midweek but praised his players' application.""It was big that we turned in a good performance and result after one of the biggest disappointments we've all had in a long time,"" he added.""Any manager would think there is a chance of a hangover because you never know the way football is. We set the tone in the first 20 minutes and got a goal in that period as well. ""The players did a really good, professional job. We could have played better and on another day we might have scored more. We've missed regular goals in the past few months.""Norwich, meanwhile, seemed devoid of inspiration in front of an angry home crowd as costly errors proved their downfall.It took just 12 minutes for the Hammers to solidify their strong start with the opener. Jarrod Bowen fed Benrahma on the left after a swift attacking move, and he fired a deflected shot under Tim Krul, who really should have done better.Norwich's defensive frailties were in evidence again as Antonio made it 2-0 on the half hour mark. Bowen's reverse pass appeared to have been dealt with by Grant Hanley, but Krul collided with his captain to allow the striker a tap in to an empty net.Space was far too easily afforded to West Ham and they should have punished Norwich again immediately. Benrahma had all the time in the world to pick out a cross, and, with players queuing up to score, Bowen somehow fired wide from point-blank range.However, he picked himself up and registered another assist, picking out Benrahma once more. The Algerian rifled a shot past a helpless Krul on the stroke of half time.Norwich thought they had pulled one back through Sam Byram just after the restart. Lukasz Fabianski failed to catch a corner and the defender turned it home, only for it to become immediately apparent through VAR that the ball had hit his arm.VAR intervened at the other end 25 minutes from time when Jacob Sorensen handled in the area, allowing Lanzini to step up and convert from the spot.West Ham bounce back stronglyIt could have been easy for Moyes' side to fold after the disappointment of Thursday night, so their focus was impressive.It may not have been the toughest of tests against opponents playing only for pride, but West Ham showed their intent as they started as they meant to go on, utilising the space and hurting the home side out wide.Benrahma was one of two changes for the game and he could have had a hat-trick to further delight the travelling fans, whose buoyancy showed there is still much achieve this season.Norwich going down with a whimperThe season cannot end soon enough for the Canaries. It is the third season in a row that promotion has been followed immediately by relegation, but there was a greater sense of animosity in the air.The home crowd's displeasure was clear at half-time and although there was a mini resurgence in the second period it did not last long. History suggests Dean Smith's side will have a good go at promotion next season, and the fans will be desperate for that to be the case.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61288435
195,Man City 5-0 Newcastle: Man City three clear of Liverpool in title race,SUN 08 May 2022,premier-league,"Manchester City secured a fourth Premier League win in a row with the help of Rodri's sixth goal of the seasonManchester City shrugged off the disappointment of their Champions League semi-final exit at Real Madrid to sweep aside Newcastle United and open a three-point lead at the top of the Premier League. The reigning champions took advantage of Liverpool's draw with Tottenham Hotspur with an impressive response that not only strengthened their position at the Premier League summit but also markedly improved their goal difference. Chris Wood wasted a glorious early chance for Newcastle to add to City's nerves and his side paid the price when Raheem Sterling headed Pep Guardiola's team in front after 19 minutes. Aymeric Laporte added a second before half-time after Newcastle keeper Martin Dubravka fumbled Ilkay Gundogan's volley and Rodri made sure of the victory with a near-post header from Kevin de Bruyne's corner just after the hour mark. City, with Newcastle deflated and outclassed, improved their goal difference even further when substitute Phil Foden struck in the closing moments, turning in Oleksandr Zinchenko's touch, before Sterling completed the rout with a close-range finish in added time.'Man City answer all questions after Real despair''Everyone supports Liverpool' - GuardiolaMan City show steel and styleCity faced plenty of pre-match questions about their character and the potential response to losing a place in the Champions League final that they held in their hands until Real Madrid's astonishing late comeback at the Bernabeu. The manner of this win, and its wider significance, provided the perfect answer. There were a few nerves around Etihad Stadium at the start and Newcastle striker Wood might have made them jangle even more had he not delivered a weak finish from Allan Saint-Maximin's cross in the opening exchanges.He not only directed a tame header straight at Ederson but arguably robbed Joelinton of an even better opportunity as the Brazilian lurked behind him. City, in contrast, showed all their class in attack and once Sterling put them ahead it felt as if there was only ever going to be one outcome. It was a performance and result designed to lift their spirits and puts City in pole position to retain their title given they lead by three points with three games to play - and this handsome victory moves them from one behind to four ahead of Liverpool in terms of goal difference. The closing stages were played out as a formality with City in total control, the only cloud on their day the half-time substitution of key defender Ruben Dias.However the addition of those two late goals gives City a potentially key cushion should they falter in any of their final games. And Guardiola, an agonised figure in Madrid, was more buoyant as the action unfolded, even demanding a standing ovation for Gabriel Jesus from City's fans when he was substituted, a request that was duly answered. City have their destiny in their own hands, with away games at Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Ham United to come before a final-day home game against Aston Villa.Newcastle given brutal lessonNewcastle are a club fuelled by high finance and huge ambition after their Saudi Arabian-based takeover but this was another chastening lesson in the scale of the gulf between where they are and where they want to be. Liverpool delivered lesson one at St James' Park last week and City rammed home the message by outclassing a Newcastle side in the early stages of a rebuild under manager Eddie Howe. Newcastle showed one or two early signs of promise but their current standing was illustrated in this match as they were over-run by a City side simply operating on a different level - although they are hardly alone there. The travelling Toon Army were in fine voice throughout and there is clearly understandable optimism around Tyneside but this must be tempered by the realism that there is no quick fix or easy route to what they hope will be their final destination. City were utterly dominant and the final scoreline was a realistic reflection of just how far behind Newcastle are as they start their journey forward. Manager Howe has done well to guide them to a position of safety in the Premier League with weeks to spare when relegation was once a realistic prospect - now even more significant work awaits in the summer.

The Denmark midfielder has been on the winning side in six of his eight starts for the club.But Thomas Frank's side have been equally impressive defensively, keeping clean sheets in five of their last six home matches, including the last four in a row - making them just the fourth side to have such a run this season after Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City.This result was never really in doubt after their quickfire early double, with Jansson doing well to divert the ball into the net after Toney had chested Eriksen's high, hanging corner to the far post.Eriksen was involved in the second goal too, and when referee Michael Salisbury played the advantage after the Dane was fouled, Wissa picked up the loose ball and curled it into the corner.The Bees killed off any remaining Saints resistance with 11 minutes left thanks to Ajer's fine turn and finish, and the hosts were able to comfortably see out the match.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61281251

Boehly, who also co-owns the LA Dodgers baseball team, was present in west London to witness his first game as the prospective new buyer and stood to applaud when Ruben Loftus-Cheek hooked in from close range after Marcos Alonso's corner pinballed around the box and found the midfielder via Lukaku's knee in the first half.But the American businessman, sunglasses on and coffee in hand, could do nothing more than shrug after VAR took a considerable amount of time to rule the goalscorer offside.Tuchel said beforehand the Boehly deal was ""good news"", but that his side did not need any extra motivation to bounce back from the defeat by Everton last Sunday, and they had already had an attempt from Timo Werner ruled out for a foul on Romain Saiss before Loftus-Cheek's effort.Werner began in attack alongside Lukaku, who was handed his second league start since February after Tuchel said the forward was ""a very important part of the squad next season"". All five of Lukaku's top-flight goals since his £97.5m summer move from Inter Milan had come in 2021 and the striker's only touch in the opening 15 minutes of this game was a blocked shot inside the Wolves box.But he became more of a presence as the match unfolded and, after outmuscling Saiss, was then brought down just inside the box by a clumsy challenge from the Wolves defender.Lukaku converted the penalty himself to put Chelsea in front in the 56th minute for his first league goal of 2022 and soon added his second with a clever first-time right-foot finish from Christian Pulisic's pass.""OK, good performance but this is for sure not the moment to talk about individual performances and praise individual players,"" said Tuchel when asked about the striker afterwards.""We do this as a team and we lost points, crucial points. This is not the moment to praise individuals.""Victory would have virtually guaranteed Chelsea's presence in next season's Champions League, but Tuchel's side showed their vulnerability - 13 of the last 15 league goals they have conceded have come in the second half - and their winless run in the Premier League now stretches to three games. ""At some point we played like we were 2-0 down not 2-0 up,"" added the German. ""I don't think we were too deep, I think it was the opposite, and then we tried to respond to it and change the structure.""So I don't know if that was the right decision from me, I need to watch it again. But in general it's a lack of execution, of discipline and execution of the match plan throughout the whole half.""Romelu Lukaku scored his first Premier League goals since a 1-1 draw with Brighton on 29 DecemberWolves show character in comebackWolves' promising first season under Bruno Lage was in danger of stumbling to an unsatisfactory finish, but the manner of this draw will have lifted the mood at Molineux.With 11 minutes of normal time remaining, the visitors were staring at a fourth successive defeat without scoring a goal.But Trincao's superb curling effort from outside the box gave Wolves hope and they then had a flurry of chances to level before Coady rose highest to head Chiquinho's cross beyond Edouard Mendy and spark huge celebrations in the away end.Boss Lage had to watch from home after returning a positive Covid test, but his side's substitutions proved crucial with both goalscorer Trincao and Chiquinho, who got both assists, brought on with Wolves 2-0 down.With three games remaining, Wolves still have the chance to secure European football next term but must navigate a tricky run-in that includes both Manchester City and Liverpool.  ""Bruno Lage was in touch and we had a chat at half time over Zoom,"" said goalkeeping coach Tony Roberts.

Defeat by Burnley last week had left the Hornets 12 points adrift of safety with four games remaining and Palace sent their former manager Roy Hodgson's side straight back down to the Championship with a dominant display. The Eagles controlled the contest from the outset and went ahead when Zaha confidently swept his 31st-minute spot-kick past Ben Foster after Hassane Kamara had used his arm to block Michael Olise's back-post header. Watford never looked like scoring and their misery was compounded when Kamara, already booked for that handball, was dismissed when his push on Olise produced a second yellow card.Ben Foster criticises team-mates' attitudes after relegationFollow all of Saturday's Premier League games It is the second time Watford have dropped out of the top flight in the past three seasons.

The identity of the coach who will be tasked with emulating Munoz's achievement is still unknown, however, with Hodgson set to retire from top-level management when his contract at Vicarage Road expires at the end of the season.

France Under-21 winger Olise, one of five players recalled by Eagles boss Patrick Vieira, created the home side's first chance after five minutes when Marc Guehi headed his teasing cross over the bar.Olise was also involved in the first-half's key moment when his header from Eberechi Eze's left-wing cross struck Watford full-back Kamara's outstretched arm.Graham Scott pointed to the spot, and while Kamara claimed Olise had pushed him in the back, a VAR review upheld the referee's decision, allowing Zaha to add to the double he netted in Palace's 4-1 win over Watford in February. While Watford needed to score twice, it was Palace who looked like grabbing the game's second goal with Odsonne Edouard almost netting a superb solo goal just after the hour, dancing his way through the visitors' defence before hitting the post from a tight angle.

Son Heung-min swept the counter-attacking visitors in front after 56 minutes following a link-up between Harry Kane and Ryan Sessegnon and with the Liverpool defence disorganised. Liverpool naturally flooded forward for an equaliser but it took a heavily deflected shot from Luis Diaz 16 minutes from time to pierce Spurs' packed defence and draw the home side level.

Klopp's team has set magnificently high standards but it was inevitable they would not be able to find a way to win every time and they were up against a side brilliantly organised by visiting coach Antonio Conte. Liverpool swarmed over Spurs from the start but once the early storm blew over they could not carve out many clear openings against a resolute defence, in which Cristian Romero was absolutely outstanding.Klopp vows Liverpool will 'keep going'Virgil van Dijk struck the woodwork before the break - as did Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - as Liverpool frequently threatened from set-pieces but Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane were kept largely quiet, and were after the break too.Diaz was the main threat, as he arguably has since he arrived in January, and the Colombia winger deserved his goal even if it was helped by a big deflection off Rodrigo Bentancur. Liverpool were roared forward by a Kop desperate for another piece of late Anfield drama but too many crosses went astray and too many moves foundered on the rock of the Spurs defence. Klopp's side have relentlessly pursued City in the past two months knowing any slip-up would be damaging and after these dropped two points must now hope Guardiola's side lose rather than merely draw one of their remaining games in order to reel them in.

Spurs had a rough ride early on as Liverpool, lifted by reaching the Champions League final and boosted by a buoyant Anfield, tore into the visitors but came through that and showed qualities that have been witnessed in patches since the Italian's arrival. They were fiercely well-disciplined and their ability to rise to the occasion is proved by the fact they have now come through their four league meetings with Liverpool and Manchester City undefeated this season. Spurs showed two sides to their game as they were outstanding in defence but also carried a serious threat on the break, creating enough chances to perhaps regret not getting three points. Son's goal showed exactly what Spurs were all about as Kane controlled the ball brilliantly, passing up the chance to shoot and instead playing in Sessegnon, whose cut-back was finished off by the South Korea forward. In the context of the chase for a place in the Champions League, Conte will curse how Hojbjerg passed up a golden opportunity in the dying seconds.  Nevertheless the performance will give them heart going into Thursday's potentially decisive north London derby at home to Arsenal. They are now in fifth place, one point behind the Gunners having a played a game more.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61281249
202,"Man Utd 3-0 Brentford: Fernandes, Ronaldo & Varane score in morale-boosting win",MON 02 May 2022,premier-league,"Only Mohamed Salah (73) and Harry Kane (65) have been involved in more Premier League goals than Bruno Fernandes (61 - 36 goals & 25 assists) since he made his Manchester United debut in February 2020Manchester United recorded the biggest win of Ralf Rangnick's reign in his final home match as interim boss as Brentford were beaten at Old Trafford.A brilliant opener from Bruno Fernandes was followed by a second-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane's first United goal as the hosts cruised to victory.Ronaldo also had a goal disallowed as he moved onto 18 Premier League goals, four behind Golden Boot leader Mohamed Salah.The result keeps alive United's slender hopes of Champions League qualification at least until next weekend, while Brentford could still go down, even though their 40 points is almost certainly enough to retain their status as a top-flight club.For the third game running, home fans protested against the club's owners, but while there were plenty of anti-Glazer family chants and green and gold flares in opposition to the Americans, the mooted 73rd-minute walkout did not materialise in any significant number.Mata's fond farewellUnited's victory moved them on to 58 points with two games remaining, meaning they still have the chance to match their tally from the 2013-14 campaign under David Moyes, which is their lowest since the 59 they struggled to in 1990-91.This was actually one of their better displays, helped in no small part by Juan Mata, who was making his first league start of the season in what was probably his last match at Old Trafford.Mata could have had an assist to go with his precise passing and invention, only for Ronaldo to be judged marginally offside after he had scored from the veteran Spain international's pass.Ronaldo got his goal anyway, sending Brentford keeper David Raya the wrong way from the spot after the Portuguese had been fouled by Rico Henry.That doubled a lead given to the hosts by Fernandes.With a contract to 2026, Fernandes is one of the pillars of incoming manager Erik ten Hag's United.His first goal since February was a beauty, slamming home Anthony Elanga's cutback with a first-time volley.Raphael Varane's deflected shot brought United their third - and with the protest not gaining the anticipated momentum, there were still plenty of fans in the stadium as the home players went on their post-match lap of appreciation for a season that most connected with the club cannot wait to end.Big decision awaits for EriksenThis was only Christian Eriksen's ninth match for club and country since his return from the cardiac arrest he suffered while playing for Denmark against Finland at the European Championship in June 2021.Yet the Dane has already done enough to show he can operate at a level above Brentford.Within 10 seconds of kick-off, he had lifted a pass over the United defence that threatened to create an opportunity for Bryan Mbeumo before Victor Lindelof came across to cover.It was a pin-point curling Eriksen cross that Ivan Toney headed over from a central position, a deep free-kick at the start of the second half that the striker was unable to keep on target and a long-range free-kick from the Dane that David de Gea had to palm away.Eriksen's contract runs out in the summer, although it does contain an option to extend it for a further year.The big question is whether the 30-year-old repays Brentford - and Thomas Frank's faith in offering him a way back into the game - and commits to another season or he accepts an offer from a bigger club, which will surely come his way.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61212449
203,Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Richarlison winner boosts strugglers' survival hopes,SUN 01 May 2022,premier-league,"Richarlison's winner has moved Everton to within two points of safetyEverton moved to within two points of the Premier League safety zone with a priceless win over Chelsea that was inspired by a thunderous atmosphere at Goodison Park.Starting the day in the relegation places, five points behind Leeds and Burnley, the hosts were lifted by their fans in their attempt to extend a 68-year stay in the top flight.Everton's aggressive pressing was eventually rewarded a minute after the break when Richarlison dispossessed Cesar Azpilicueta on the edge of the area and scored his ninth goal of the season. The Brazilian celebrated by picking up a smoke flare that had landed on to the pitch and throwing it back towards the stands.Vitalii Mykolenko could have doubled the lead soon afterwards but skewed wide, and Everton were indebted to two stunning saves from Jordan Pickford to keep themselves in front. First, the Everton keeper denied Azpilicueta after Mason Mount's shot hit both posts and spun out. From the resulting corner, Pickford then took Antonio Rudiger's shot fully in his face, needing medical treatment.It was an incredible effort from the England stopper, who also saved from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but typified Everton's approach as they dug in to thwart Thomas Tuchel's side, even if that raw approach drew complaints from the German.Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon could have made the game safe late on, but Frank Lampard saw his side hold out against his former employers, to earn only his fourth win in 13 Premier League games in charge.The victory was vital, reducing the gap behind Leeds and Burnley, with the Toffees having a game in hand on their relegation rivals. Chelsea, meanwhile, will rue the fact they could not turn their possession into goals, with their preparations hampered by fireworks being set off during the night outside their hotel. Tuchel said they had not affected his team, but was left to reflect on a defeat that could harm their chances of finishing third after Arsenal climbed to within three points of Chelsea by beating West Ham. Everton earn famous win with full-blooded approach Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Everton put on outstanding display - Frank LampardIf Everton and their fans were attempting to rattle their opponents, it worked, for what could prove to be a crucial step towards safety.With so much at stake, once again the supporters helped boost a struggling but spirited team to earn a third win in four home matches, which will be key to their chances of survival.Chelsea's build-up had been disrupted, with midfielder Jorginho admitting he was woken by the fireworks outside the Chelsea hotel on Saturday night.Before kick-off, thousands of Everton fans lined the streets outside Goodison Park, attempting to lift the mood that had been dampened by relegation rivals Burnley's 2-1 victory at Watford on Saturday. And in a full-blooded match, that noise helped set the tone as the hosts tore into their opponents with an aggression which was met with approval from their fans. At times, it spilled over. Fabian Delph was fortunate not to go in the book for a foul on Jorginho, and then did shortly before half-time with a late challenge on Mount. Seamus Coleman and Yerry Mina, back in the side, unsettled Azpilicueta, who was also booked after taking issue with Everton's Colombian defender. Tuchel was furious with some of the treatment handed out to his players on his first visit to Goodison Park. Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Thomas Tuchel admits Chelsea's form is 'concerning'The football on show was limited in the first half, but it did not deter from a raucous occasion. Mount curled an effort over after eight minutes. Loftus-Cheek, who replaced N'Golo Kante in midfield, made some dangerous runs from deep, and Gordon was a lively presence, shooting wide of the near post with a left-footed effort. But no sooner had fans taken their seats for the second half, Everton went ahead and it was a goal made as a result of their tactics. Azpilicueta dawdled on the edge of the penalty box, allowing Richarlison to pinch the ball from him, receive it back from Gray and slot in at the Gwladys Street End to send the stadium into ecstasy. Three minutes later, Mykolenko hit the side netting from close range. But around the hour mark, the home fans were rewarded with more good defensive play from their team, which was cheered as strongly as if Everton had scored. Mount's initial effort somehow stayed out after he hit both posts, before Pickford produced the first of two miraculous saves, firstly to deny Azpilicueta who had the goal at his mercy. From the resulting corner, Pickford blocked Rudiger's point-blank effort to keep his goal intact. Following that commotion, and with Chelsea desperately searching for an equaliser, the game opened up, leading to further chances for Gray and Richarlison. Pickford was called into further action to deny Loftus-Cheek and Mateo Kovacic. But after seven minutes of stoppage time, the relief and delight inside Goodison was almost tangible as Lampard and his players celebrated a famous win.

Reaction to Spurs' win over Leicester & live commentary of West Ham v ArsenalAttacking trio help Spurs rediscover their grooveWith upcoming matches against title-chasing Liverpool and top-four rivals Arsenal, Tottenham knew the importance of returning to winning ways against a Leicester side with more pressing priorities this week.Spurs had not won either their two previous matches, punished for a sluggish display in a home defeat by Brighton and unable to break down a stubborn Brentford last weekend.What was most startling about those performances, considering the amount of attacking talent at their disposal, was Spurs' inability to record a shot on target in either game.But Conte's side led at half-time at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium with their only effort on target, then rediscovered their attacking verve after the break.Their trusted combination up front delivered for the first when Son clipped a corner towards the near post, where Kane had escaped his marker Daniel Amartey to power in.""We scored early in the first half and that changed the game - we knew we'd have more space in the second half,"" said Son.Harry Kane has scored 19 goals in 18 games against Leicester in all competitions - more than against any other sideThe start of the second half was also tight before Son - helped by the running and guile of Kulusevski, introduced as a substitute after surprisingly being left on the bench - ensured there was no way back for Leicester.Tottenham's reinvigoration in front of goal particularly pleased Conte, who took over from former Wolves boss Nuno with Spurs eighth in the table.""I think we were more clinical in this game.

Forward Ayoze Perez forced Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris into a smart stop shortly before Patson Daka thumped the post, then a dangerous cross from Marc Albrighton needed a swift intervention from Cristian Romero with Perez waiting.But it was the old failing of defending corners which came back to damage Leicester.""Defending corners has been a problem for us all season - we lack aggression and cuteness. It was so disappointing,"" said Rodgers.""It is something we will have to look at in the summer through personnel. The mentality to head the ball is missing; it's something we would need to address.""Rodgers was also left cursing Caglar Soyuncu's inability to win a loose ball against Romero, which allowed Kulusevski to set up Son for Spurs' pivotal second.""We got the game back again and started the second half with confidence. We missed a challenge we cannot miss and they end up getting the goal from that. The challenge is in our favour, we have to win it,"" said the Leicester manager.""The players kept fighting and the spirit was there. We kept fighting until the end.

Big teams have to find a way to win ugly when they don't play well.""Speaking on Sky Sports, he added: ""We found a way through set pieces and defending strongly. To win here at West Ham is credit to boys and shows the spirit we have.""Jarrod Bowen did pull the Hammers level just before the break, controlling Vladimir Coufal's cross and squeezing a strike into the bottom corner in what was a reward for a strong first-half performance.But David Moyes' outfit failed to reach those levels after going behind for a second time - and defeat leaves them seventh, three points behind sixth-placed Manchester United with three games remaining. ""I thought we had done well enough,"" Moyes said.""We conceded a couple of set pieces which we are normally very good at, both attacking and defending. We also made a few changes which left out some of the bigger players who might have been involved in those situations.

But, after the hosts failed to properly clear a corner, Gabriel was left unmarked at the back post to head in Gabriel Martinelli's 54th-minute cross, beating former Arsenal stopper Lukasz Fabianski at his near post.Nketiah could have sealed the success on the break, only to curl wide, but the 22-year-old continued to prove a threat after again being trusted to lead the line for Arsenal. The visitors were not at their fluent best, but as the battle with north London rivals Spurs hots up - and with the Gunners heading to Tottenham a week on Thursday - restoring their two-point advantage was the most important outcome for Arsenal.Hammers' season in danger of fizzling outWest Ham 1-2 Arsenal: Hammers 'deserved' point against Gunners - David MoyesInjuries and suspensions have hit the Hammers and they found themselves without three senior centre-backs in Craig Dawson, Issa Diop and Angelo Ogbonna on Sunday, with left-back Aaron Cresswell chosen to partner Kurt Zouma.That may have been partly to blame for the hosts coming unstuck twice from set-pieces, but this was also West Ham's 52nd match of the season - 11 more than Arsenal have played - and they struggled to unpick the Gunners as the game wore on. The hosts found themselves behind despite having the better of the opening half an hour. They responded to Holding's opener within seven minutes when Bowen grabbed his 10th top-flight goal of the campaign, becoming the first Englishman to reach double figures for the club since Kevin Nolan in 2012-13.Moyes turned to Michail Antonio, rested before Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg, with 19 minutes remaining to try to find a leveller for the second time, but the forward only managed one touch in the opposition box.The Hammers have now dropped points in each of their past four Premier League matches following a Europa League fixture, while this loss brought their six-game unbeaten home run in the league to an end.More worryingly for Moyes, his side are winless in their past four Premier League outings - and the Scot will not want what has been a productive season to fizzle out now.

206,Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool: Naby Keita scores as Reds keep up the pressure on Man City,SAT 30 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Naby Keita scored his fourth goal of the season for LiverpoolLiverpool kept themselves firmly in the fight for the quadruple as they overcame a spirited Newcastle to keep up the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester City.Jurgen Klopp made five changes at St James' Park, including leaving top scorer Mohamed Salah on the bench, after the Champions League semi-final on Wednesday.It looked like it would backfire as in-form Newcastle started strongly, pressing Liverpool high and forcing them into a couple of early mistakes.But Liverpool grew into the game and were dominating possession when Naby Keita struck in the 19th minute.The midfielder showed great composure as he dribbled across the box and past Martin Dubravka before slotting into the net.Liverpool and Man City fixtures for title run-inSadio Mane should have made it 2-0 before the break when his shot on the counter was too close to Dubravka, who also made a fine save from a Diogo Jota header.The Newcastle fans, who were aggrieved that play continued in the lead-up to Liverpool's goal because Fabian Schar was down injured, thought Miguel Almiron had equalised after rounding Alisson, only for the effort was ruled out for offside.The hosts also made a lively start to the second half, although Liverpool went closest to adding a second with Mane shooting wide from close range before Jota's shot was pushed over.It was not a vintage Liverpool display, but they got the job done and they are second, one point behind Manchester City, who won at Leeds later on Saturday to reclaim top spot after a brief spell in first place for the Reds.Reaction to all of Saturday's Premier League gamesHow Milner underlines Liverpool strength in depthVisit our Newcastle United pageGo straight to all the best Liverpool contentNewcastle 0-1 Liverpool: Klopp praises Liverpool in 'top class game'Liverpool show their strengthThe Liverpool line-up may have intrigued City boss Pep Guardiola, who, while focused on his own side's pursuit of a treble, will no doubt welcome any helping hand in denting his rivals' title bid.Thiago - excellent in the 2-0 Champions League semi-final win against Villarreal in midweek - was on the bench alongside Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold.It could have been seen as a big risk, but instead it emphasised the incredible strength in depth in this Liverpool squad. James Milner came in and was his dependable self, providing experience in midfield, while Joe Gomez was solid at right-back and the front three of Luis Diaz, Jota and Mane caused as many problems as any of the attacking combinations Liverpool could field.When Newcastle pressed for an equaliser in the closing stages, Liverpool were able to send on Thiago, Salah and Fabinho to see the game out.Against a side who had won their previous six home games, Liverpool fans had a right to feel apprehensive, but the Reds overcame a big hurdle that serves only to strengthen the feeling that they will end this season with multiple trophies.Newcastle show gritOnly Liverpool and City boast a better record in 2022 than Newcastle and there was understandably a buoyant mood among the home fans before kick-off. The match provided Newcastle with an opportunity to show what sort of threat they pose to teams at the top end of the table - and they certainly gave a good account of themselves.They started superbly, getting at Liverpool from the outset and making their opponents nervous.Although Newcastle could not maintain their high-tempo start, there was still a sense of pride at St James' Park at the fight shown against one of the best sides in Europe.Newcastle 0-1 Liverpool: Newcastle 'missed that moment of quality' - Eddie Howe",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198622

The full-back was also outmuscled by Watkins, whose finish was aided by a slight deflection.At full-time the Norwich fans applauded their side's effort and there was no outpouring of emotion.The club's joint majority shareholder Delia Smith watched from the stands and some may again question the hierarchy's resistance to spending big following promotion.But their prudency, and manager Smith's previous promotion with Villa, should leave Norwich well placed to bounce back once again.""We will try everything to come up again,"" said Smith.

However, the Frenchman's challenge was deemed to be outside the box and McNeil struck the subsequent free-kick straight into the Hornets wall.Emmanuel Dennis forced Nick Pope into a smart save at his near post following yet another Tarkowski deflection, as Watford continued to threaten.Burnley improved after the interval, though, and a lapse in concentration early in the second half from Ismaila Sarr almost gifted Lennon an equaliser, but Foster produced a fine save low to his left to snuff out the danger.The home side had opportunities to add to their lead on the counter-attack, but a combination of poor passing and wasteful finishing set up a nervous finish as Burnley slowly turned the screw.Foster managed to tip Barnes' powerful header on to the crossbar, but the warning went unheeded as Cork's header restored parity with seven minutes remaining.Brownhill completed the turnaround three minutes later, guiding a right-footed strike into the bottom corner after Watford had failed to properly clear McNeil's free-kick.This is the first time Burnley have won three Premier League games in a row since 2019, while Jackson also becomes the first manager to stay unbeaten in his first four top-flight matches in charge of the Clarets.The last manager not to lose any of their first four league games with the club was Owen Coyle in 2007.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198625

We're in eighth position and we try to do better. To improve we need to have a plan and we need to convince the right players with the right personality to increase the level of the team.""We didn't come to play. We came to watch Brighton play. It was the worst performance since the first day.""Graham Potter's Brighton showed pockets of their vibrant style throughout to create a flow of chances and they have now compiled a gritty run of form, losing just once in six outings - against Manchester City - and picking up 11 points in the process.They have now reached 44 points - their highest mark since reaching the Premier League in 2017 - and sit ninth, a place below Wolves who have now lost three in a row without scoring.Visit our Wolves pageGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion contentBrighton back to very bestPotter praises 'very impressive' BrightonThere can be no greater example of Brighton's adventurous approach than the fact Marc Cucurella - the left centre-back in a back three - was powering forward to cross into the box in the build-up to Bissouma's late finish. Their freedom and ambition proved too much for Wolves, whose fans poured out of the ground in the closing stages.This was Brighton's biggest league win of the season and they started with intent, with Enock Mwepu twice forcing Wolves keeper Jose Sa into action before the penalty award.Referee Simon Hooper checked a Roman Saiss' handball in the box on the touchline monitor, only for Mac Allister to miss Brighton's third penalty in a row in 2022.But Willy Boly's trip on the ever-willing Danny Welbeck gave the Seagulls a second penalty and Mac Allister wrestled the ball off Trossard before whipping home from the spot.Cucurella was superb - seeing more of the ball than any player and completing 87% of his passes - while Welbeck created three chances for others in a selfless display and 20-year-old Moises Caicedo offered a blend of bite and composure in midfield.Trossard patiently crafted space to finish after being found by Welbeck for the second, while Bissouma - back from suspension - drove the third from range as Brighton continued to show ambition despite their lead.Potter's side had lost six in a row from February into March but this win further demonstrates that they have now rediscovered their very best form.Blunt Wolves need striker optionsIt was the worst performance since my first day - LageWolves' only significant threat saw substitute Pedro Neto strike the post in the final attack of the day but their fans were rightly frustrated with this latest setback in their bid to finish seventh and possibly qualify for Europe.The loss of Nelson Semedo to injury on the day was an added frustration, though the return to action of midfielder Ruben Neves after six weeks out with injury was at least a positive.Lage will surely look to add firepower next term as Raul Jimenez - who came on for the peripheral Fabio Silva at half-time - remains their top scorer on six goals this season. No side has a lower-scoring top scorer in the league.It is in some ways remarkable Wolves can be sat eighth having scored just 33 goals this term. Only Burnley, Watford and Norwich have fewer. The blunt nature of their attack showed here on a day they must quickly put behind them if they are to finish the season positively.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198623

The reigning Premier League champions went ahead in the 13th minute when Rodri glanced home Phil Foden's free-kick and while Leeds were spirited, they barely tested visiting keeper Ederson until the game was lost. City doubled their advantage nine minutes after the break from another set-piece, Nathan Ake pouncing from close range when Foden's corner was headed down by Ruben Dias. Foden was City's brilliant orchestrator and he was involved again when he set up the third for Gabriel Jesus with 12 minutes left, before Fernadinho added the fourth with virtually the last kick of the game.The win means City are a point ahead of Liverpool, with four games left for both teams.Liverpool and Man City fixtures for title run-inRelive Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Leeds United contentVisit our Manchester City pageMan City survive cauldron in styleCity boss Guardiola praises 'fantastic' players in 'really good game'It is now a case of who blinks first in the title race. Liverpool put the pressure on Manchester City by going to in-form Newcastle United and winning in the lunchtime game. For the late game, manager Pep Guardiola had to consider not only the challenges posed by the traditional fearsome atmosphere inside Elland Road and a Leeds United side desperate for the points, but also this coming Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid.Guardiola left Kevin de Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez on the bench to keep them fresh for the test of protecting a 4-3 lead in Spain.The strategy worked as City came through in relative comfort in what was always going to be a tough physical examination. City were helped by Leeds' struggles to defend those set-pieces, with Rodri glancing home the first goal with ease early on and Ake being allowed too much time to turn in the second. The pressure will be on every game for City now, with Liverpool also showing no signs of slipping up, but this was imperious from Guardiola's men, who were simply too good for a Leeds side who showed lots of commitment but lacked quality and threat. Foden was behind all of City's best work, a spectacular talent, a creator who adds a tireless work-rate and strength to his many other qualities. With their Premier League lead restored, City's pursuit of glory now moves on to the Bernabeu.Leeds still in troubleLeeds manager Marsch pleased with Leeds display despite defeatPremier League relegation run-in: Everton, Leeds, Burnley - fixtures & who will go down?Leeds have experienced something of a bounce since the sacking of the beloved Marcelo Bielsa in February, and his replacement with Marsch, but they are still in real danger of the drop. Burnley's remarkable renaissance since sacking Sean Dyche and replacing him with Mike Jackson has set nerves jangling at Elland Road - and even louder at Everton. Leeds showed their spirit was intact and the magnificent, noisy support of their followers can never be doubted as they continued to give deafening backing to their side even with the game gone. Marsch, however, needs to somehow find goals in the latest absence of main striker Patrick Bamford and the loss of the influential Stuart Dallas to what looked like a serious injury when he flew into a challenge on Jack Grealish. Dallas, under-rated outside Leeds, is the glue which helps to hold the side together and he will be a major loss. Leeds cannot allow this comprehensive defeat by a side of City's class to inflict too much damage on morale. There is no time for that and there is no shame in being beaten by such quality. They must refocus for two tough upcoming games, away to Arsenal and at home to Chelsea. Everton may have two games in hand, but have a tough run-in of their own - and Leeds have what might be five crucial extra points on the board.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61198621

But the game ended all square as Chelsea edged closer to securing a top-four finish.

His value to the team has often been questioned since his return to Old Trafford but, at the age of 37, he continues to defy the odds as he moved joint-second on the Premier League top scorers list with 17 goals.A missed opportunity for ChelseaManchester United 1-1 Chelsea; Thomas Tuchel happy with 'very strong' performanceChelsea had won their past eight games on the road in all competitions - and they will wonder how they failed to make it nine as this draw ended that club record run.Taking their chances has been an issue throughout this season and although De Gea was in incredible form the Blues will no doubt feel frustrated they could not score more than once.In the end, it was a missed opportunity for the visitors but one that shouldn't dent their chances of finishing in the top four, with seven points needed from their five remaining games to guarantee that.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61171596

We go into every game wanting three points but if we can't score, we have to shut up shop and we did that.""However, the Leeds and England midfielder was unhappy with Crystal Palace's Zaha and added: ""He is a good player, but we defended against him well as a team. ""The ref complained at us for fouling him but I think he dives a lot to be honest with you.""Vieira defended the Ivory Coast international, saying: ""I was happy Wilf Zaha kept his cool because it looked like they planned to stop him by fouling him.""That won't be the first time teams try to frustrate him.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61137148

The Blues had lost their previous three games at Stamford Bridge, conceding 11 goals in the process, and were indebted to Christian Pulisic's 90th-minute winner three minutes after Jorginho's woeful penalty was saved. David Moyes rested six players before West Ham's Europa League semi-final tie against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday and it looked like they might hold on for a precious point when Jorginho's tame effort was saved by Lukasz Fabianski after 87 minutes.But after Craig Dawson was sent off following a video assistant review (VAR) for fouling Romelu Lukaku in the build-up to the spot-kick, Pulisic became the saviour as he tucked in Marcos Alonso's low cross.After a lacklustre performance, the goal sparked relief for Tuchel and the home fans as they recovered from their midweek 4-2 defeat by Arsenal to move five points clear of the fourth-placed Gunners.""It is a deserved clean sheet and disciplined performance,"" Tuchel said. ""We needed a clean sheet and home win to release the pressure and tension. The atmosphere is now good. This is good for confidence.""West Ham will be distraught they did not get anything from the game after a sterling display, with Declan Rice, Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio all starting on the bench.Dawson, who was otherwise excellent with a number of blocks, will also feel aggrieved as West Ham remain seventh, eight points behind Arsenal.Chelsea 1-0 West Ham United: Thomas Tuchel grateful after 'needed' Blues winStuttering Chelsea saved by PulisicChelsea's recent woes on the pitch have mirrored their uncertainty off it as the club waits for new owners to take charge and give it new direction.Recent defensive problems have not been helped by news that Antonio Rudiger is set to leave at the end of the season after failing to agree a new deal despite being offered a contract of more than £200,000 a week. But this late victory gave Stamford Bridge a huge lift even if it looked as if Jorginho had thrown away Chelsea's best chance when his under-hit penalty was easily gathered by the West Ham goalkeeper. A clean sheet for the hosts was also welcome, particularly as they were without the injured Rudiger and Reece James, and forced into a late reshuffle when Andreas Christensen was replaced by Trevoh Chalobah, despite the Dane initially being named in the starting line-up. James was missed in a lacklustre first half. Ruben Loftus-Cheek filled in at right wing-back but Chelsea could not penetrate West Ham's defensive wall under the expert marshalling of the evergreen Mark Noble.In front of another restricted crowd of 32,231 because of sanctions against owner Roman Abramovich, and with striker Lukaku starting the game back on the bench, there was little to rouse the crowd before the break with only an off-target effort by N'golo Kante coming anywhere close. West Ham were happy to soak up the pressure and went closer to scoring through Andriy Yarmolenko and Said Benrahma, although the latter's saved effort was deemed offside. The first shot on target did not come until close to the hour mark, when the home fans finally got off their seats. Dawson brilliantly blocked Timo Werner's effort before Kante and Chalobah had shots saved by Fabianski. Tuchel also woke from a slumber to berate the officials after Rice was deemed to have been fouled shortly after coming on to replace Noble. After Werner went close twice more, Tuchel made a triple substitution with Lukaku, Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech all coming on. And it was not long before it made an impact. Lukaku was slipped through and pulled back by Dawson. Referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty and a yellow card, but after a VAR review upgraded it to a red. That looked like it would lead to a home win when Jorginho, who had converted his last 13 spot-kicks, stepped up. But his embarrassment was spared by Pulisic, who scored his seventh goal of the season from Alonso's cut-back, leading to Tuchel and the fans punching the air in delight.

The deadlock was broken after 62 minutes when Andy Robertson arrived at the far post in front of the Kop to head home Mo Salah's cross. Everton could not respond, although Demarai Gray powered a drive just wide, and Liverpool wrapped up the win when substitute Divock Origi tormented the neighbours once again when he headed in Luis Diaz's bicycle kick with six minutes left. The loss means the Toffees end the day in the top-flight's bottom three for the first time since 6 December 2019. They were last in the relegation zone this far into the season in 1998-99.Best action and reaction from Liverpool v Everton in the Premier LeagueLiverpool's run of results 'insane', says Klopp'Relegation threat a grim reality for Everton'Liverpool get the job doneLiverpool 2-0 Everton: Klopp praises Reds improvement after slow startThis was not the flowing, blistering Liverpool that effectively won the FA Cup semi-final in the first 45 minutes against Manchester City at Wembley and who dismantled a hapless Manchester United at Anfield.Everton's rearguard action and determination to disrupt Liverpool infuriated and frustrated Anfield in the first 45 minutes but eventually the dam broke and for all the visitors' courage they were not able to hold out.Manager Klopp may well take as much pleasure from how Liverpool were forced to dig deep and overcome Everton's determined challenge as he would from the way they have swept so many teams aside this season. Liverpool had to fight for control and, in truth, they were never in their normal level of command and still had to survive one or two anxious moments before the final whistle. It puts the Reds right back in City's rearview mirror after Pep Guardiola's side thrashed Watford 5-1, and still on course for their ambition of adding the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup to the EFL Cup.Liverpool now face Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final first leg at Anfield on Wednesday as firm favourites and their challenge continues to gather huge momentum. Everton must take heart despite defeatLiverpool 2-0 Everton: ""You don't get them at Anfield"" - Lampard bemoans penalty decisionsEverton find themselves in a very hazardous position in the relegation places after this loss at Liverpool followed Burnley's win against Wolverhampton Wanderers.Frank Lampard's side are now in serious danger of relegation and their 17% possession displays how on the back foot they were, but there were other elements of this game that must encourage them as they try to avoid the drop into the Championship.They will certainly believe they should have had a penalty when the outstanding Anthony Gordon tumbled under a challenge from Joel Matip with the score 0-0 after 53 minutes.It looked like a clear penalty but was waved away by Stuart Attwell, who had earlier booked the talented youngster for diving.Gordon also shot across the face of goal with a good chance before Liverpool took the lead and Gray fired a rising drive inches off target as his side looked to equalise.Robertson also made a vital goalline clearance with Alex Iwobi poised to turn home Dele Alli's cross.Everton were fiercely well-drilled until Liverpool went ahead. It was not pretty but Everton do not have to make excuses for that. They could hardly be expected to play an open, expansive game and make themselves lambs to the slaughter.What is beyond doubt, though, is that Everton are now in serious peril, especially with Burnley seemingly completely reinvigorated after Sean Dyche was sacked and Mike Jackson appointed as caretaker. Jackson has hauled in seven points in three games in charge and the momentum is now with Burnley. This is something Lampard and Everton must address, quickly.

218,Arsenal 3-1 Manchester United: Granit Xhaka seals win as Gunners stay fourth in Champions League race,SAT 23 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Bukayo Saka is Arsenal's top scorer this season with 12 goals in all competitionsArsenal stepped up their claims for a place in the Premier League's top four at the expense of Manchester United's ambitions in a thriller at Emirates Stadium. The Gunners came into the game on an upswing after ending a run of three successive defeats with victory at Chelsea, while United were attempting to bounce back from a humiliating 4-0 loss at Liverpool. And Arsenal took three crucial points as the visitors paid the price for shambolic defending and a missed penalty by Bruno Fernandes that undermined an enterprising attacking display. Nuno Tavares put Arsenal in front after only three minutes following errors from Raphael Varane and Alex Telles, the defender turning in a simple finish after David de Gea saved Bukayo Saka's shot.Eddie Nketiah then had an effort ruled out by the video assistant referee for offside but after being called to look at his pitchside monitor the referee awarded a penalty for a foul by Telles on Saka immediately before Nketiah's shot, and Saka converted from the spot.United were a real danger in attack, the returning Cristiano Ronaldo deservedly pulling a goal back before the break for his 100th Premier League goal.It set the scene for a United siege, only for Fernandes to waste their big chance by carelessly rolling a second-half spot-kick against the post after Tavares handled. Arsenal cashed in on the reprieve when Granit Xhaka sealed the win by lashing home the Gunners' third from 25 yards with 20 minutes remaining.United's Champions League hopes are 'gone', says RangnickReaction to Arsenal's win and live coverage of the rest of Saturday's Premier League actionWinning week for ArsenalArteta praises 'magnificent' ArsenalArsenal's win completed a superb response to three league losses that had jeopardised their top-four hopes. Mikel Arteta's side had to fight through adversity - they were not convincing defensively and had several escapes - but they seized their chances when they came to take full advantage of United's carelessness in front of goal. Tavares gave them the perfect start and while goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale had a mixed afternoon, he also made some crucial saves, one from Telles early on and another from Diogo Dalot proving significant. But Xhaka's thumping drive gave De Gea no chance and there was a real mood of celebration inside Emirates Stadium at the final whistle. Arsenal have inflicted serious damage on any slim hopes United may have had of reaching the top four, while Tottenham's 0-0 draw at Brentford later on Saturday means the Gunners are two points clear of their north London rivals in fourth.United misery continuesCristiano Ronaldo missed Manchester United's defeat at Liverpool in midweek following the death of his baby boyWhile Manchester United's performance bore no resemblance to the embarrassing capitulation at Liverpool, the end result was still the same and their hopes of taking a place in next season's Champions League are fading fast.They are now six points behind Arsenal, having played a game more and with only four league matches left. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick has become increasingly outspoken about their failings, likening what needs to be done at Old Trafford under new manager Erik ten Hag to ""open heart surgery"".He rang the changes here, dropping Harry Maguire after a traumatic week in which the United captain not only suffered a nightmare display at Liverpool but also had to cope with police conducting a sweep of his home after a bomb threat.It did not have the desired effect as United were let down by defensive frailty despite a performance that contained real menace going forward. United were also left complaining bitterly when they were not awarded a first-half penalty after Cedric Soares appeared to handle. Dalot twice struck the woodwork and Ramsdale was called into action often, so the commitment could not be questioned here. There was much that was good about United's display but the decisive moment was that second-half penalty miss by Fernandes with Arsenal hanging on desperately at 2-1. He went through an elaborate jig before carelessly rolling his spot-kick against the post. In that moment Arsenal were reprieved and United struggling, before Xhaka finished them off.

219,Leicester 0-0 Aston Villa: Scrappy draw ends losing run for Steven Gerrard's side,SAT 23 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Ollie Watkins (right) got sights of goal in a game where half-chances were as good as it got for both sidesAston Villa ended a four-game losing run with a draw at Leicester in which both sides struggled to provide moments of quality in a scrappy end-of-season game.Steven Gerrard's side faced up to Leicester pressure in the opening 45 minutes before improving after the break.The home side enjoyed 67% of the ball in the first half but rarely went close, with a well-timed clearance by Villa defender Ashley Young denying James Justin.Villa struggled for fluency throughout - completing just 68% of their passes to Leicester's 86% - but they will look back on a Tyrone Mings header that flew over the bar on half-time and half-chances for Ollie Watkins as moments that could have given them three points.For Leicester, it was a first Premier League clean sheet since 5 March but perhaps their biggest positive was a return off the bench for striker Jamie Vardy, who has featured just twice in 2022 because of injury.Brendan Rodgers' side had played four times since Villa were last in action and unsurprisingly they shuffled their line-up with Thursday's Europa Conference League semi-final against Roma on the horizon. The draw sees them drop to 10th in the table.'Our heart is big' - Rodgers proud of Leicester display""In the last couple of games, we played really well, but in the final third we couldn't find the killer pass,"" Rodgers told Match of the Day. ""Maybe that is a lack of energy because of the number of games we've played - the speed of our attacking combinations is not quite as we want it. Our heart and effort is there though.""Villa stay 15th but, after a torrid run of form, Gerrard said this first goalless draw of the season offered a ""good base"", while captain Mings acknowledged it was ""important to put the losing streak to bed"".The visitors saw a late whipped effort by substitute Emiliano Buendia curl wide with Kasper Schmeichel concerned enough to scramble across his goal but a draw was the fair outcome.The sides shared 31 fouls - comfortably the most of Saturday's Premier League fixtures, and a marker of the fragmented nature of the game.Leicester attacked through wide areas as Villa's disciplined shape prevented attacks in central areasIn pre-match discussion, the prospect of a fifth consecutive loss for Villa had brought reminders that former manager Dean Smith was dismissed in November having endured a five-game losing run.But Gerrard can draw comfort from how committed his side were and how their disciplined defensive approach forced Leicester into wide areas, their crosses often dealt with by the towering Mings.Leicester saw Youri Tielemans offer glimpses of his class - completing 91% of his passes and winning all eight of his duels - but the home side generally struggled to get their attackers into the game.There was little to thrill those at the King Power but they at least go into the next leg of their European adventure with just one loss in eight games in all competitions.Gerrard 'satisfied' with 'very important' point",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61125047
220,Man City 5-1 Watford: Gabriel Jesus scores four as Premier League leaders move four points clear,SAT 23 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Jesus has now scored 11 goals in all competitions for City this season. His best tally since joining in 2016 is 23, in 2019-20Gabriel Jesus scored four goals and made a fifth as Manchester City thrashed Watford to move four points clear at the top of the Premier League.With a month of the season to go, City know they will be champions if they win all their remaining league games and they will hope for more afternoons like this one, where their victory was never in doubt.Watford tried their best, but they were outclassed by a rampant City team and remain anchored in the bottom three, seven points adrift of safety.The Hornets have suffered heavy defeats at Etihad Stadium before, losing 8-0 here on their last visit in 2019. They suffered more misery this time, with Jesus the man most responsible.The Brazilian put City ahead inside four minutes when he turned in Oleksandr Zinchenko's driven cross, then doubled their lead when he headed home a precise Kevin de Bruyne delivery from close range.Hassane Kamara pulled a goal back when his powerful angled drive eluded Ederson, but Rodri restored City's two-goal advantage before the break with a thunderous shot into the top corner after Jesus found him on the edge of the area.Any hope of a Hornets comeback was ended right at the start of the second half, when Kamara's mistake allowed Jesus to run in at goal and he was felled by visiting keeper Ben Foster.Referee Kevin Friend pointed at the spot and, after a lengthy VAR check not helped by a problem with Friend's microphone, the decision stood - allowing Jesus to slam home the penalty and complete his first Premier League hat-trick since arriving in Manchester in 2016. Jesus was not done yet, rounding off a superb team move soon afterwards when he ran on to a De Bruyne pass, and although no more goals followed in the final half hour, City had long since wrapped up the points.Are Man City facing summer Jesus dilemma?Manchester City 5-1 Watford: Pep Guardiola full of praise for his playersEvery goal counts for City nowCity's advantage over second-placed Liverpool is the biggest it has been since 16 March, but that might only last until Sunday's Merseyside derby, when the Reds have a chance to respond.In a title race as tight as this one, goal difference could well play a part and the size of this win means City's is now on +59, just two behind Liverpool on +61.While City were expected to improve those numbers against the struggling Hornets, to see Jesus lead their charge was something of a surprise.Before Saturday, the 25-year-old Brazilian had scored only seven goals all season, with just three of those in the league, and he was being used more often as a right winger than a striker.His future was uncertain too, with his contract up in 2023 and talk of a possible switch to Arsenal this summer emerging this week, so this was a reminder of his value of Pep Guardiola's side.You would not quite describe Jesus as an unlikely hero - he has played a big part in too many of City's previous successes for that, but this was a timely return to scoring form, especially with Real Madrid the next visitors to the Etihad in the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday.Watford face crunch Burnley matchWatford's gameplan was to frustrate City by defending in numbers and attacking on the break, but the scoreline tells you how successful it turned out.Their counter-attack did work on occasions, with Emmanuel Dennis only denied by a last-ditch Zinchenko challenge when he escaped with the score at 1-0, but stopping City proved impossible despite the Hornets' hard work.When Watford last won, at Southampton on 13 March, only goal difference kept them in the bottom three but four successive defeats have left them well adrift, with the games running out.Next up for Roy Hodgson's side are fellow strugglers Burnley, and defeat then would surely end their hopes of staying up.The Clarets are much more beatable than City, of course, but the problem for Watford is that they face them at Vicarage Road, where they have lost their past 10 games.

This is the first time since May 2014 that Newcastle have been as high as ninth this far into a season - and that is despite them spending 150 days in the relegation zone.Follow live coverage of Saturday's Premier League action hereNewcastle turnaround has been incredible - ShearerNewcastle have incredible desire to win - HoweFive months a long time in footballWhen these sides met in November, a 1-1 draw at St James' Park, Newcastle were bottom of the table with no wins from 14 games. No team had ever stayed up from that position.Norwich were three points and two places above them.But Newcastle's fortunes have turned entirely with the Saudi Arabian takeover, Howe's management and several big January signings.One of Howe's biggest successes has been changing Joelinton from a goal-shy striker to a combative midfielder - although he was back up front in this game as £25m Chris Wood was left on the bench.His first goal came when Norwich defenders failed to clear Saint-Maximin's pass after good wing play by Murphy, a goal which eventually stood after a video assistant referee check for a possible Murphy offside.Guimaraes sent Murphy and Joe Willock through with a lovely through ball - as both got in behind the Norwich defence - with Joelinton scoring from Murphy's ball at the back post.Norwich gave Newcastle a helping hand - SmithNorwich were well beaten by the time Krul's lazy pass to Kenny McLean was cut out by £35m winter recruit Guimaraes, who lofted the ball over the Dutch keeper.Joelinton had one chance for a hat-trick, shooting at Krul from outside the box, before he was replaced by Miguel Almiron in the 67th minute.At one stage Newcastle fans were dreaming of 17th place and safety. Now they are 15 points clear of the relegation zone.Things could have been different had Dowell taken either of his first-half chances for Norwich. First he lobbed over from Mathias Normann's pass and then he sliced over from Teemu Pukki's cut-back.Dean Smith's side's fate is all but sealed now with eight points to catch up in five games - plus a worse goal difference and more games played than most of the teams above them.Even if Pukki had scored a chance when he fired wide of the far post, they never looked like coming back.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61125046
222,Brentford 0-0 Tottenham: Spurs' top-four hopes suffer blow,SAT 23 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Christian Eriksen was greeted warmly by the away section as the former Spurs player continues his return following cardiac arrest at Euro 2020Tottenham's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League suffered a setback as they were held to a goalless draw by Brentford, with Bees midfielder Christian Eriksen impressing against his former club.The Denmark midfielder, facing Spurs for the first time since he left for Inter Milan in January 2020, was given a warm reception by players and fans before kick-off in west London.He was central to much of Brentford's attacking play, particularly from set pieces, and they were inches from a dramatic late winner when his added-time free-kick was headed onto a post by Ivan Toney.Another Eriksen corner in the first half was also headed onto an upright by Toney, while Pontus Jansson's header was cleared off the line by Harry Kane in the second half.Tottenham, in contrast, failed to have a shot on target for the second successive game as their largely lifeless attacking play was repelled by a resilient Bees defence.England captain Kane went closest to snatching the points for the visitors when his acrobatic scissor-kick flew just wide with Bees keeper David Raya at full stretch.Antonio Conte's side are now two points behind Arsenal in fifth after their north London rivals beat Manchester United in Saturday's early kick-off to move the Gunners into the final Champions League qualification position.The draw moves Brentford above Brighton into 11th and onto 40 points, with the Bees now looking all but certain of Premier League survival.Eriksen the star of the showBees boss Frank proud of 'top performance' against SpursMuch of the pre-match focus was understandably on Eriksen as he continues his remarkable return to English football following his cardiac arrest during Euro 2020.The 30-year-old, who made 305 appearances in a six-and-a-half year spell with Tottenham, was seen hugging some of his former team-mates in the tunnel before kick-off and was given a standing ovation by the Spurs fans when he went to take an early corner in front of the away section.He was then given an equally raucous ovation by both sets of fans at full time and signed a Tottenham fans' shirt which had his name on the back.Eriksen feels the love during Spurs reunionThat contributed to a relaxed atmosphere on a sunny spring evening in west London, with Brentford going into the game 11 points clear of the bottom three and closing in on Premier League safety after a run of five wins from six games.That revival owes a lot to the arrival of Eriksen, with no Brentford player creating more chances than the Dane since his debut for the club in February.He had been on the winning side in all five of the games he had previously started for Thomas Frank's side.The winning run ended here, but it is still a valuable point that all but guarantees a second season in the Premier League.With Eriksen's short-term contract expiring at the end of the campaign, securing his long-term future is likely to be high on Frank's to-do list as the Brentford boss begins his planning for next season.Tottenham stutter in front of goalBrentford 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur: Spurs boss Conte left frustrated with goalless drawAfter netting 25 goals in seven Premier League games, Tottenham failed to register a shot on target in a match for the fourth time in the Premier League this season, twice as many as any other side, as they conceded the initiative to Arsenal in the race for the top four.They did not attempt a shot of any note until the 27th minute -  a wild Rodrigo Bentancur effort that went way over the bar.Spurs attempted to raise the tempo after the break but struggled to break down a determined Bees backline, with Jansson, Rico Henry and Mads Bech Sorensen all making decisive blocks.Kane's athletic volley from Dejan Kulusevski's cross nearly gave them a flattering victory and so lacklustre were Spurs that Conte may deem it a point gained than two lost.The Italian's side now face tough matches against Leicester City and Liverpool before what looks likely to be a decisive north London derby at home to Arsenal on 12 May.Recap of Saturday's Premier League gamesVisit our Brentford pageGo straight to all the best Tottenham contentEriksen's best Premier League moments for Tottenham and Brentford",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61125044

They have played a game more than Everton, but are now just a point behind Frank Lampard's side and boast a better goal difference, while Leeds - currently five points above the drop zone - are also not completely safe. If Burnley can now earn at least a point against Wolves at home on Sunday, Everton will head into the Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Anfield later that afternoon sitting inside the bottom three.There were no signs of tension in the Clarets camp as Roberts broke the deadlock after being given time to turn on the edge of the box and pick his spot with his left foot - a goal befitting Burnley's slick attacking performance.The hosts could and should have had more, but found Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster in top form as he denied Wout Weghorst with his feet and twice kept out Jay Rodriguez before Weghorst headed against the post. Eventually Burnley's superiority told as Collins climbed highest in the box to meet Josh Brownhill's corner and nod it into the bottom corner, although celebrations were put on hold at an anxious Turf Moor as VAR watched to see if the ball had clipped the offside Jack Cork on its way in.Southampton, after beating Arsenal last time out, slipped back into their indifferent recent form with the visitors' best chances falling to Oriol Romeu, who headed wide of either post from James Ward-Prowse corners in the first half. They did briefly threaten a response inside the final 20 minutes but Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope saved from Che Adams and Charlie Taylor then made a superb block on the same player, while a scrambled Cork effort at the other end was ruled out for offside.The home fans showed their appreciation for the club's former boss by singing Dyche's name late on, as Burnley headed towards their first top-flight home win without him in the dugout since May 2010, and four points from a possible six since his departure.

224,Chelsea 2-4 Arsenal: Eddie Nketiah scores twice in win for Gunners,WED 20 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Eddie Nketiah had not scored in the Premier League for a year prior to his double at Stamford BridgeArsenal got their pursuit of a place in the Premier League's top four back on track as they ended a run of three defeats with a crucial victory at Chelsea. The Gunners' hopes of securing a place in next season's Champions League had been significantly damaged by those losses but this win will provide renewed belief. Eddie Nketiah was selected ahead of out-of-sorts Alexandre Lacazette in Arsenal's attack and he rewarded manager Mikel Arteta's faith when he took advantage of Andreas Christensen's weak back pass with a composed finish. It was the start of a chaotic first half as Timo Werner equalised with a deflected shot four minutes later before Emile Smith Rowe showed a touch of class to beat Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy with a cool finish from the edge of the area. Chelsea were back on terms again before the break through captain Cesar Azpilicueta but Nketiah pounced on a series of defensive errors in the Blues' box to put Arsenal back in front just before the hour mark. Bukayo Saka was outstanding for Arsenal and he got the reward his performance deserved when he sealed the win from the spot in added time after he was hauled down by Azpilicueta. The Gunners are now level on points with north London rivals Tottenham with a derby at Emirates Stadium still to come.Arsenal produce at crucial momentChelsea 2-4 Arsenal: A 'great night' for the Gunners - Mikel ArtetaQuestions about Arsenal's character and ability to maintain a fight for a top-four finish were starting to be asked after three defeats in a row but this was a display that showed plenty of grit. Arsenal were on the front foot right from the start, pressing Chelsea into mistakes and refusing to buckle even when Thomas Tuchel's side equalised twice. Nketiah was the headline-grabber with two goals but Saka and Smith Rowe showed Arsenal have two real gems for the future. Saka gave Marcos Alonso a tough time on Arsenal's right flank, helping to create Smith Rowe's goal, setting up other chances then scoring the fourth with a clinical penalty after he was fouled. Smith Rowe demonstrated great composure to finish sweetly for his 11th goal of the season, a fine tally for this richly promising 21-year-old playmaker. Arsenal now face struggling Manchester United at Emirates Stadium on Saturday lunchtime feeling much better about themselves after a deserved triumph. Chelsea 2-4 Arsenal: Third successive home defeat 'unacceptable' - TuchelChelsea slip up againChelsea were playing in front of a reduced Stamford Bridge crowd of 32,249 with general tickets not on sale because of restrictions imposed on owner Roman Abramovich as a result of his alleged links with Russian president Vladimir Putin. The season ticket holders who were there saw Chelsea suffer their third successive home defeat.That spell has seen them concede 11 goals, four against Brentford and in this game against Arsenal in the league either side of a 3-1 Champions League quarter-final loss to Real Madrid. Chelsea looked nervous and ragged at the back, with Denmark centre-back Christensen the biggest culprit.His weak backpass set Nketiah clear to put Arsenal on their way and it was no surprise when he was replaced by Thiago Silva at the start of the second half. It was also another disappointing night for striker Romelu Lukaku, who was finally given a start and a chance to kick-start his indifferent season by Tuchel. Instead, he struggled and was replaced by Kai Havertz with the feeling that time is running out for the Belgium forward to justify his £97.5m fee.Reaction to Chelsea v Arsenal and Wednesday's other Premier League gamesGo straight to all the best Chelsea contentVisit our Arsenal page",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60269088
225,Everton 1-1 Leicester City: Richarlison scores late to earn hosts precious point,WED 20 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Richarlison has now scored eight goals this season, with seven in the Premier LeagueEverton manager Frank Lampard says he hopes Dele Alli's role in the late draw with Leicester can be ""a big starting point for him"" after his January move from Tottenham. The midfielder has yet to start a game under Lampard, but came off the bench after 58 minutes to help turn the game Everton's way and the 26-year-old played a part in Richarlison's stoppage-time equaliser. The draw lifted Everton four points clear of 18th-placed Burnley, who host Southampton on Thursday. Everton had suffered a nightmare start to the game when Harvey Barnes turned in James Maddison's cross early on.But after substitutes Alli and Salomon Rondon helped the hosts get a foothold in the game, the pair had a hand in Richarlison's eighth goal of the season, which earned a crucial point for Everton before matches against Liverpool and Chelsea. Lampard said Alli had deserved his chance in the side after being ""absolutely spot on"" in training over the last two weeks. ""It's not easy to demand from players that are not playing so much to come in and show your manager you deserve a chance but he's done that,"" Lampard added.""I was really pleased with [the part he played in the goal] and hopefully that can be a big starting point for him.""I don't think the story was ever going to be simple with Dele. We all know the situation when it comes to how the last two or three seasons have looked and that high, high level of player that he reached for a big period of time at Tottenham. ""So I don't think it was a case of things being simple and sometimes you have to work and fight through things and we're in that process with him."" The draw denied Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers a first win at Goodison Park, and it wasted a good start for the visitors, who also squandered several good chances towards the end via Maddison.  The Foxes have already reached a Europa Conference League semi-final this season, but they now sit 11 points behind seventh-placed West Ham, who have played two more games. Lampard 'happy' with spirit shown by EvertonA draw that felt like a winEverton could not turn successive home victories into a third, but after a poor first half, this will feel as good as a win. Without Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who suffered a training-ground injury that could keep him out for two weeks, their front three of Richarlison, Demarai Gray and Anthony Gordon struggled to link together. Gordon's passing and set-piece delivery was particularly woeful, but once Rondon came on to provide a focal point to the attack, and Alli offered some assistance to the impressive Alex Iwobi, the game began to take a different path.   The early goal and dominance by Leicester led to a subdued atmosphere in the first half where despite Richarlison's miscued shot, the home fans were not lifted off their seats until just before the break when Gray fired inches wide from a clever corner.  Leicester had already gone close when Seamus Coleman tackled Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall before the Foxes took the lead. Leicester 'close to being back to our level' - RodgersWith Rodgers making seven changes to the side that lost at Newcastle on Sunday, the visitors were able to cut through the Everton defence easily. Dewsbury-Hall and Maddison both caused problems for the Everton defence, who had Yerry Mina back for the first time since February following a hamstring injury. By contrast, Fabian Delph and Allan were ponderous in midfield with only Iwobi providing the thrust that Everton and their fans craved. But that soon changed in the second half as Alli came on to replace Allan. Unfortunately for the hosts, Gordon's passing was still off, and Richarlison, who had scored only three goals since the turn of the year, wasted another chance after good work by Rondon and a free header from a corner. As Everton pressed for an equaliser, gaps opened up for Leicester to exploit and Maddison went close three times. That ultimately proved costly as Richarlison and his team's persistence earned a crucial point to keep Lampard's side on the right side of the drop zone, regardless of Thursday's results.

""You can forget how hard it's been to get us into this position now. We have to look back with great satisfaction.""You can very quickly forget where we were and where we've come from this season.

Only Norwich (10) and Watford (nine) have drawn blanks in more away fixtures in the competition this term.Vieira, whose side were beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, cut a frustrated figure at full-time, but his opposite number Howe could not hide his delight after guiding the Magpies to their ninth win in 13 league games.Palace didn't compete in Newcastle defeat - Vieira",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60724990
227,Man City 3-0 Brighton: City go back top with six games to play,WED 20 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Manchester City leapfrogged Liverpool back to the Premier League summit thanks to three second-half goals against Brighton.After struggling to break down Graham Potter's men in a frustrating opening period, Kevin de Bruyne provided the inspiration as City restored their one-point advantage.De Bruyne created the opener for Riyad Mahrez and provided the faint final pass for Bernardo Silva to wrap up the scoring eight minutes from time.In between, Phil Foden needed the aid of a deflection to beat the Brighton goalkeeper after Mahrez spotted the England man on his own just outside the box at a corner.The goals relieved building tension around Etihad Stadium and leave City knowing six more wins are now required for Pep Guardiola's men to retain their title, starting with the home game against relegation-threatened Watford on Saturday.Live text commentary of Wednesday's Premier League games, including Man City v BrightonDe Bruyne the differenceManchester City 3-0 Brighton: Pep Guardiola praises 'exceptional' City performanceDe Bruyne did not get his name on the scoresheet but the standing ovation he received as he was replaced by Gabriel Jesus shortly after Bernardo's goal said everything about the Belgian's contribution.With frustration mounting in the stands, De Bruyne took direct action eight minutes after the restart.He set off on a surging run from inside his own half and the determination to make an impact meant he kept going when twice he could easily have stopped to claim free-kicks. Instead, he kept his feet and shrugged off a third challenge before running the ball on to Mahrez. The Algerian profited from a couple of fortunate deflections, first to give him the shooting opportunity before a second took it past Robert Sanchez.This was the Algerian's 250th Premier League appearance and he helped boss Guardiola to his 250th win as City's boss - achieved 52 games quicker than any other manager in English top-flight history.After Foden doubled the hosts' lead, De Bruyne was the key man again as Bernardo added a third, deftly flicking on Oleksandr Zinchenko's pass after the Ukrainian - earlier given a warm reception on only his second home appearance since the Russian invasion of his homeland - had taken advantage of Brighton hesitancy inside their own half.After his injury scare during the Champions League quarter-final second leg with Atletico Madrid, Guardiola will want to keep De Bruyne as safe as possible for the remainder of the campaign.The same, presumably, is also true of central defender Ruben Dias, who was introduced at half-time after a seven-week absence with a hamstring injury and seemed to shrug off fears from the bench he had suffered a recurrence.Dogged Brighton's plan finally undoneManchester City 3-0 Brighton: 'The better team won' says Seagulls boss Graham PotterBrighton's awful record against City, eight defeats out of nine Premier League meetings and no away wins in their entire history, offered hardly any cause for optimism.However, buoyed by fabulous recent wins against Tottenham and Arsenal, Potter showed what a side could do with a gameplan that players willingly adhere to.A three-man defence which Lewis Dunk led with his customary authority, was bolstered by a further three in front of them, with limited space in between for City's talented playmakers to exhibit their skills.True, visiting attacking opportunities were rare - the nearest they came in the first half was down to pressure exerted by a Pascal Gross corner that dropped into a dangerous position inside the six-yard box where it was booted clear by Aymeric Laporte.But their efforts were another notable achievement by Potter, who has guided Brighton so close to their highest ever finish.Sadly for the visitors, they were only able to repel City for eight minutes of the second period and after that, it was a familiar story.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60717451
228,"Liverpool 4-0 Manchester United: Luis Diaz, Mohamed Salah & Sadio Mane score at Anfield",TUE 19 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Liverpool are the first team to score eight goals against Manchester United in a Premier League seasonLiverpool outclassed a desperate Manchester United in an embarrassingly one-sided affair at Anfield to go top of the Premier League. Manchester City can regain their place at the summit against Brighton on Wednesday but this was another thrilling reminder of how Jurgen Klopp's team are determined to chase them down in the hunt for a historic quadruple. It was also a graphic illustration of the giant task facing United's manager-elect Erik ten Hag as United were run ragged by the Liverpool powerhouse, the gulf in quality and attitude between the sides a chasm. United were without Cristiano Ronaldo following the death of his newborn son and both sets of supporters paid a moving tribute with applause in the seventh minute. Liverpool were already in front by then, Luis Diaz sweeping home Salah's pass before the Egyptian ended his eight-game goalless sequence from Sadio Mane's brilliant pass after 22 minutes. Mane ended any slim hopes United had of making this a challenging evening for Liverpool with a first-time finish from Diaz's pass in the 69th minute before Salah completed the rout with five minutes left. After their 5-0 win at Old Trafford in October, Liverpool are the first club to score at least eight Premier League goals against United in a single season.The victory moves Jurgen Klopp's side two points clear of defending champions City, who have seven matches left to play before facing Brighton at Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. It also confirmed they will play Champions League football next season.United, who could have moved level on points with fourth-placed Tottenham, remain sixth. On Saturday, the Red Devils go to fifth-placed Arsenal.'Good luck Erik - Man Utd have become a monstrosity'Liverpool loss 'humiliating' - Man Utd boss RangnickFollow all the reaction to Liverpool's comfortable win against Manchester United Liverpool a class apartLiverpool 4-0 Manchester United: 'A really good night' for Reds - Jurgen KloppLiverpool are on an ominous roll and, as against Manchester City in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final, the game was effectively won by half-time following a blistering first 45 minutes. United were on the rack from the first whistle and were swept away by wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, all conducted from midfield by the master orchestrator Thiago Alcantara. Urged on by an exultant Kop, Liverpool simply overwhelmed United as they were quicker, slicker and simply in a different class to their fallen rivals. Thiago's midfield masterclass earned him a standing ovation when he was replaced by Naby Keita but the performances of Diaz, Mane and Salah were of a similar standard. Liverpool have thrown down the gauntlet to reigning champions City before their next game and it is hard to see who will find a way to beat them in this type of form. They have won the Carabao Cup, will face Chelsea in the FA Cup final, are breathing down City's neck in the league and are favourites to progress against Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final. And the way Liverpool are approaching the decisive stage of the season in such prime condition, nothing looks beyond them.All the best Liverpool analysis and reaction, in one placeMohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz all scored and assisted for Liverpool. It is the second time this season a team has had three players both score and assist a goal in a Premier League match, with the other occasion also being Liverpool against Manchester UnitedUnited left humiliated by old enemyThere can be no consolation for United in this abject performance, apart from maybe the fact that Liverpool finished a goal short of inflicting their second 5-0 defeat of the season on the old enemy. It was still Liverpool's biggest ""aggregate"" victory over two games in a league season against United, a statistic that does not exaggerate just how far they are adrift.Liverpool thrashing 'embarrassing' & 'humiliating' - Rangnick Make no mistake, it could have been five and more, Liverpool going off the boil for the early part of the second half before returning to the rampant form of the first half to finish United off. Interim manager Ralf Rangnick has been brutal about his side's failings and they will soon be Ten Hag's problem - and this was so bad it is hard to know where to start. United were without Ronaldo and were so reduced that defender Phil Jones was drafted in for a rare start. He deserves sympathy rather than criticism because this was the very definition of a hiding to nothing and it was no surprise when he was replaced at half-time. Liverpool were vastly superior, which can happen, but what was inexcusable was United's lack of fight, heart and even tackling as they looked a beaten team from the moment Diaz put them behind. There was a very slight improvement after the break - it could not get worse - but even so this was a performance coupled with a dreadful attitude that was an embarrassment to a club of Manchester United's stature.All the United reaction, in one place",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60724991

""To score two goals was brilliant.""It was always my dream to play in the Premier League and I'm so happy for today. I want to be a legend here.""Guimaraes was Newcastle's first big signing under their new owners, joining from Lyon in the January transfer window for an initial £35m.He has helped provide the impetus to push the Magpies towards safety and despite arriving as a defensive midfielder, the 24-year-old now has three goals from five Premier League starts.Newcastle United 2-1 Leicester City: Eddie Howe pleased with stoppage-time winner""Goals weren't necessarily one of the areas where we felt he would enhance us as a team, but he's scored some key goals for us,"" said Newcastle manager Eddie Howe.""I'm really pleased with him today. I thought he was magnificent in every aspect, especially out of possession, because we struggled to get control of the ball for any large periods of the game.""Guimaraes' winner made it five straight home victories for Newcastle and he was booked for taking his shirt off in celebration.The Magpies now have 37 points - 12 clear of the relegation zone and three behind ninth-placed Leicester, whose five-game unbeaten run came to a dramatic end.""He's an incredibly passionate individual,"" Howe added. ""He cares deeply whether we win or lose.""I love that about him because you need players that wear their heart on their sleeve and are prepared to give you everything on the pitch.

Manager Brendan Rodgers, though, made eight changes to freshen the team up.The Foxes have struggled to defend set-pieces this season yet they opened the scoring with a training-ground routine of their own, Lookman's eighth goal in all competitions this season capping a bright start.Ayoze Perez superbly laid on James Maddison's equaliser in Eindhoven and the Spaniard repeated the trick against his former club.Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall drilled a corner low towards the near post, where Perez's run put him in front of his marker and his deft flick with the outside of his right foot ran straight into the path of an unmarked Lookman. The forward's low strike was too powerful for Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka to keep out.But the visitors' Achilles heel was exposed again just 11 minutes later, from the very first corner they conceded.Newcastle centre-half Dan Burn leaned his 6ft 7in frame over Daniel Amartey to head down Jonjo Shelvey's inswinging delivery, before Guimaraes poked the ball goalwards from right in front of Schmeichel and then bundled in while both players were on the turf.At first glance it looked as though Guimaraes had knocked the ball from the Denmark keeper's grasp. However, the video assistant referee, Lee Mason, recommended referee Jarred Gillett looked at his pitchside monitor and replays showed the ball had been stuck between Schmeichel's legs, rather than his hands.Leicester have now conceded 17 goals from set-pieces in the Premier League this season - more than any other team.That leveller lifted the hosts and they finished the first half on top, before Leicester dominated possession after the break with Newcastle still the more threatening.But they failed to create any clear-cut chances until Burn sent a free header wide from a late corner, while Leicester substitute Kelechi Iheanacho went close at the other end.Willock then burst down the left wing and into the Leicester box, where Guimaraes was rewarded for his supporting run by sending the home crowd at St James' Park into raptures.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61055887

We're hoping he's OK - our thoughts are with him.""You could see it wasn't good from the reaction of the players. He looked distraught, but fingers crossed.""When you see Declan Rice come over and say it's not good, you know it's not. The lad himself put his hand up, and he doesn't usually go down.""It could be the end of his season, but there is a squad here ready to play.

Those are the chances that will need to be converted if Burnley are to achieve the unlikely and retain the top-flight status.In the end, the Clarets were punished, courtesy of Soucek's shoulder as he connected with Manuel Lanzini's free-kick.As the Hammers pushed on for the winner, Pope stood firm and showed the form that resulted in an England call-up last month.

He has also moved on to 99 career Premier League goals.United can move level on points with fourth-placed Spurs if they win at Liverpool on Tuesday.For Norwich the outcome was a major blow to their faint hopes of avoiding the drop.

Ben Gibson was dispossessed in his own penalty area as Norwich tried to move the ball forward from a goal-kick, allowing Anthony Elanga to find Ronaldo who applied the first-time finish.Ronaldo's second was one of the towering headers he has produced so often down the years, climbing highest to reach Alex Telles' corner and power past Tim Krul.The winner was typical of the man. With the pressure on and all eyes trained on him, Ronaldo puffed his chest out after Elanga had been fouled on the edge of the area, ran up and belted his shot into the net off the inside of a post.It was a quite sensational effort and brought a crowd simmering with discontent to their feet.Norwich expose poor defendingMan Utd 3-2 Norwich: Smith disappointed at conceding three 'really poor goals'The celebrations at the final whistle must have felt like a dagger to the heart for Norwich boss Smith.They also masked some pretty shocking defending from the hosts, the type of stuff seen all too often down the years and which has left many of the club's fans in such a state of fury - some even missed the start of the game as part of a pre-match protest.Man Utd fans protest against Glazer Family ownership before Norwich matchNorwich's opener was a case in point.Pukki was on his own when he took possession on the right-hand side of the area, then picked out Dowell, who was also totally unmarked as he put the ball past David de Gea from six yards.Pukki was then similarly alone seven minutes after the re-start as he pulled the visitors level.Milton Rashica had a shot turned round the post at full stretch by De Gea and Sam Byram headed over at the far post. At that point, Smith must have thought a famous win was on the cards.Ronaldo had other ideas. Norwich's fight for survival continues.

They had also won only one of their past 12 meetings with Arsenal in the Premier League.The hosts had Forster to thank for keeping the score goalless in the early stages of the first half, the veteran goalkeeper getting down low to palm Gabriel Martinelli's curling shot past the post before brilliantly tipping Saka's close-range effort over the bar following an error from Valery.Although the Gunners continued to dominate possession as the half wore on, they lacked the tempo to create further openings against a resolute and defensively organised Southampton, who punished Arsenal when Bednarek fired home his fourth goal of the season with a minute of the first half remaining.When Arsenal did manage to penetrate the Saints rearguard late in the second half, they found Forster in inspired form. The 34-year-old did magnificently to parry Smith Rowe's goal-bound effort wide before getting in the way of a low Saka shot.Forster also managed to get his fingertips to Xhaka's curling strike with the clock ticking towards 90 minutes - although the Switzerland international's effort may have been heading narrowly wide.Southampton 1-0 Arsenal: Ralph Hasenhuttl pleased with 'important' three points for Saints""It wasn't so sure he could play today,"" Saints manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told BBC Match of the Day when asked about Forster's display.

Ismaila Sarr and Dennis were trying to combine and restore parity for Watford, but they struggled to impose themselves.But the tide turned in the first 10 minutes of the second half. At one end, Ivan Toney squandered a chance to double Brentford's lead, before Dennis fired home from a tight angle to make it 1-1.Initially disallowed for offside after Sarr's flick on from Moussa Sissoko's cross, VAR intervened and the goal counted to give Vicarage Road an entirely new impetus.The home side pushed for a crucial winner, and after hitting the bar with a free-kick through Dennis, Louza somehow failed to score from an open goal before Jansson provided the Bees' sting in the tail.Watford pay the price for poor first halfWatford 1-2 Brentford: Roy Hodgson disappointed with ""harsh"" Hornets defeatThere was enough character and energy in the Watford second half performance to take something from the game, and they will rue Louza's chance for a long time, but in truth, their first-half display summed up their issues.Boss Roy Hodgson looked dismayed on the touchline as his side failed to show the sort of desire and purpose required in their position.In Sarr and Dennis, the Hornets have two potent attacking players, but once again, they showed their soft underbelly, particularly with the goal they conceded.They hit the bar and the post, so there was bad luck - but evidence of why they are struggling was there once again.Hodgson bemoaned his side's luck in front of goal but admitted time is running out for his side.""Someone up there doesn't like us,"" he told BBC Sport. ""Our first-half performance was nowhere near good enough, we conceded a very poor goal so that was very disappointing considering how much we built the game up with the players during the week. They recognised the game needed to be built up because it was one of the last-chance games we'd have.""We haven't been lucky, but that doesn't alter the fact we haven't been good enough either. Today we should have been congratulating ourselves, if that is the right word, on a 1-1 draw. I didn't think we deserved to be contemplating another home defeat; taking the second half, that is probably the best we've offered our home fans. That doesn't say much.""Bees can prepare for another top-flight campaignWatford 1-2 Brentford: Frank praises Brentford's character after ""fantastic"" winRelegation looked a real possibility for Brentford some weeks ago, and it wasn't really an issue coming into this game, but now they really can look forward to another season.Christian Eriksen has made the difference since his arrival, and he again showed why he was such a key player, even if his impact waned as the game progressed.Thomas Frank praised his side's character after they secured three points in the latter stages once again.""[It was a] crazy, crazy finish,"" he said. ""The third time we've won in the last minute; that is a credit to the boys and their character. Through the game, we gave very little away. First half, we were slightly better; second half, Watford were better than us, no doubt. Then you think, 'okay, take a point. If you can't win, don't lose'.""I am very pleased with [Christian] Norgaard; he is a key player but adding goals is fantastic. Pontus [Jansson] has been very dangerous, big determination, very disciplined. I'm very happy he got this goal.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61048519
235,Brentford 2-0 West Ham United: Hosts deliver huge blow to Hammers' top-four hopes,SUN 10 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Brentford completed their first league double over West Ham since the 1953-54 seasonBrentford delivered a huge blow to West Ham's top-four hopes as the Bees moved further clear of the relegation places with victory in west London.Second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney saw Thomas Frank's side climb to 13th in the table, 12 points clear of the bottom three, to all but confirm their Premier League safety.Mbeumo fired in from Toney's pass shortly after half-time, before turning provider for his team-mate as Toney headed in after 64 minutes.""I'm very proud. It was a top performance against a very good side who are in the quarter-final of the Europa League and fighting for a Champions League spot,"" said manager Frank.""It was close to a complete performance. The way we did it shows how far we've come. It's a combination of a top performance and a good win.""He added: ""Of course I looked at the table, but I want to focus on the next game.""The hosts had appeared the more likely to break the deadlock before half-time, but the heavily involved Mbeumo headed at Lukasz Fabianski and also saw a powerful strike pushed away by the West Ham goalkeeper.The visitors managed only one shot on target - a first-half Tomas Soucek header - in a subdued display, while Kurt Zouma was forced off early with an ankle problem ahead of Thursday's Europa League quarter-final second leg in Lyon.The Hammers remain sixth, six points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham in the race for Champions League football, having also played a game more than Spurs.Reaction to Brentford v West Ham, plus the rest of Sunday's Premier League action'A top performance against a very good side' - Thomas Frank's reaction'I don't have any complaints' - David MoyesBrentford continue fine end to first Premier League seasonFrank 'very proud' of Brentford performanceThere was no shortage of motivation for West Ham, after defeats for fellow top-four hopefuls Arsenal and Manchester United on Saturday left the fight for the European positions wide open.But, with the game falling between two huge meetings with Lyon, the Hammers struggled against a Brentford side full of confidence following their memorable 4-1 win over Chelsea last week.Instead, it was the hosts who maintained their fine form at the end of their first Premier League season, deservedly securing a fourth win in five league games.That upturn in results has coincided with the signing of Christian Eriksen, who once again produced a superb midfield display to offer the base for Brentford's superior attacking output. The hosts had been by far the more fluent in the final third in the opening 45 minutes, recording nine shots to the Hammers' two, but Mbeumo in particular was unable to capitalise with any of his five attempts.No complaints with West Ham loss - MoyesThey made their chances count in the second half, though, as the 22-year-old Mbeumo seized his first opportunity after the restart, before his looping cross allowed Toney to put the game beyond West Ham.David Moyes called on Said Benrahma and Nikola Vlasic from the bench in the hope of inspiring a fightback, with Benrahma seeing a deflected effort drop on to the roof of the net.Brentford had further chances to extend their advantage too, Mbeumo notably shooting over at close range, but their misses did not prove costly as another excellent result was secured.It is now all eyes on Lyon for West Ham, who must rest up and regroup quickly as they attempt to reach the club's first European semi-final since 1976. ""I don't have any complaints at all, we weren't really at it from the start,"" said West Ham boss Moyes. ""There are mitigating circumstances. We had a tough game on Thursday and the Thursday-Sunday schedule is not ideal. For the most part this season we've been very good but today felt like one too many.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970968

""It's a dream come true to score in the Premier League. I have dreamt it since I was a little boy. I have come close but I am so happy today.""The 23-year-old's moments of quality proved telling in a fixture both sides could have been forgiven for looking past given their mid-table status and with key cup fixtures in the coming week.Palace - who missed early chances through Wilfried Zaha, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Joachim Andersen - refused to give in after the break and Youri Tielemans' foul on Jordan Ayew in the penalty area offered them a route back into the match.Zaha saw his penalty saved and when VAR pointed to encroachment in the area by home defender Caglar Soyuncu, his retaken penalty was also palmed away by Kasper Schmeichel, only for the Ivory Coast international to head in the rebound.It prompted a spirited 10 minutes from Palace - who went close through a Jeffrey Schlupp flick - but their seven-game unbeaten run ends. Leicester now have four wins and a draw from their past six league games - form that lifts them to ninth in the table, one place above the beaten visitors.Visit our Leicester City pageGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content'He typifies everything we want to be'Dewsbury-Hall is what Leicester have been missing - RodgersA closely matched game - possession was 50-50, while Leicester managed just one more shot than their visitors - was arguably to be expected given two sides enjoying very similar fortunes. Leicester did not pick up a league win for all of January and February but have found late-season form. Palace won just once over the same period and have themselves found momentum deep in the campaign.Throw in the fact that Leicester face a key Europa Conference League second leg against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday while Palace have one eye on next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea and it would be easy to see why either side might have opted to preserve energy.And Leicester's seven changes from their 0-0 first-leg draw with PSV appeared to cause a lack of cohesion that Palace might have exploited.But the visitors were unable to take half-chances and Dewsbury-Hall made them pay by reversing a defence-splitting pass into Lookman's path for the opener before patiently creating shooting space of his own for a rifled second.The 23-year-old was certainly not coasting. He ran further than anyone else on the pitch - clocking 11.3km - and hit a higher top speed than anyone in his sprints.""Since he's broken into the team I felt throughout the season it was what we were missing,"" Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said of Dewsbury-Hall. ""The team was missing intensity and pressure and he has brought that. He typifies everything we want to be. He has good industry, a cultured left foot and he's very honest.""Palace, who have not ended a top-flight campaign higher than 10th since finishing third 1990-91, will rue a period late in the first half when they slackened off and let the Foxes in. Dewsbury-Hall's assist saw them opened too easily, while his goal owed much to a missed clearance by Marc Guehi in the build-up.When they did rally, Zaha was integral to the improvement and his form will offer confidence for next week's semi-final. After scoring, he fought admirably to conjure an equaliser, notably when teeing up Schlupp who saw his flick blocked by a sea of Leicester bodies.Damage was done in first half - Palace boss Vieira",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60970974

Three of their final seven matches include teams challenging for Europe - West Ham (home), Tottenham (home) and Manchester United (away).""We want to take it to the last game, but we know how hard it could be,"" added Smith. ""Hopefully we can find that resilience in the results.""Pukki's goal was his 20th in the Premier League, making him Norwich's third top scorer in the competition (behind Chris Sutton on 33 and Grant Holt on 23)Even before Lees-Melou's goal, Milot Rashica forced Nick Pope into a diving save, while the Burnley keeper denied Pukki with his legs.Just as impressive for Smith was his side's performance at the back.Norwich made several vital blocks to frustrate Burnley, including one by former Clarets defender Ben Gibson to keep out Ashley Westwood's volley.In the closing stages, Norwich's Grant Hanley headed against the bar while Pope denied Rashica before Pukki had home fans celebrating a rare win.Burnley's survival hopes suffer major setbackDefeat at Norwich a big step backwards - DycheCornet will have nightmares about his 65th-minute miss, just days after he left the pitch at Turf Moor with fans singing his name following his late winner against Everton.He looked certain to equalise as he slid to meet Dwight McNeil's lovely pass, but somehow put it wide as Burnley failed to score for the 15th time in the league this season.""We can't miss chances like that,"" Dyche said. ""He's done well for us this season.

238,Manchester City 2-2 Liverpool: Top two draw to maintain pulsating title race,SUN 10 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Manchester City retained their slender one-point advantage at the top of the Premier League as they fought out a classic draw with closest rivals Liverpool at Etihad Stadium.The meeting between the country's two outstanding sides lived up to its pre-match billing and in the end there was nothing to separate them, with the destination of the title still hanging in the balance with seven games remaining. City flew out of the blocks to take an early lead through Kevin de Bruyne's deflected strike but Liverpool were quickly on terms when Diogo Jota turned home Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass. Pep Guardiola's side dominated a magnificent first 45 minutes but failed to convert a host of chances before Gabriel Jesus stole in behind Alexander-Arnold to restore their lead from Joao Cancelo's cross nine minutes before the break. Liverpool had been strangely nervous but came out rejuvenated after the re-start, equalising when Sadio Mane celebrated his 30th birthday by scoring from Mohamed Salah's perfect pass in the 47th minute. Raheem Sterling had a goal ruled out for offside as both sides pressed for a winner in this superb match, with City substitute Riyad Mahrez wasting a chance to win it in the dying seconds as he lifted his finish over the top.'Neither of top two deserve to finish second' - Shearer column on title race'Title rivals deliver classic that lives up to the hype''A result we have to live with' - KloppWhere do teams' quadruple and Treble bids stand?Man City still in control... justThe two sides drew 2-2 at Anfield in October in their last meeting in the Premier LeagueManchester City and manager Pep Guardiola may regret their failure to turn first-half superiority into a more meaningful advantage but they will not be wholly dissatisfied with the outcome. There will certainly be no dissatisfaction with City's level of performance, which was outstanding apart from a sloppy first 15 minutes at the start of the second half, during which Liverpool equalised and the reigning Premier League champions were on the back foot. City's supporters seemed happy enough with the final outcome, clearly living on their nerves in the closing stages knowing Liverpool's threat and their capacity to strike at any time. De Bruyne was at his imperious best, although Sterling struggled against his former club, his day summed up when arguably his most composed piece of play in a frenetic afternoon saw a low finish past Alisson ruled out for offside, while Liverpool's keeper also denied him in the opening moments of the game.City's advantage at the top of the table is just that one point but knowing how formidable Liverpool's challenge can be, you suspect Guardiola will settle for it with only seven games left and a fixture list that looks manageable. He would have preferred the victory that would have opened up a crucial gap but City have survived their toughest fixture of the season against their most dangerous opponents largely unscathed. City were better than Liverpool – GuardiolaMan City's De Bruyne wins your player of the matchReaction to the draw at Etihad StadiumLiverpool still in the huntLiverpool's Sadio Mane scored 46 seconds into the second half to make it 2-2This was never going to be the so-called title decider, no matter what the outcome. There is still the capacity for too many potential twists and turns to call it so soon. Liverpool came into the game in outstanding form, on the back of 10 straight league wins and a club record eight successive away wins in all competitions. And yet, they started with uncharacteristic unease and hesitancy, especially at the back where there were several nervous moments. Even when they are off their best, Liverpool still possess ever-present menace and the poacher supreme Jota settled Jurgen Klopp's side with a trademark finish for his 15th Premier League goal of the season. Liverpool were fortunate to be only 2-1 down at half-time, although City keeper Ederson sent palpitations around Etihad Stadium when he lost control of the ball on his goal-line with Jota in close attendance, recovering to show nerves of steel and regain his poise. Klopp clearly delivered some stern messages to his players at the break and Liverpool were much more themselves in the second half, Mane striking almost immediately and their pressing game finally rushing City into mistakes. Liverpool may still be in second place but they are right in this title hunt. Like Guardiola, Klopp would have preferred all three points but he will not be unhappy with one from this wonderful Premier League spectacle.

239,Everton 1-0 Manchester United: Anthony Gordon strike boosts Toffees' survival hopes,SAT 09 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Everton secured what could prove a priceless victory in their battle to avoid relegation as lacklustre Manchester United were beaten at Goodison Park. Frank Lampard's side were plunged into even deeper crisis when they lost at fellow strugglers Burnley in midweek to leave them facing the prospect of dropping into the bottom three this weekend if results went against them. In a game low on quality but high in tension, Everton's victory came courtesy of Anthony Gordon's 27th-minute drive, which took a heavy deflection off United captain Harry Maguire to leave keeper David de Gea wrong-footed. Everton keeper Jordan Pickford made two important early saves from Marcus Rashford and a vital late block from Cristiano Ronaldo, but there was rarely any sense of siege as United lacked urgency, failing to break through in another blow to their hopes of making the Premier League's top four.Everton deliver on Lampard's promise of 'fight, focus and desire'De Gea says Red Devils 'not good enough' after defeat at EvertonFollow reaction to Everton v Man Utd plus live text and radio commentary of the rest of Saturday's Premier League gamesEverton show grit they will needBig win, but Everton need to go again, says boss Frank LampardThis could be a huge result in Everton's season, stopping the rot and lifting some of those dark clouds that were starting to gather over Goodison.Everton's win was as far from a classic as it is possible to be but in the wider context it could mean more than so many others this season.Frank Lampard's side remain in trouble but the psychological lift provided by this victory, which removes the prospect of dropping into the bottom three for now at least, saw an explosion of joy around this famous old stadium when referee Jon Moss blew the final whistle.Everton dug deep for victory and had several figures who personified exactly what they will need if they are to maintain their Premier League status.Everton have won five and lost eight in all competitions under Frank Lampard, with all five wins at Goodison ParkIt was fitting that Gordon was the match-winner, the local hero loved by Everton fans for his tireless energy and invention. The supporters warm to him because of his attitude and his deflected strike was a fitting reward.Richarlison is another who has been exempt from criticism, apart from the fact he might have scored more goals. The Brazil striker's work-rate is exceptional, chasing down every lost cause and he brought Goodison Park to its feet in the second half when he juggled the ball on his head by the touchline before winning a corner. He reacted by pumping his fists at the Gwladys Street End to raise the temperature inside an already frantic stadium.And, once more, goalkeeper Pickford made a vital contribution, denying Rashford twice early on as well as Paul Pogba and Ronaldo after the break.The deafening noise at the final whistle told the story, as Lampard joined in celebrations with the fans at the conclusion of a win that cannot be over-valued.Embarrassing display by Red DevilsDifficult to finish in top four, says Manchester United interim boss Ralf RangnickManchester United were still chasing a place in the top four and a slot in next season's Champions League at kick-off. They played as if no-one had told them. United's display was embarrassingly mediocre, a gift for an Everton side looking anywhere for assistance to ease their own troubles. It seems certain Ajax coach Erik ten Hag will be United's next manager, and if he was watching this he will have a notebook full of uncomplimentary references and names crossed out of his plans. Everton were nervous and tense but were ultimately placed under no serious pressure by a United side strolling around without the slightest sense of urgency, without any sense they still had something to fight for this season. The passing was sloppy, so many physical challenges were lost. It was a flat performance that suggests these players have given up on getting any inspiration from interim manager Ralf Rangnick - and he could be forgiven for giving up on them, so abject was this performance. It was only in the final minutes that Everton showed any serious signs of panic in defence, and the biggest condemnation of United is that Lampard's struggling side were themselves average but still deserved the win because they were prepared to fight to earn it. Ronaldo's late yellow card for kicking the ball away could also be marked down as a rare act of aggression rather than the petulance it was, such was the timid, desperate nature of their performance. If, as is expected, Ten Hag is the next United manager, what a task he is taking on. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963791
240,Arsenal 1-2 Brighton: Gunners boss Mikel Arteta 'concerned' by performance in home defeat,SAT 09 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Trossard curled home a smart opener for BrightonArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said he was ""concerned"" by his side's performance as they handed the initiative in the race for Champions League qualification to rivals Tottenham with a deserved defeat by Brighton at Emirates Stadium.Brighton - seven games without a victory before kick-off - frustrated the home side with their organisation and efficient forward play in a game where Arsenal failed to look threatening until they mustered a desperate late push.Leandro Trossard's curling first-half finish - after a fine assist by the impressive Enock Mwepu - gave Graham Potter's side something to build on.And after Gabriel Martinelli appeared to have headed Arsenal level moments before the break - only for a four-minute VAR check to rule him offside - Brighton remained solid before doubling their lead with a superb Mwepu finish.The Zambia midfielder side-footed home with power from the edge of the box to cap a rounded individual display and produce a look of disbelief on the face of Arteta.""We made it really difficult for ourselves,"" Arteta told BBC Sport. ""We were sloppy, we had no purpose to attack, we were really imprecise and we didn't want to play forward.""There are many games to play but we have to be concerned about that performance, especially first half.""Arteta's side rallied late on with Martin Odegaard firing home from range via a deflection but they stay fifth - three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who won 4-0 at Aston Villa later on Saturday - while Potter's Brighton move up to 11th after just a fourth win in 26 league games.Follow text updates from Arsenal-Brighton, plus Saturday's Premier League latestGo straight to all the best Arsenal contentVisit our Brighton & Hove Albion pageMwepu stars as Arsenal falterArteta disappointed by 'sloppy' ArsenalWere it not for their fine start to the season, Brighton might well have been worrying about escaping the bottom three, such has been their recent run of results. Potter's side had scored just one goal in their previous seven league games and failed to find the net with 31 attempts in last week's 0-0 draw with Norwich. This win, though, saw them take their opportunities and Potter later praised the way they were able to ""hang on and suffer"".Arsenal were simply lacklustre and showed little in the way of a response to what Arteta described as an ""unacceptable"" display in Monday's 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace.It took 25 minutes for an attempt of note when Gabriel headed wide and, other than Martinelli's ruled-out finish from a yard out, they were largely limited to minor glimpses of goal until the closing stages.Lewis Dunk blocked brilliantly to deny Emile Smith Rowe at 1-0 and substitute Nicolas Pepe at 2-0, Yves Bissouma diligently broke up attacks and Marc Cucurella mixed his role in a back three with well-timed forays forward.Mwepu - who only returned from three months out with injury last week - showed exactly what Brighton have been missing. He produced an assist and a goal, won nine duels - a game high - and intercepted the ball more than anyone on the pitch.Potter called on Mwepu and Bissouma to drop into his defensive line for parts of the second half in a fluid tactical display and they shouldered the responsibility admirably.Win at Arsenal gives Brighton confidence and belief - PotterThe game saw seven bookings - as many as there were shots on target - and Arteta may point to a stop-start match as a reason for his side's struggle to find momentum.When they did in the closing 10 minutes, Albert Sambi Lokonga whistled a shot wide, Odegaard and substitute Eddie Nketiah both hit the bar during the same attack and seconds later the deficit was halved.Odegaard's long-range effort deflected beyond the diving Sanchez, prompting a final few minutes in which Arsenal pressed keenly for a point they did not deserve.They saw 65% of the ball and had 20 shots - 16 off target - but Brighton's poise for long spells merited this win.Arsenal will need to put two abject displays behind them quickly if they are to claim that crucial fourth-place at the end of their eight-game run-in.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963800

Despite the absence of £97.5m forward Romelu Lukaku because of injury and captain Cesar Azpilicueta after a positive coronavirus test, they got back on track before another big week that will help shape their season.They face a huge challenge to turn around their Champions League quarter-final with Real in the Bernabeu on Tuesday before heading to Wembley to face Crystal Palace in next Sunday's FA Cup semi-final - their most realistic hope of a major domestic trophy as it stands.Chelsea were 'strong' and 'focused' in big win at Saints - TuchelWerner could yet play a big part in how Chelsea's season finishes.Without a Premier League goal since scoring against Southampton last October, he was back to his very best against Saints and should have finished with a hat-trick.The first of his two goals was magnificent with the former RB Leipzig player having too much pace for the chasing Jan Bednarek before going round Forster and finishing.Southampton have lost three consecutive Premier League games at St Mary's, this after having only lost three of their previous 20 home league matches beforehand.Sorry Saints surrender without a fightThis was a sorry performance by Saints on an afternoon which revived painful memories of those two 9-0 defeats against Manchester United in February 2021 and Leicester in October 2019 under Hasenhuttl. From the opening minute it was far too easy for Chelsea and but for Forster, who produced a string of fine stops as Chelsea peppered his goal with 14 attempts on target, they would have suffered an even more embarrassing defeat.The Saints fans who stayed to the bitter end made their feelings known after this utter capitulation signalled a fourth straight home defeat in all competitions.Saints lacked 'everything' against Chelsea - HasenhuttlFortunately Southampton appear safe in the table.

""We can see that the form of many players and the overall mentality of the group has grown so much.""That's really helped us get to where we are right now.""The result lifts Leeds nine points clear of the relegation zone - although they have played three games more than 18th-placed Burnley, who travel to bottom club Norwich on Sunday.""It's been a real pleasure to be their coach,"" Marsch told BBC Match of the Day. ""[The players] are obviously hungry to stay in the league, but they are hungry to try to develop and get better and be the best they can be.""Every day we're talking about some new topics and trying to fine-tune a lot of the principles we want to put in place. We have to keep going.""Visit our Watford pageGo straight to all the best Leeds United contentReaction to Watford 0-3 Leeds and the rest of Saturday's Premier League actionWasteful Hornets punished by LeedsWatford manager Roy Hodgson will have taken heart from his side's spirited display against Liverpool last weekend but, as was the case at Anfield, the Hornets were undone by poor finishing against the Whites and now find themselves six points adrift of safety with seven matches left to play.They had the better chances before Raphinha's well-taken opener, Louza sending a curling free-kick inches wide before Illan Meslier got his fingertips to Hernandez's inswinging cross-shot from the left.Sarr was also thwarted by Meslier after racing on to Emmanuel Dennis' raking pass, but his effort would not have counted as he was in an offside position.The Senegal winger missed an even better opportunity in the second half with the score at 1-0, sending a wild strike past Meslier's left-hand post - an effort which sums up Watford's plight.Hodgson will be furious at the manner of Leeds' second goal, as Kamara's attempted clearance was deflected into Rodrigo's path by Samir, allowing the Spaniard to round Foster and calmly slide into an empty net.The visitors, who kept their first clean sheet in 18 Premier League matches at Vicarage Road, put the seal on a vital victory five minutes from time when Harrison drilled an unstoppable shot past Foster for his third goal in as many games.The win puts Leeds within touching distance of safety, but Watford's prospects look bleak after slipping to a ninth consecutive home defeat.With trips to Crystal Palace, Manchester City and Chelsea still to come before the end of the season, the Hornets will need to improve their tally of seven points out of a possible 45 at Vicarage Road this term to stand any chance of avoiding the drop.""I don't think the challenge has altered enormously,"" Hodgson said afterwards. ""That's a few more points that we could have had that we haven't taken, but there are seven games left - four of them at home - and the players have got to find a way of putting this game behind them.""They haven't lost by playing particularly badly, they've lost because the other team took their chances and now we have to get back in the right frame of mind for Brentford [next Saturday].""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963796
243,Aston Villa 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur: Son Heung-min hat-trick keeps Spurs on track for top four,SAT 09 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Son Heung-min's hat-trick was his second in the Premier League, having netted four goals in a 5-2 win at Southampton in September 2020Son Heung-min's hat-trick kept Tottenham's Premier League top-four destiny in their own hands as Spurs produced a masterclass in clinical finishing to thrash Aston Villa.After the South Korea striker steered the visitors into an early lead, Spurs withstood a Villa onslaught to remain ahead at the interval with veteran goalkeeper Hugo Lloris making a string of superb saves.But they cruised to victory with a breathtaking, counter-attacking second-half performance as Son swept home two more fine finishes, either side of an equally elegant strike from Dejan Kulusevski.A fourth-successive win moved Antonio Conte's side three points above north London rivals Arsenal - beaten at home by Brighton earlier on Saturday - in the race for the fourth Champions League spot.Villa, meanwhile, were left to reflect on a fourth-straight defeat, despite dominating long spells of the first half, as returning striker Danny Ings wasted two glorious chances to bring them level. Follow reaction to Aston Villa v Tottenham and Saturday's other Premier League matchesSon shines - but he's far from alone for SpursWhile the scoreline failed to reflect the overall balance of play - or chances created - in the West Midlands, it was Spurs who possessed the difference-making individual talents. Chief among them, of course, was Son, who seemingly never ceases to amaze - his first and third goals beautifully struck first-time efforts that both went in off the post, with a composed one-on-one finish to beat Emi Martinez in between.On-loan Juventus midfielder Kulusevski again impressed, teeing up Son for his hat-trick after firing an accurate finish through the legs of Tyrone Mings and past Martinez to put the result beyond doubt.Dejan Kulusevski's goal was his third in 11 league games since joining Spurs on loan from Juventus in JanuaryHarry Kane took a back seat but was still involved in three of the goals, flicking on headers in the build-up to two, but Lloris was arguably Spurs' stand-out performer.The France goalkeeper made excellent first-half stops to thwart Jacob Ramsey's solo run and shot, John McGinn's 25-yard thunderbolt and Philippe Coutinho's cheeky near-post free-kick.Only three weeks ago, Spurs sat eighth, six points off fourth place - a position they now proudly hold, even if Arsenal do have a game in hand.Tottenham, though, have a superior goal difference - boosted by this win - and an easier run-in on paper with Brighton, Brentford, Burnley and Norwich among their final seven opponents, while Arsenal meet Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham among their next four.Ings' day to forget as Villa's Spurs curse strikes againTottenham are very much becoming Villa's bogey side - they have won 14 of the past 18 Premier League meetings between the sides and this was their seventh-straight success at Villa Park. Despite Son's early opener, it did not look like ending that way for the majority of the first half though as Villa laid siege to the visitors' goal.While Lloris deserves the plaudits for his impressive display, the hosts were also guilty of profligate finishing, with Ings - still yet to truly find his feet at Villa with just five goals since his £25m summer move from Southampton - the chief culprit.Twice he was afforded excellent chances on the volley - one from a dinked Coutinho set-piece and then an Ollie Watkins flick-on - but he scuffed both, one straight at Lloris and the other badly wide.Watkins also sent a free header over from six yards as Steven Gerrard suffered his heaviest defeat as Villa boss.Scoreline is harsh on Villa - Gerrard",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60963795
244,Newcastle 1-0 Wolves: Chris Wood penalty earns key win for Eddie Howe's side,FRI 08 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Jose Sa fouled Chris Wood in the key moment of the matchNewcastle took a huge step towards Premier League survival as Chris Wood's penalty proved enough to beat a blunt Wolves side at St James' Park. The January signing slammed home the second-half winner at the Gallowgate End after being fouled by Wolves keeper Jose Sa at the end of a flowing team move.VAR checked if Sa had made adequate contact, after an earlier review had denied Wood in the first half, when he saw a goal chalked off because team-mate Bruno Guimaraes was narrowly offside in the build-up.Wolves failed to touch the ball in the Newcastle area in a dire opening half and manager Bruno Lage will wonder why it took until the 80th minute for his side to work home keeper Martin Dubravka when Fabio Silva forced a diving save.Newcastle - who saw Allan Saint-Maximin fire over the bar before Wood's goal and Guimaraes go close to adding a second - thoroughly deserved to end a run of three straight defeats with this win.It moves them 10 points clear of the relegation zone - though 18th-placed Burnley have two games in hand - while Wolves stay eighth and lose crucial ground in their push for a Europa League spot.""It has put us in a stronger position but I still think we have work to do,"" boss Eddie Howe told BBC Sport. ""The home games are key for us but we want to pick up points wherever we go.""At this stage of the season, it is about results. We are well aware we need to continue to get points. I think it's results over performances at the moment. There will be a time when we can evolve.""Sloppy Wolves let Newcastle profitWood's finish (left) sealed Newcastle's fourth win in a row at homeHowe had reason to be ecstatic, having taken over a side who were 19th in the table and five points from safety in November. The Newcastle boss has a quote which reads ""make each day your masterpiece"" on a wall in his office. This display was by no means joyful or pretty in its crafting, but it was one where Newcastle were always the likelier winners thanks to their consistent effort and sporadic quality across the 90 minutes.Wolves were fortunate when VAR chalked off Wood's close-range finish in the first half. Guimaraes raced on to a superb flick by substitute Miguel Almiron - on for the injured Ryan Fraser - and was fractionally offside.In the aftermath, Wolves captain Conor Coady could be seen screaming at team-mates in a bid to rise some kind of energy and application. It never really arrived and, gradually, the home side started to create half-chances after the break until Saint-Maximin and Joelinton combined to send Wood clear in the game's key moment.Guimaraes celebrated Newcastle's goal with a fan and offered a rounded performance. The January signing completed 90% of his passes, won four tackles - more than any player on the pitch - and drew five fouls.Wood's finish ensured Newcastle beat a side in the top half of the table for the first time this season and also carried them to a fourth successive home win - their best run since March 2019.Lage was left wondering how his side - with eight away wins to their name this season - could be so poor, particularly in the first half.""In the second half we had clearer ideas,"" said Lage. ""The first five minutes of the second half, we were more aggressive in the final third than in the first 45 minutes. I think we missed a big opportunity.""Wolves are one win away from equalling their record mark of 16 victories in a Premier League-era top-flight season - set in 2018-19 - but their first-half display here set the tone for a night of despair. They delivered one cross in the first 45 minutes, compared with 14 after the break. In the opening half they completed 31% of their passes in the final third compared to 74% in the second period.It was a bemusing showing. A Europa League campaign is still well within reach but Wolves will need to find much more than they did here on a night where Newcastle took advantage to earn a key win in their bid for survival.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60950088
245,Burnley beat fellow strugglers Everton 3-2 in Premier League with Maxwel Cornet winner,WED 06 Apr 2022,premier-league,"Richarlison scored his sixth and seventh goals of the season for Everton but was distraught to end up on the losing sideMaxwel Cornet scored a late winner to earn Burnley a vital win over fellow strugglers Everton in their bid to remain in the Premier League. The Ivorian capitalised upon two poor errors by Jordan Pickford and Ben Godfrey in the 85th minute to earn Sean Dyche's side only their fourth league win of the season.It lifted them to within one point of safety behind Frank Lampard's fourth-bottom side. In an entertaining and feisty encounter, the hosts took a 12th-minute lead when an unmarked Nathan Collins scored at the back post from a corner. But the advantage did not last long as Richarlison stroked home the first of two penalties in the 18th minute when Ashley Westwood was adjudged to have tripped Anthony Gordon. His second came four minutes before half-time and was tinged with controversy. Despite Vitaliy Mykolenko being tripped by Aaron Lennon, referee Mike Dean did not think it amounted to a spot-kick, until he was advised by the video assistant referee to review it on the monitor and then overturned his decision. The home support showed their disgust with that call, but their mood improved after the break when a great burst by Charlie Taylor led to him crossing for Jay Rodriguez's equaliser in the 57th minute.And although Everton created the better chances as the second half wore on, Cornet's seventh goal of the season could not have been more crucial as it sent the home fans wild. By contrast, the Everton players and boss Lampard left the field dejected, with their 68-year stay in the top flight under serious pressure.  Devastating blow to Everton's survival hopesLampard frustrated by Everton 'mistakes'The victory was as morale-boosting for Burnley as it was devastating for Everton, who have earned only two wins from nine league games since Lampard replaced Rafael Benitez in January. With wet and blustery conditions, this had all the ingredients for a relegation scrap, something Burnley have had more experience of in recent years compared to the visitors. But Everton matched their opponents for much of the game, and were on top for most of the second half as they sought to earn a success that would boost their own survival hopes. Richarlison almost had a hat-trick when his overhead kick was saved by Nick Pope.Dominic Calvert-Lewin then headed over, while Gordon had a great opportunity blocked by James Tarkowski when clean through. However, as had been the case for much of the season, Everton were undone by individual errors as their wretched away form continued.  Pickford mis-kicked a clearance out of play with his right foot, which led to the throw-in from which Burnley got their winner. It was made worse when defender Godfrey also sliced a clearance from Matej Vydra's cross, allowing Cornet to finish. Everton now face a daunting task to stay in the league - and relegation would cause huge problems for a team that has registered heavy losses over the past three years. Cornet hands Clarets a lifelineDyche praises Burnley 'mentality'Burnley's stay in the Premier League has been less established than their opponents, but they showed the grit and determination needed to stay up. In both halves they started well and caused all sorts of problems from set-pieces, scoring for the first time in five games through Collins' early goal. They might have had cause to complain about both penalties, which the home fans certainly felt were soft. The second, via VAR, saw them vent their frustrations at referee Dean.But Rodriguez's goal was crucial in re-affirming their status in the game, and they defended well to deny Everton another. The fact they were gifted the winner will matter little to Dyche or Burnley's support, with fireworks being let off outside the stadium in celebration at the end. They also know they have a run-in which appears more favourable than that faced by Everton. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59403645

When you come here you have to compete, you have to win duels and second balls and be aggressive and we were none of those.""The Gunners would have moved above rivals Tottenham with victory or even a draw but fell behind early on through Jean-Philippe Mateta's header following a free-kick.Things got worse for the visitors a few minutes later when Jordan Ayew got away from two Arsenal defenders and bent a shot beyond Aaron Ramsdale.Arsenal showed some improvement after the break and should have at least got one back as Martin Odegaard shot wide when unmarked inside the box, while Eddie Nketiah hit the woodwork.Palace made sure of a hugely impressive win when Wilfried Zaha was brought down inside the box late on and the forward stepped up to convert the penalty.The victory, Palace's first at home in the league in 2022, moves them up to ninth while Arsenal remain fifth and outside the top four on goal difference, albeit with a game in hand.Tierney injury does not look good - ArtetaRead reaction to Crystal Palace's game with ArsenalGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace contentVisit our Arsenal pageAn opportunity missed by ArsenalA dreadful start to the season had seen the Gunners briefly flirting with the relegation places but they have been transformed as the campaign has gone on.They went into this game knowing they had a huge opportunity to put themselves in the driving seat for Champions League football next season with a win and they had every right to feel confident of getting it on the back of six wins in their last seven games.But they never got going against a tenacious Palace side as they lacked the same level of aggression as their hosts.Listen: Football Daily podcast - reaction as Palace thrash ArsenalArsenal have that game in a hand over Tottenham, so still have the opportunity to make amends for this poor performance and recent form suggests this display was an outlier.However, Arteta knows they will need to show significant improvement in the coming games to ensure they end the season in the top four, particularly after Spurs thrashed Newcastle 5-1 on Sunday.To make matters worse, Arsenal could be without full-back Kieran Tierney for a period of time as he missed the game with a knee injury, while midfielder Thomas Partey went off injured in the second half.Vieira gets one over his old team in some stylePatrick Vieira's side have lost only one of their past 11 matches in all competitionsPalace boss Vieira is a club legend at Arsenal following many years of dominating the middle of the park for the Gunners, and he came within seconds of a famous win at the home of his former side in October.Back then, an injury-time equaliser by Alexandre Lacazette broke Palace fans' hearts but there was nothing to spoil the party this time as Palace produced a stunning display.They were more aggressive than Arsenal and showed more desire, with every single member of the Palace team playing their part in what is undoubtedly one of the standout results of Vieira's impressive reign at Selhurst Park.""It was a really good team performance,"" said Vieria. ""There have been games where we performed well but didn't take our chances but in this game we performed well from the start and we managed to win the game and not concede.""I don't think it is the best performance, it is the performance we want and expect. At the beginning of the season we had some highs and lows.

Michail Antonio burst clear of the Everton defence and his shot was blocked by Pickford but the rebound fell to Jarrod Bowen, back in the side after recovering from a fractured foot, and he steered the ball into the unguarded net.Things then got worse for the visitors when captain Michael Keane was sent off midway through the half for his second bookable offence, following his second late challenge on Antonio. There was no way back for the visitors after that.Everton are 17th in the Premier League, three points clear of 18th-placed Watford.

Spurs, who beat Newcastle 5-1 later on Sunday, have a game in hand while fifth-placed Arsenal have played three games fewer than the Hammers.This result continues a hugely impressive season for David Moyes' side, who face Lyon in the first leg of the quarter-finals of the Europa League on Thursday with Barcelona a potential semi-final opponent if they get there.If they win that competition it would be their first European trophy since lifting the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965 and would secure a Champions League spot, regardless of their final Premier League position.At a packed London Stadium, Cresswell's brilliant free-kick gave them the lead and they had chances to make it 2-0 but Pablo Fornals shot just over and Antonio, after rounding Pickford, could only shoot into the side-netting from a tight angle.Those misses looked to have been costly when Holgate, a last-minute addition to the Everton side after Donny van de Beek was injured in the warm-up, hit a half-volley after Richarlison had nudged the ball into his path, with it bouncing off Fornals and past Lukasz Fabianski.But only a few minutes later Everton's Alex Iwobi lost possession, Antonio broke clear and Bowen scored the follow-up for his 13th goal of the season in all competitions.Everton's miserable away run continuesWest Ham 2-1 Everton: Toffees deserved a lot more - Frank LampardThe result continued a terrible run of form for Everton in matches played outside Goodison Park.

Norwich, meanwhile, remain eight points adrift of safety after a passive display.Maupay's big chance came just shy of the half-hour mark, after Sam Byram's handball was spotted by referee Simon Hooper.The French striker, though, shot high over the bar to mocking cheers from the travelling supporters.Brighton had created chances before that, with good play down the left from Leandro Trossard leading to a mishit shot from Maupay, before Danny Welbeck saw a close-range effort blocked.The hosts' lack of cutting edge continued to frustrate them after Maupay's spot-kick miss. Solly March and Alexis Mac Allister failed to hit the target numerous times, and the final ball was badly lacking.Trossard's attempts to spark the hosts into life led to a glorious chance for Joel Veltman 10 minutes after the restart. His quick feet won a corner, which the Dutchman headed goalwards, only to be denied by fellow countryman Tim Krul at point-blank range.Maupay and Veltman were denied by a Norwich rearguard marshalled superbly by Grant Hanley, in the face of relentless second-half pressure from the hosts.In the end, the Seagulls could find no way through, and remain goalless at home since mid-January.

Brentford produced a magnificent display to record their first win over Chelsea since 1939 as they came from behind to stun Thomas Tuchel's side with three goals in 10 minutes in the second half before adding a fourth late on to humiliate the Champions League holders. The Bees enjoyed the better of the first half but were punished for not taking chances when Antonio Rudiger flashed a brilliant 30-yard finish past David Raya three minutes after the restart.Brentford's response was instant and spectacular as Vitaly Janelt hammered home the equaliser two minutes later before the golden moment in the 54th minute as Bryan Mbeumo squared a pass for Eriksen to score in front of the joyous visiting support. And Brentford were not finished there, Janelt breaking clear again on the hour to beat Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy before substitute Yoane Wissa completed their glory day in the closing moments. Brentford are now on 33 points, 11 clear of Watford, who are third from bottom, and can now surely contemplate Premier League football again next season.Follow Saturday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Chelsea contentVisit our Brentford pageEriksen stars in fine victoryEriksen provided the story of this truly remarkable Brentford win with that first goal for the club since making his comeback with the Bees after suffering a cardiac arrest playing for Denmark against Finland at Euro 2020 in June. It was a wonderful moment but was simply the flourish on a quite brilliant team performance from Brentford, who thoroughly deserved one of the greatest victories in the club's history. The margin of the scoreline did not flatter them. Thomas Frank's side took the fight to Chelsea from the first whistle, with striker Ivan Toney having three presentable chances as they went right on the front foot. Chelsea 1-4 Brentford: Thomas Frank says win against Chelsea is best result of seasonIf there was any disappointment, it was the fact they did not cash in on that superiority, and they paid for it when Rudiger fired Chelsea in front. Brentford's response was truly outstanding, giving them the result that surely means they will stay in the Premier League next season. And there is no doubt Eriksen's presence has lifted those around him. Brentford have won all three games he has started since making his comeback as a substitute against Newcastle United in late February. Eriksen may be the star name but this was the complete all-round display, with Toney giving Chelsea's vulnerable defence a torrid time and Janelt providing the cutting edge. Brentford were also resolute in defence, with Frank and his players fully deserving the huge ovation they received from their ecstatic fans after the final whistle. Chelsea get what they deserveChelsea can have no complaints about this defeat or the embarrassing scoreline as they were abject in a performance that was completely out of character with their recent efforts. Tuchel's side won their six matches in March but were never fully switched on from first to last and paid the price. If there is any consolation for Tuchel - and he will have to search very hard to find any - it is that this did not come in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge. If they repeat this horrible defensive performance, and indeed their entire shambolic effort, their hopes of retaining the trophy they won last June might be over. Chelsea 1-4 Brentford: Thomas Tuchel says 'nobody saw second-half coming'Despite the usually reliable presence of Rudiger and Thiago Silva, Chelsea were never unable to control Brentford, who ran them ragged and actually should have scored more than four goals.Chelsea must hope this is a blip, rather like their 5-2 home loss to the eventually relegated West Brom last season, because they cannot afford this when Real Madrid come here this week.The likes of Karim Benzema would have been licking their lips watching this defensive fiasco.

""Southampton play intensely. I know the coach well and he has done a good job with his team.""For the most part I thought we defended well. We were organised. Maybe in the last phase of the match we were unlucky not to find more.""The group is confident. They are committed to playing the way I would like them to play.

Such is the England player's reputation that as soon as Kyle Walker-Peters was fouled near the edge of the Leeds box by Luke Ayling, a worried murmur spread among the home fans. They knew what was coming.Ward-Prowse duly delivered, curling the ball over the wall and past goalkeeper Illan Meslier to draw Saints level and ultimately earn them a point from an entertaining, end-to-end contest.Last season, the Saints midfielder was the only player in the Premier League to score more than one goal direct from a free-kick - managing four. This season, he leads the way with three, one more than Newcastle's Kieran Trippier.Not that they really need the points, with their tally of 36 surely enough to keep them clear of any relegation trouble, but Saints will feel they could have taken all three.But for a Meslier save and Stuart Dallas clearance off the line under pressure, Che Adams would have levelled before Ward-Prowse's moment of magic.Mohamed Elyounoussi also shot straight at Meslier from a good position in the box in the first half and they sparked some desperate last-ditch defending from the home side on a number of occasions after the break.Leeds 1-1 Southampton: Ralph Hasenhuttl says match was like ping pong""It was an intense game and a bit ping pong in some moments,"" said Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, whose side had lost their previous four matches.""I think in the end we had the better chances to win it.

That enabled the hosts to counter, with Jonny scoring with a great strike after Lucas Digne had blocked Fabio Silva's shot.It was Jonny's second goal in consecutive matches in only his sixth appearance of the season, after being out for 10 months with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.The hosts doubled their lead in the 36th minute in fortunate circumstances when Young, on in place of the injured Digne, slipped when trying to deal with Marcal's left-wing cross and headed into his own net.Ashley Young had only been on the pitch for 23 minutes when he scored an own goal to put Wolves 2-0 upNo Wolves collapse this week, justWolves threw away a 2-0 lead against Leeds before losing 3-2 on 18 March, and their fans would have been fearing a repeat late on at Molineux.Villa's best chances in the first half came from long distance, with Philippe Coutinho narrowly firing a free-kick over and Leon Bailey having an excellent effort tipped over by goalkeeper Jose Sa.Watkins, who scored for England in their 3-0 win over Ivory Coast on Tuesday, twice had chances to halve the deficit before Wolves substitute Hwang Hee-chan almost added another for the hosts within two minutes of coming on, but shot wide.When Watkins was fouled by Sa, he converted the penalty for his eighth Premier League goal of the season to set up a frantic finale.

And, asked to occupy the number nine position when he was introduced for the final 35 minutes, Rashford continued to look ill at ease.Rangnick provided detailed instructions as Rashford waited to come on and then, together with technical director Darren Fletcher, offered more as the game entered its final 20 minutes.Fleetingly, it looked like Rashford's world would turn.

Iheanacho chipped over from an acute angle after Jadon Sancho's stray backpass had sent him through before Fofana brought a superb save out of David de Gea with a header that was bound for the top corner.Rodgers thought Maddison had won it and questioned fourth official Martin Atkinson when the goal was ruled out.

Jack Harrison turned home the loose ball after Ayling had first struck a post to make it 2-1, then had the rebound cleared off the line.And three minutes later, after a Dan James effort had come back off the woodwork, Rodrigo's shot flew in as Conor Coady tried to clear off the line.Then, just as eight minutes of injury time was being signalled, Ayling reacted quickest as the ball bounced on the edge of the six-yard box and smashed it home before being mobbed by ecstatic team-mates.Breathless, bruising, brilliant - controversy and drama in Leeds' win at WolvesThe incident-packed game also included a protestor attempting to tie themselves to the Wolves goal when the ball was at the other end of the pitch in the second half.Unlike at Everton on Thursday, this time the stewards reacted quickly enough and dragged the culprit away.Leeds triumph amid the tensionRodrigo scored for the second game running as Leeds fought back in thrilling style at MolineuxThe desire for victory was seen in the melee on the touchline that followed Leeds' winner.Both sets of coaching staff got themselves in a push and shove, with Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips and Wolves defender Marcal continuing the verbals after order had been restored.Phillips had run across the pitch to celebrate Ayling's winner and was the only one pumped up as proceedings unfolded.By the end, Wolves coach Bruno Lage was reacting with fury at every decision from referee Friend that was not to his liking.Wolves 2-3 Leeds United: Bruno Lage confused by 'strange' Raul Jimenez red cardWhen he has cooled down, Lage will realise his side were the architects of their own downfall.Jimenez will argue he was unlucky to be sent off but it was a challenge the Mexican did not have to make, with his side already two goals ahead, controlling midfield and Leeds running out of personnel and ideas.At that stage, Joao Moutinho was running midfield and Willy Boly was outstanding at the back, Wolves having survived a couple of early scares as Rodrigo and Bamford failed to take their chances.The result cost them a place in the top six and ended a two-match winning sequence.They also lost the services of Ruben Neves as the midfielder was forced off halfway through the opening period.Wolves 2-3 Leeds United: Jesse Marsch impressed by determination of his sideBamford injury blowAfter an excellent week, Leeds' decision to replace the much-loved Marcelo Bielsa with Jesse Marsch is now looking like a masterstroke. Back-to-back last-gasp wins for only the second time this season has been a pretty impressive way to bounce back from six straight defeats and after such a long struggle, Leeds' top-flight future is looking more secure than it has done for some time.However, this victory, as memorable as it was, came with a heavy price, particularly for striker Bamford, who did not reach half-time in the third game of his latest comeback.When he made his England debut at the beginning of September, Bamford must have been looking forward to another memorable campaign after scoring 17 times on Leeds' triumphant return to the top flight.Within a fortnight, he suffered an ankle injury that ruled him out for three months and then immediately sustained a hamstring problem that kept him on the sidelines for another three months.His latest setback came as he landed awkwardly as he led a charge into the Wolves penalty area.Bamford immediately knew he could not continue and after walking slowly back to the dugout, slumped in his seat and pulled his shirt over his head in obvious disappointment.Had that been the only injury issue Marsch had to deal with, it would have been bad enough.That he also lost Diego Llorente and Mateusz Klich before half-time and goalkeeper Meslier after the collision that resulted in Jimenez's dismissal made a difficult situation totally disruptive.Klich's exit at least allowed for a concussion substitution but it was little surprise that the visitors lost their way after a bright start.When the half-time whistle sounded, it seemed to be a brief interlude in what would be a depressingly long night for Leeds.But Jimenez's exit provided the spark they needed to ignite an amazing comeback that sends them into the international break in very good spirits.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60702578
260,Everton 1-0 Newcastle United: Alex Iwobi's stoppage-time goal earns 10-man Toffees huge victory,THU 17 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Alex Iwobi's goal came in the 99th minute after a protestor tied himself to a goalpostAlex Iwobi's 99th-minute goal earned Everton a massive victory in their fight against relegation as they held on to beat Newcastle despite being reduced to 10 men. An average game, which was delayed by a protestor tying himself to a goalpost by his neck, came to life late on when Allan was sent off with seven minutes remaining for taking out Newcastle substitute Allan Saint-Maximin.Referee Craig Pawson consulted the pitchside monitor and overturned his initial decision to book the Everton midfielder.At that stage, and with 14 minutes of stoppage time to play because of the protest, hanging on for a draw looked like the best Frank Lampard's side could achieve. Yet in the ninth minute of additional time, substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin led a breakaway and slipped Iwobi through before he found the bottom corner. It led to wild celebrations at Goodison Park as Everton earned only their second win in 13 Premier League games to put three points between them and the relegation zone.But, as Lampard and his players hugged each other in delight at the final whistle, it felt like a victory worth much more than that as they consigned Newcastle to a second consecutive defeat.   'I will take it for the three points' - Lampard breaks hand celebrating Everton winnerEverton 1-0 Newcastle: Frank Lampard praises 'spirit' of players and fansEverton overturn poor form with galvanising win The last time these two teams played each other on 8 February, Newcastle were in the bottom three and four points behind Everton in Lampard's first league game in charge. But victory at St James' Park and a golden period for Eddie Howe's side has propelled them to a point where it is Everton who are threatened with the drop. This win, however, could act as a galvanising force for a team which has struggled for form and for most of this match showed themselves as a side bereft of confidence. The fact the hosts were able to overturn what looked like a harsh decision on Allan will be all the more pleasing for Lampard and his team as they celebrated wildly with their fans as Pawson blew for full-time.  It was a pulsating end to an otherwise average encounter where Everton supporters had been reduced to cheering tackles and interceptions.  By contrast, Newcastle, with Joelinton back in the side, were a well-drilled unit and Bruno Guimaraes, making only his third start since joining the club in January, made them tick at the base of the midfield.Everton 1-0 Newcastle: Boss Eddie Howe 'expected a lot more' from NewcastleThe visitors had the better of the first half as Chris Wood headed over and straight at Asmir Begovic, who started in goal in place of the ill Jordan Pickford. And while Ben Godfrey had an early header saved by Martin Dubravka, Everton, who were also without Donny van de Beek, struggled to find any rhythm. Their half was summed up when the effervescent Anthony Gordon missed a kick on the edge of the area. The second half took a bizarre twist when a protestor tied himself to a goalpost at the Gwladys Street End, which led to an eight-minute delay. The protestor was later arrested on suspicion of pitch encroachmentBut the break did not lead to an improvement as Demarai Gray shot wide and Guimaraes then mis-hit a shot which was saved before the game turned in Newcastle's favour with Allan was sent off just as his team were in the ascendancy. Gordon had tested Dubravka with a curling effort, with Seamus Coleman appealing for a penalty shortly afterwards. But as Newcastle broke away Allan took out Saint-Maximin, which led to a booking, which was soon overturned as Pawson was directed to the monitor by the video assistant referee Stuart Attwell. That led to a feeling of acrimony inside Goodison, in tune with Everton's recent form. The late reprieve and the host's ability to hold on as Newcastle pressed for an equaliser, turned the mood on its head, however. Lampard will hope it can now lead to his team's Premier League survival.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59764949
261,Brighton & Hove Albion 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Harry Kane scores as visitors reignite top-four hopes,WED 16 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Harry Kane scored his 178th Premier League goal at BrightonTottenham manager Antonio Conte says Harry Kane ""deserves to win something"" after the forward scored and starred in their Premier League win at Brighton. Kane's seventh goal in six games sealed a deserved success for Spurs, who reignited their top-four hopes by condemning Brighton to a sixth successive Premier League defeat. It also ensured the England forward has now scored more goals away from home (95) in the competition than any other player - and lifted him above Frank Lampard into fifth, with 178 goals, on the all-time list of Premier League scorers.""I am happy for him because in every game he has many chances to score,"" Conte said.""At the start of the season he struggled a bit and didn't score a lot and now he knows very well with this team he has great opportunities to score in every game.""To have a striker like him makes us stronger but at the same time his feeling now is positive because he knows he will have chances. I think he deserves to win something in his career because we are talking about a fantastic player.""The ease with which the Italian's side won will concern Seagulls manager Graham Potter, whose side remain 13th having won just once in their last 10 matches. By the time Kane had driven a low effort past Robert Sanchez, Tottenham were well in control. Cristian Romero had earlier put the visitors in front, deflecting in Dejan Kulusevski's shot past the helpless Brighton goalkeeper, and into the bottom left corner. The result sees Conte's side move up to seventh in the table with 48 points three points adrift of fourth-placed Arsenal having played a game more. However, they are only two points behind fifth-placed Manchester United, level on points with West Ham and have a game in hand on both before they host the Hammers on Sunday.Follow all Wednesday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Brighton & Hove Albion contentVisit our Tottenham pageBrighton 0-2 Tottenham: Conte sees 'positive things'Kane goes fifth in Premier League goals listIn the build-up to the game Conte had challenged his senior players to help deliver Champions League qualification and, in a show of faith, he named the same starting XI that began their defeat at Old Trafford.Kane did not disappoint, putting a glaring early miss behind him to ensure a favourable outcome for his side. Having charged down an attempted Sanchez clearance the 28-year-old could not contain his look of disappointment as he placed a side-footed effort wide of a vacant Brighton goal. However, it was not to last for long and his influence grew throughout the match.He repeatedly dropped into pockets of space in midfield, but also showed the nous to run beyond the Brighton backline as he raced onto Rodrigo Bentancur's pass to drive a low effort past Sanchez just before the hour.His goal leaves him in distinguished company with only Alan Shearer (260), Wayne Rooney (208), Andrew Cole (187) and Sergio Aguero (184) having scored more Premier League goals.A Sanchez save prevented him from curling his second of the night into the top corner, while he also had a late penalty claim turned down.Brighton & Hove Albion 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Graham Potter 'proud' after 'tough' eveningBrighton's dismal run continuesWhile Tottenham give the appearance of a side getting close to fulfilling their manager's expectations, Brighton look shorn of confidence after a dismal run of form.The Seagulls have now lost six consecutive league games for the first time since 2006, when they were in the Championship, and will come up against a Norwich side fighting for top-flight survival on Saturday 2 April in their first match after the international break. That is followed by tough assignments at Arsenal, Spurs and Manchester City and they have the feel of a team wondering where their next points are coming from. While they improved significantly after the break they rarely looked like cutting open the Spurs defence and unsurprisingly failed to register a single effort on target.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59536759
262,Arsenal 0-2 Liverpool: Visitors close in on leaders Manchester City with deserved victory,WED 16 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Firmino scored six minutes after coming on in the second half to double Liverpool's lead at Emirates StadiumLiverpool moved to within one point of Premier League leaders Manchester City as they emerged impressive winners after a tough examination at Arsenal. The Gunners, well in the fight to finish in the top four, pushed Liverpool hard until Jurgen Klopp's quadruple-chasing side ruthlessly took control after the break. Liverpool keeper Alisson saved crucially from Martin Odegaard after Thiago's misplaced backpass before Diogo Jota put Liverpool ahead, beating Aaron Ramsdale at his near post in the 54th minute. Jota and Luis Diaz were immediately replaced by Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, the latter doubling Liverpool's advantage just after the hour mark with a perfect flick from Andrew Robertson's cross. Liverpool have now reeled off nine Premier League wins in succession while Arsenal remain in fourth, a point ahead of Manchester United but with two games in hand. Reaction to Wednesday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best Arsenal contentVisit our Liverpool pageLiverpool move through the gearsArsenal 0-2 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp excited for title fight with Man CityOnce Jota made the breakthrough for the visitors there was no way back for the Gunners, but before then the Reds were indebted to Alisson's significant contribution when he made that block from Odegaard. To that point Arsenal were in confident mood, playing fearlessly, but they were again undone by Jota - the scourge of Mikel Arteta's team in the Carabao Cup semi-final in January - although the Portuguese was helped by Ramsdale's weak effort to save his near-post shot. Klopp's Midas touch worked again when he removed Jota and substitute Firmino showed his silky touch to slide a near-post flick past Ramsdale. Arsenal were deflated and Liverpool moved even closer to Manchester City, who were held to a draw here in the capital by Crystal Palace on Monday. The advantage still lies with Pep Guardiola's reigning champions - but the margin is slender and this was another potentially difficult hurdle overcome by Liverpool. Arsenal fall short againArsenal 0-2 Liverpool: Actions in the box lost us the game - Mikel ArtetaArsenal's players were applauded off by the home fans at the final whistle in recognition of their efforts, especially the outstanding Gabriel Martinelli, who gave Trent Alexander-Arnold a torrid time. And they remain in prime position to achieve their remaining goal this season, a place in the top four, but they are still finding it tough to overcome the sides they will eventually want to rival. Liverpool have now completed the league double over Arsenal, as have Manchester City, while they have also lost at home to Chelsea and away to Manchester United. The Gunners were in contention for a long time, led by the verve of Martinelli, but ultimately it was Liverpool who had the cutting edge and greater quality. There is no doubt Arteta's Arsenal are on an upward curve and this was a far more convincing performance than that League Cup loss, but they still have a long road to travel before the old glories can be contemplated once more. 'We lost the game in the boxes'Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta to BBC MOTD: ""From box to box, we did everything that we'd planned. What happened in the boxes was a different story, that's where we lost the game.""I think the whole team played fantastically well. I don't think the result reflects the performance, but in the box they had the decisive moments. They put the ball in the net twice.""Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp to BBC MOTD: ""Coming here and winning against Arsenal is already special, but winning the game like it was - more special. We started really well then it became an open game. We wanted to improve in the second half. ""I'm very excited about the team and the situation we are in but that does not change everything. We just need to keep going. We really want to enjoy the situation we are in by winning football matches.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60671958

264,Chelsea 1-0 Newcastle United: Kai Havertz's late goal gives hosts three points,SUN 13 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Kai Havertz has scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time, and in all competitions he has had a hand in six goals in his last five games (five goals, one assist)Chelsea snatched a dramatic winner against Newcastle in the first game at Stamford Bridge since Blues' Russian owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government.The game looked to be heading towards a goalless draw before Kai Havertz expertly controlled a ball forward and fired into the net in the 88th minute.It was a tough goal to concede for Newcastle who had wanted Havertz to be sent off in the first half for catching Dan Burn in the face with an elbow when jumping, but the German only received a booking.Before the goal, both sides had struggled to create clear-cut chances, with Chelsea taking 75 minutes to produce an effort on target.Newcastle's Miguel Almiron had earlier forced a fine save from home goalkeeper Edouard Mendy with a well-struck 25-yard volley and Burn headed just wide.Just as had happened in Chelsea's 3-1 away win over Norwich on Thursday, a small section of fans chanted Abramovich's name, for a brief period in the second half.Abramovich has been sanctioned as a part of the government's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, meaning his assets, including Chelsea Football Club, have been frozen.Prospective owner Candy wants fan on club board if Chelsea takeover successfulChelsea v Newcastle as it happened, plus reaction and analysisA good end to a tough week for Chelsea and TuchelChelsea 1-0 Newcastle: Thomas Tuchel praises Kai Havertz's 'rare quality'Chelsea stay third, but are now only seven points behind second-placed Liverpool and 10 adrift of leaders Manchester City. Meanwhile, Newcastle, beaten for the first time in nine Premier League matches, are 14th, 10 points clear of the relegation zone.The relief and delight shown from Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, both at the goal and again at the final whistle, showed what this meant to him by screaming at the fans and punching the air.And it was easy to see why he was so emotional with the club's very existence potentially under threat.Abramovich has been the Chelsea owner for nearly 19 years, a period in which they have won 21 trophies, including the Premier League on five occasions and the Champions League twice.But the current sanctions against him have stopped him selling Chelsea, and mean the club are unable to buy or sell players, cannot sell any more tickets for games, have had their credit cards suspended and have had to close the club shop.The government said it would issue a special licence that allowed fixtures to be fulfilled, staff to be paid and existing ticket holders to attend matches, although the club's wage bill stands at £28m a month.It seemed fitting that Newcastle, another side with hugely controversial owners following their takeover in October by the Saudi Arabian-backed Public Investment Fund (PIF), were Chelsea's opponents on a day when events off the field were talked about as much as those on it.Newcastle's takeover and the potential huge investment into the club was celebrated by their fans a few months ago, although Amnesty International said ""it represented a clear attempt by the Saudi authorities to sportswash their appalling human rights record with the glamour of top-flight football"".Plenty of positives for NewcastleChelsea 1-0 Newcastle: Eddie Howe 'disappointed' to lose unbeaten runDespite the late defeat, this was another sign of the progress Newcastle are making on the pitch. There was plenty for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe to be positive about given his side were only a few minutes away from securing a point away at the current European and world champions.Arriving at a club without a league win and with only six points from 12 matches, he began with five defeats in his first eight games in all competitions, including a humiliating home loss to third-tier Cambridge United in the FA Cup third round.But, after spending £80m in the January transfer window, the Magpies had been on a run of eight games unbeaten, including six victories, before this narrow loss.The visitors had defended superbly up until Jorginho's excellent ball over the defence found Havertz, who showed his class to control it and then score the winner to delight the packed crowd at Stamford Bridge.Howe said he thought Havertz could have been sent off but was also disappointed his side did not get a second-half penalty when Trevoh Chalobah had a hold of Jacob Murphy's shirt.Newcastle wanted Chelsea's Kai Havertz to be sent off for elbowing Dan Burn, but Havertz only received a yellow card after a check by the video assistant referee",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60635693

And defeat by Wolves was their seventh at home in the league this season. Everton had won three of Lampard's first four home matches as Everton boss - but two of those wins had come in the FA Cup. The Toffees have picked up only three league points under their new boss, and only bottom club Norwich, with one, have collected fewer over the same period.Some Everton fans had seen enough after Kenny's red card and began to filter out, but those who stuck around made their feelings clear at the full-time whistle as boos rang around Goodison Park.In fairness, they had little to cheer about, and with Dominic Calvert-Lewin missing through illness, the spotlight fell on Richarlison as Everton's lone striker. The Brazilian looked sharp from the first whistle and had a couple of early chances, but couldn't find a way past goalkeeper Jose Sa.Everton's early momentum was checked by an incident in which Wolves' South Korean forward Hwang Hee-chan, injured after a challenge by Donny van de Beek, went down three times, stopping the game to get treatment, before eventually being replaced by Daniel Podence on 15 minutes.The delay caused by Hwang's injury riled the home fans, but the first half lacked any real quality and was crying out for a moment of magic before the break. Raul Jimenez obliged, but sent his overhead kick flying high over Jordan Pickford's bar.In contrast to Everton's away form, Wolves have the Premier League's fourth best record on the road this season, behind only Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea.They dominated after the break and it was Coady who found found the far corner with a powerful header from Neves' cross to take his goal tally to three for the season.As Everton look down the table, Wolves are still pushing for a place in Europe after their eighth away win - their best tally in a Premier League season.Everton 0-1 Wolves: Bruno Lage pleased with adaptability in win at Everton",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60635691
266,Leeds 2-1 Norwich: Joe Gelhardt strike gives manager Jesse Marsch first win in thrilling finish,SUN 13 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Gelhardt had been on the field for less than two minutes when he scored in injury timeLeeds landed a first victory under manager Jesse Marsch in stunning fashion as Joe Gelhardt struck in injury time to beat relegation rivals Norwich and send Elland Road into raptures.The 19-year-old substitute - on the pitch for less than two minutes - turned into an empty net from Raphinha's assist, serving a brutal blow to Norwich after they had finally levelled through Kenny McLean at the start of injury time.The thrilling finale served up scenes of contrast as Leeds' fans jubilantly sang along to Kaiser Chiefs' 'I predict a riot' while Norwich players sat dejected on the turf.Rodrigo's first-half goal had looked set be enough to see Leeds end a run of six games without a win but on a day where Raphinha twice struck the bar and where the impressive Daniel James went close, they almost paid for not taking their chances.Norwich may point to Patrick Bamford appearing to be offside in the build-up to Rodrigo's opener and they also saw a penalty award overturned shortly before they equalised when referee Stuart Attwell visited the pitch-side monitor.Ultimately they found a way to level, stunning the Leeds support, but Gelhardt's contribution moves Marsch's side four points above the relegation zone while Norwich stay bottom - five points from safety.Marsch summed the finish up as ""very frantic"", adding: ""I'd heard a lot about the magic of Elland Road and we felt that today.""Mayhem, joy and dejectionLeeds 2-1 Norwich: Marsch says points are big but the moment is even biggerGelhardt said his decisive goal delivered an ""unbelievable feeling"", while team-mate Stuart Dallas said ""this is why you play football, for moments like this"". Dean Smith's Norwich players wore a look of how key this remarkable finish may prove to their survival hopes.Norwich's hopes of survival have been hindered greatly by what is now a six-game losing run, but none of them are likely to sting as much as this.In the final moments Smith sent goalkeeper Tim Krul forward for a corner in search of another equaliser and striker Teemu Pukki forced a vital save from Illan Meslier in the kind of frenetic ending that pointed to what was at stake.Marsch deserves credit for his role in the late mayhem as he moved to introduce Gelhardt for Mateusz Klich at a point where the life had been sucked out of the stadium.When Raphinha rounded Krul the Brazilian was able to give Gelhardt a simple task to lift the gloom that had set in after a 3-0 midweek defeat to Aston Villa.Against Villa, Leeds suffered the blow of losing four top-flight games in a row without scoring for the first time since March 1982.It prompted Marsch to state ""this is a business for men"" and that the way out of relegation trouble would be paved with ""courage and belief"".They showed plenty early on as Rodrigo drilled home via a deflection, Raphinha volleyed against the bar and Pascal Struijk turned over from close range after seeing an initial header saved.Leeds 2-1 Norwich: Smith says his side can't keep giving halves of football awayRodrigo's goal did not come without controversy as a long ball in the build-up was pursued by Bamford, who appeared offside.The striker - making his first start since September - was chasing the ball but did not make a challenge, as a poor headed clearance allowed the energetic James to tee up Rodrigo.James whipped an effort at goal after the break to prompt a superb save and Raphinha's sublime free-kick hit the bar before Norwich started their late push. Milot Rashica went down in the box under the challenge of Luke Ayling but the penalty awarded was overturned when replays showed the Norwich player had stood on Ayling's leg. To their credit, Norwich refused to let the blow slow their momentum and their leveller was beautifully worked, with Pukki getting on the end of a fine long diagonal pass to fire a cross into the six-yard box for McLean to turn home.A draw might have been harsh on Leeds, who showed more energy than their visitors in the final third and ultimately created the better chances.Norwich are now increasingly staring at the prospect of relegation.Smith put three games without defeat together when he was appointed in November and another three-game run of form helped their cause in January. They will need to show character and find more than a pocket of good form after this harsh ending.Leeds, by contrast, will surely be filled with survival optimism.Go straight to all the best Leeds United contentVisit our Norwich City page",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60635699

""It is so difficult for me right now in this moment thinking about football because every day, the Russian army is killing Ukrainian people.""I just want to say thank you to my team-mates, who support me all the time, every day. To West Ham fans, they also support me and Ukrainian people and also to all British people, because we feel you support us. ""I felt the support from the fans and I tried to give everything on the pitch because I know how important the game was for us today. I'm not ready for 100% because the last two weeks I train maybe three or four times.""Since 26 February, I had to rest for four days because it was impossible to train; I was just thinking about my family and my people. I just tried to give everything on the pitch.""Following the game, Hammers boss David Moyes told the BBC the club had given the striker ""as much time as he needs"".""His family are safe at the moment, he tells me,"" said Moyes. ""He wants to make sure everybody is fine and he has a lot going on. ""Sometimes, football is a release and hopefully he has had a bit of a release getting on the pitch again and scoring but there are more important things in life than football.""The goal is great. He has great technical ability and he is capable of scoring big goals, as he has done for me since I've been here.""There are more important things in life than football - David MoyesThe Hammers were lifted after taking the lead and Pablo Fornals sealed victory when he powered Benrahma's cutback past Martinez.Villa arrived in the capital off the back of three impressive wins but they had to settle for a Jacob Ramsey consolation late on.The visitors were denied taking the lead when Danny Ings' effort was tipped onto the post by Lukasz Fabianski before the ball came harmlessly back to the West Ham goalkeeper.Victory for the hosts ended a run of three defeats in all competitions and lifted them to fifth in the table, while Villa remain ninth.Yarmolenko makes the difference In a first half with few clear cut chances, Yarmolenko's introduction in the 51st minute sparked the crowd and the game into life.The Ukraine forward, who featured on the front cover of the match programme, replaced Antonio to a warm ovation and immediately set about linking up his side's play.Then the moment of brilliance came when he neatly brought down Benrahma's tricky pass before guiding the ball into the far corner in two movements.Football will have been secondary for Yarmolenko since Russia's invasion of his country and, in that small moment of adulation, he allowed the emotion to spill out.Having been boosted by the goal, the forward then opted to take on another shot from a tight angle rather than look for the pass, but no-one in the London Stadium was complaining at his choice.Key moments went against us - GerrardFornals fired the second which put the game out of reach but Villa rallied late on as they tried to wrestle back momentum.Ramsey smashed Emiliano Buendia's pass into the net with aplomb after the latter had a good opportunity kept out by the impressive Fabianski.Steven Gerrard will be pleased by his side's intent after going behind as they managed more shots on target (seven) than their hosts (four), but they lacked the clinical edge that has seen them score nine unanswered goals in their last three matches.

He said: ""We have to be there; we should be there. Our history obliges to be there but we are not there yet and there are still a lot of games to play.""We have an excellent group of people at the club who believe in what we do. Then you have to put performance into results. The last few months, we have been more consistent.""Partey headed in unchallenged from Gabriel Martinelli's corner after 11 minutes as the hosts capitalised on their dominant start.The midfielder also struck the crossbar as Arsenal pressed for a second, while goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale was twice called upon to deny Harvey Barnes - including a superb reaction save from a header - as the visitors threatened before half-time.But, after Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu was penalised for handball following a lengthy video assistant referee review, Lacazette fired in a 59th-minute penalty to put the Gunners in control.Soyuncu received only a yellow card as Partey's still goal-bound header was cleared off the line by the alert Luke Thomas.However, there was to be no way back for Brendan Rodgers's side, who remain 12th in the table.Reaction to Sunday's Premier League gamesGo straight to all the best Arsenal contentVisit our Leicester City pageArsenal on course to end Champions League waitArsenal 2-0 Leicester City: Arteta praises ""outstanding performances"" as Gunners reclaim top-four spotSeeking to end a five-year absence from Europe's elite club competition, Arsenal ensured they remain in pole position in the race to qualify with a ninth win in 11 league games.With three games in hand over fifth-placed United from which to further strengthen their position, Arteta's men - unlike their immediate rivals - have achieved consistency in both performances and results to emerge as favourites for fourth.The opening goal was a familiar tale for Leicester, who have now conceded a league-high 15 goals from set-pieces - excluding penalties - after Partey's run to the near post went ignored.Arsenal had amassed six shots before Leicester, sorely missing injured talisman Jamie Vardy, managed their first attempt after 24 minutes.But, just as he was in October's reverse fixture, which Arsenal also won 2-0, the inspired Ramsdale was up to the task when the Foxes eventually gained a foothold in the contest.Martinelli and Bukayo Saka impressed in attack for Arsenal, while Partey was influential in midfield, but it was the slick Martin Odegaard who stood out as he created five big chances for his team-mates in the first half alone.Lacazette's confidently converted spot-kick ultimately moved the game beyond Leicester, after referee Anthony Taylor also took his time to review Soyuncu's subtle handball on the pitch-side monitor.""We have seen so many decisions with VAR and things that have gone against us this season in similar situations,"" said Rodgers. ""Cags is reacting, he is moving his body, he can't move his body like a mannequin and have his arms straight down. Hugely disappointing.""Rodgers' side must quickly dust themselves down as focus switches to securing a place in the last eight of the Europa Conference League, as they take a 2-0 lead into their second leg against Rennes on Thursday.For Arsenal, a meeting with title-chasing Liverpool on Wednesday will provide an acid test of their progress since a 4-0 loss at Anfield earlier this season.Rodgers says he does not know what Soyuncu can do to avoid penalty",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60635697

Sean Dyche's side either need to win more games in the last 11 matches of the season than the first 27 - or else hope Leeds and Everton, who have both changed managers recently, keep losing.They created nowhere near enough chances to win, with Cornet's tame finish and Rodriguez's thunderous strike the only moments resembling chances.To make matters worse, Collins' late red card for denying Toney a clear goalscoring opportunity reduces their options at the back with captain Ben Mee still injured.Meanwhile, Toney is singlehandedly dragging Brentford to safety - with five goals in the past eight days against teams in the relegation zone. His hat-trick took care of Norwich in a 3-1 win last weekend and he now has eight goals in his past six games. Thomas Frank's side move on to 30 points and this season teams are unlikely to need to reach the 38-point mark to stay up.They were far from spectacular but they did have other chances.Eriksen, making his first home start, had a 20-yard deflected shot saved by Nick Pope and Vitaly Janelt headed over the bar.Brentford 2-0 Burnley: Thomas Frank praises Christian Eriksen after 'unbelievable' assist",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60628392
272,Manchester United 3-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Cristiano Ronaldo scores hat-trick in thriller,SAT 12 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Cristiano Ronaldo quadrupled his goal tally for 2022Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first Manchester United hat-trick in 14 years as Tottenham were defeated in a thrilling encounter at Old Trafford.The brilliant Portuguese put United ahead twice before heading home the winner from Alex Telles' corner nine minutes from time, the 807th goal of his career.Tottenham twice responded to Ronaldo's efforts, through a Harry Kane penalty and a Harry Maguire own goal. But it was Ronaldo who had the final word, completing his first United treble since January 2008, in a 6-0 win over Newcastle.The result was a major confidence boost for United before Tuesday's Champions League last-16 second leg against Atletico Madrid. It also moves them back into the top four and keeps Tottenham in seventh, although Arsenal - two points behind in fifth - remain favourites to clinch the final Champions League berth as they have four games in hand.There were reports that Ronaldo is now the Fifa-recognised all-time top goalscorer, surpassing Josef Bican's 805 goals but there are doubts about the Czech-Austrian's figure - which includes reserve games. 'A staggering performance' - Shearer on Ronaldo's response to his criticsGo straight to all the best Manchester United contentVisit our Tottenham pageMan Utd 3-2 Spurs: Ronaldo is never a problem - PogbaThe Ronaldo showThe debate around Ronaldo's value to this United team has been going on from the moment their season started to unravel barely a couple of weeks after his much-heralded return.At 37, it is clear his best days are behind him.Yet he remains capable of such moments of brilliance that it is hard to see how this present squad would benefit from him not being there.His opener was a prime example.Fred's deft flick to the side helped considerably but Ronaldo's two precise touches teed up the right-footed shot that flew over Hugo Lloris and into the top corner.The second was further evidence of Ronaldo's ability to exploit weakness. He timed his run to perfection as Jadon Sancho made the most of Sergio Reguilon's struggles within the Tottenham defensive line to deliver the low cross that his vastly experienced team-mate turned home with ease.And if anyone was likely to get a winner, it was United's number seven.When he did, Ronaldo was immediately replaced to a standing ovation that was totally deserved.LWLWLWL - Tottenham's consistent inconsistencyTottenham's season was summed up by Antonio Conte's reaction to what he thought was a first-half equaliser from Ben Davies.As the ball hit the net, there was wild celebration. Then the assistant's flag went up and Conte was stopped in his tracks.Tottenham's past seven results have alternated between wins and defeats - with three victories punctuating four losses. And their tendency to wobble let them down again here. Having gone behind, they worked their way back into the game once - and there was never much doubt Kane would drive home the spot-kick after Telles had handled in the area. But the manner in which they went 2-1 down three minutes later highlighted obvious deficiencies, with Reguilon switching off on the far side of the pitch.Tottenham then got back into the game a second time, and deserved to, even if Maguire scored for them.But such is Spurs' inconsistency, few would believe they can genuinely overhaul Arsenal to seal a top four berth even if, mathematically, they still have a better chance of doing so than United.Ronaldo hat-trick 'his best performance' - Rangnick",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60628394

He is going to be a huge player for us.""Saints had taken a deserved 25th-minute lead when Stuart Armstrong nodded home Mohamed Elyounoussi's knock-back via a deflection off Dan Burn.But Newcastle, who were without Allan Saint-Maximin and Joelinton on the south coast, equalised seven minutes later courtesy of Chris Wood's first goal for the club, the New Zealand striker powering Jonjo Shelvey's inswinging cross past the stranded Fraser Forster.Che Adams rattled the crossbar with a thunderous first-half volley and Martin Dubravka was the busier of the two goalkeepers late on, but Guimaraes' superb strike from Burn's cushioned header ultimately proved decisive.""I thought it was 'welcome to the Premier League' for Bruno - an end-to-end game, high in transitions and very physical,"" added Howe. ""It will be a really good experience for him.""He's a defensive midfielder, but a creative one. The reason we signed him was because we loved his way of playing, his eye for a pass and composure.""Newcastle were three points from safety following a 4-0 home defeat to Manchester City in December, but are now in 14th place and 10 clear of third-bottom Burnley.

A Tino Livramento cross-shot almost caught out the Magpies goalkeeper as the game entered the final quarter of an hour, but the Slovakia international was able to prevent the ball from dipping underneath the crossbar.Dubravka was called into action again from the resulting corner, denying fit-again Mohammed Salisu with a smart intervention, before producing arguably his best save of the match to stop another Salisu header from creeping in at the far post.Armstrong also had a dipping effort tipped over by Dubravka deep into stoppage time as Newcastle held out to take another huge step towards safety.Southampton 1-2 Newcastle: Hasenhuttl frustrated by missed chances",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59792555
275,Wolverhampton Wanderers 4-0 Watford: Early goals heap misery on Roy Hodgson's side,THU 10 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Wolves striker Raul Jimenez scored his sixth goal of the season and first in five matchesRoy Hodgson said his Watford team were ""running out of time"" to preserve their Premier League status after being thrashed at Wolves. The hosts scored three times in the opening 21 minutes as they recorded their biggest top-flight win since 2011 to keep Watford in the relegation zone, three points from safety.Watford, who have won just one of their last 16 league games, missed the opportunity to move level on points with fourth-bottom Everton and, worryingly for them, they have also played more matches than the sides immediately above them and have a worse goal difference.""It was disappointing in every respect,"" Hodgson said.""We have a very sad dressing room. That is what we sign up for. It gets hard when your players don't care enough, but we are not in that position yet. We have to hold our hands up that we are not good enough at times, but not that they don't care.""All the goals are mistakes, some are clearer mistakes than others. These players need to feel anxiety because we are running out of time.""A catastrophic start saw Raul Jimenez turn home a 13th-minute opener from Hwang Hee-chan's short pass before a Cucho Hernandez own goal and a first-time Daniel Podence effort.Ruben Neves rounded off the scoring with a magnificent chip five minutes from time as Wolves equalled their biggest Premier League win, matching their thrashing of Blackpool 11 years ago.Watford have now taken five points from eight games under Hodgson and spent most of the second period on a damage-limitation exercise, failing to manage a single shot on target for the first time in 32 league games. Wolves meanwhile can reflect on having scored three times in the first-half of Premier League game at Molineux for the first time since the April 2019 win against Arsenal.

Lage will have been equally delighted with how Neves wrapped up the win late on, chipping Foster from just inside the box having spotted the keeper off his line.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59403638

Leeds' 15th league defeat of the season leaves them 16th in the table Marsch said he was ""surprised"" by his side's ""disjointed"" display. He said: ""I heard a lot about Elland Road and the energy, and it was fantastic. I think we have a group that wants to perform for the fans so hard that they are almost in some ways chained by the pressure and aren't able to be clear and play with more confidence.""We addressed that at half-time and our best spell was the 15 minutes after the break.

""The key is to go step by step, stay calm and stay focused and disciplined for how we want to play and what we want to be.""I'm trying to impart that on the players and it's not for lack of desire or work ethic, it's actually because of that, so I have to try to find a way to keep the group calm and create clarity for what we need on the pitch.""Villa a 'joy to watch' - GerrardLeeds 0-3 Aston Villa: Philippe Coutinho is in 'magical form' - Steven GerrardWhile defeat leaves Leeds looking nervously over their shoulders, Steven Gerrard's Villa are up to ninth after a third consecutive win and clean sheet.

277,Tottenham 5-0 Everton: Harry Kane becomes sixth highest goalscorer in Premier League history,MON 07 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Harry Kane's 176 Premier League goals for Tottenham have come in 270 appearancesTottenham increased Everton's growing relegation fears and maintained their own top-four aspirations as Frank Lampard's side were outclassed and humiliated. On an embarrassing night for Lampard and his players, Spurs ran riot as Everton capitulated in a fashion that raises genuine doubts about their ability to maintain Premier League status. Everton defender Michael Keane set the tone for the night by firing Ryan Sessegnon's into his own net after 14 minutes while goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was at fault for Son Heung-min's second three minutes later. Matt Doherty set Harry Kane free to put the game out of sight eight minutes before half-time, while any slim hopes of an Everton revival were snuffed out when substitute Sergio Reguilon scored with his first touch at the far post seconds after the restart. As Everton simply fell apart, Kane added the fifth after 55 minutes, meeting Doherty's perfect cross with a crisp left-footed volley. Everton are just one point and one place above the relegation zone with a game in hand on Burnley below them.Tottenham stay seventh, just three points behind fourth-placed Arsenal in the last of the Champions League qualifying spots.Tottenham v Everton as it happened, plus reaction and analysisVisit our Everton pageGo straight to all the best Tottenham contentLast month, following a 2-0 loss against Wolves, Spurs boss Antonio Conte insisted it was ""impossible"" for his side to finish in the top four but after Monday's win said his ""expectations have become higher"".""A top-four race for sure and we want to be involved - we're becoming stronger in many aspects,"" added the Italian.""We have to take the responsibility now. We have to fight to reach the best possible position and to fight for a place in the Champions League.""For sure it won't be easy. We need to have ambition and I think we can do this, I think we're ready to do this.""Since my arrival in Tottenham I didn't know if it could be realistic but now after months of hard work I think the two [new] players [Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur] complete our squad.""Spurs will fight for best possible position - ConteEverton in serious dangerEverton were last relegated from the top flight in 1951 and have had two last-day escapes in 1993-94 and 1997-98, but after this they should brace themselves for another cliffhanger this season. Years of mismanagement on and off the field have led to the acquisition of a mix-and-match bunch of individuals who appear to have neither the heart nor stomach for a fight, especially away from home. As so often this season, Everton collapsed at the first sign of adversity and once Keane, who is having a nightmare campaign, hammered emphatically into his own net early on, this was only going one way. What will concern Lampard most - and it should be remembered he inherited this mess rather than created it - was the heartless fashion in which Everton appeared to throw in the towel once Spurs hit them with two quick goals. It was an abysmal performance, with Everton's midfield non-existent and their defence horribly vulnerable, easy prey to the likes of Kane and Son. Given their abject form on their travels, Everton will now be reliant on home for to keep their heads above water, especially as two of those away games are trips to relegation rivals Watford and Burnley. They have two crucial home games coming up against Wolves and then fast-improving Newcastle United. Defeat in either is unthinkable but a genuine possibility such was the sheer incompetence on show here. Crucial mistakes cost Everton - LampardSpurs keep in contentionSpurs are the great unpredictable of the Premier League, with losses at Burnley and Middlesbrough in the FA Cup mixed in with a 4-0 win at Leeds United and this very convincing performance. Everton made it very easy for Conte's side but they took full advantage of those weaknesses to put themselves just three points behind north London rivals Arsenal, although they have played a game more. They will have few easier games than this but there is no doubt there is the talent in this side to challenge for the top four and a place in next season's Champions League if they can find a measure of consistency. Kane looks on top of his game and produced two comprehensive finishes, and with the England captain in this sort of form Spurs can always be a threat. Spurs were even able to ease up and conserve energy, such was their dominance over this awful Everton side. Kane goals were his 175th and 176th in the Premier League, taking him sixth in the competition's all-time list, above ex-Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and only one behind former Chelsea midfielder Lampard.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60551040

He has scored or assisted 13 Premier League goals this season, with only Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz (17) involved in more in Europe's top five leagues among players under the age of 21.Gunners boss Mikel Arteta had a big hand in the third goal, too, grabbing the ball after it went out of play and quickly passing it to Saka, who took the throw-in that led to the goal.Watford played their part in an engaging contest - Arsenal's Aaron Ramsdale was the much busier goalkeeper - but have won just once under Roy Hodgson.They become the fourth team to lose eight successive Premier League home matches, after Sunderland, Wolves and Norwich.Watford 2-3 Arsenal: Roy Hodgson says side can not play much better",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60531485
279,Manchester City 4-1 Manchester United: Kevin de Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez settle derby,SUN 06 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Manchester City outclassed Manchester United to maintain control of the Premier League title race with an outstanding display at Etihad Stadium. City remain six points clear of Liverpool having played one game more after a victory that was arguably even more convincing than the scoreline suggests. Ralf Rangnick's side were without injured Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani, as well as Raphael Varane and Luke Shaw, who have Covid-19, and found themselves overwhelmed by the quality and intensity of the reigning champions.  Kevin de Bruyne was at the heart of it all. He put City ahead with a crisp early finish then restored their lead before half-time after Jadon Sancho put United level with precise low strike, the Belgian's second hammered home in a goalmouth scramble. City turned up the tempo after the break and got the goal their vast superiority deserved after 68 minutes when Riyad Mahrez met De Bruyne's corner on the half-volley to beat United keeper David de Gea. The goal came via a deflection off United captain Harry Maguire, who endured a nightmare afternoon. It got even better for City in the closing moments when Mahrez raced clear to beat De Gea, the goal being given after a lengthy VAR check for offside. 'Either they're not good enough or they don't care' - pundits react to Man Utd's derby display'Man City prove a point to anyone who doubted them' - MOTD2 analysisReaction to Manchester City v Manchester United in the Premier LeagueFootball Daily podcast: Man City's derby stroll leaves Man Utd feeling blueVisit our Manchester City pageGo straight to all the best Manchester United contentMan City respond to pressureManchester City felt Liverpool at their back after Jurgen Klopp's side moved to within three points following their win against West Ham United but the champions could not have responded more impressively.  Kevin de Bruyne is the first player to be involved in three goals in the Manchester derby in the Premier League since Ashley Young in 2015From the first whistle, City imposed themselves on Manchester United and Sancho's fine equaliser proved to be only a minor inconvenience as the gap between Guardiola's team and their arch-rivals was brutally exposed. De Bruyne was the mastermind, scoring twice and creating City's third, the shining star in a galaxy on display at Etihad Stadium as they showed they are in no mood to relinquish their crown, no matter how hard Liverpool push them. City's first-half performance was excellent but after the break they were simply magnificent as they over-ran United, who were not given a second on the ball and were unable to resist wave after wave of attacks. Mahrez could have scored more than his two goals but for De Gea, while Joao Cancelo was also thwarted by the United keeper following an acrobatic volley. City's dominance of possession and ability to carve open an admittedly vulnerable United defence at will delighted their supporters, who revelled in a show of superiority that left United a beaten and bedraggled side long before the end. Maguire sums up Man Utd miseryThis was a miserable and chastening 90 minutes for Manchester United and few of their players suffered more than captain Maguire. Maguire was out of position for City's first, inexplicably let the ball go in a goalmouth scramble for De Bruyne's second and, unfortunately, deflected Mahrez's effort past De Gea for the third. He was also booked for a crude, desperate tackle on De Bruyne and looked a like a player whose confidence was non-existent. Rangnick was not helped by the injuries and illnesses that robbed him of key players but there was no excuse for the wastefulness in possession and the lack of defensive organisation, encapsulated by an amateurish S-shaped defensive ""line"" that saw Mahrez's final goal given after that VAR check. The loss puts United in a desperate position in the battle for crucial fourth place and a spot in next season's Champions League after Arsenal's win at Watford strengthened their hold on that position. The Gunners are now fourth, a point ahead of United with three games in hand. United, of course, are still in the Champions League but the notion that they have a chance of winning Europe's elite competition is the stuff of fantasy based on this grim evidence. It was painful to watch United chasing shadows and outmanoeuvred at every turn by a City team they would like to regard as rivals. United seem to be a club in limbo, with an interim manager in Rangnick and a squad of players who are not good enough and seem disaffected with life at the club. Bruno Fernandes, such an inspiration when he first arrived, now spends more time arguing with officials and attempting to buy cheap fouls than acting as a creative force while the momentum and joy sparked by the return of Ronaldo has long since gone. This was a dismal afternoon for United and they face an uphill fight to salvage their season. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60531492

His message will surely have been to focus on the multiple positives.No points, but plenty to take forward into a run of crucial games beginning with Aston Villa and Norwich at home next week.Leicester City 1-0 Leeds United: Performance more important than the points - Marsch",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60531436

The Brazilian, who joined Villa on loan from Barcelona in January, played a role in the first two goals, before scoring the third as Villa emphatically ended a four-game winless streak at Villa Park and produced their biggest win under Gerrard.After a smart Coutinho pass Danny Ings and Ollie Watkins linked up, the latter turning Jack Stephens before curling into the far corner for the opening goal after nine minutes. The second came on the stroke of half-time as Calum Chambers superbly lofted over the Saints defence with the outside of his boot for Coutinho to cushion across to compatriot Douglas Luiz who tapped home for his first league goal since January 2020.Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl brought on Yan Valery at half-time and switched to a back five, but Coutinho drilled home a third from the right side of the area, before Ings swept home a Matty Cash cutback against his former club in the opening 10 minutes of the half to end any hopes of a comeback. Football Daily: Brentford buzzing and Coutinho shines in Villa thrillerVilla frontmen ""unplayable"" in victory over Saints, says Gerrard""We've got Phil [Coutinho] back fit and in a really good physical place. He was right up there with his Liverpool form of old today and he was above the game at times,"" Gerrard, who played alongside the 29-year-old at Liverpool, told BBC Match of the Day.""I witnessed that at close quarters when I played with him. The goal he scored today, he was sending the defenders one way and the other, and he used to do that to me most days in training. ""He probably finished my career a couple of years early - he's the reason I've got screws in my knees and groin!"" The win sees Villa climb to 11th, just outside the top half on goal difference, while Southampton remain ninth.

A return of two goals and two assists in his opening 440 minutes was encouraging, but there was a sense that this was Coutinho properly reintroducing himself to English football.He linked up superbly with Watkins, who scored his seventh league goal of the season, both seeing golden opportunities set up by the other saved by Fraser Forster in the first half.Coutinho also latched on to a Watkins flick-on before slotting wide, but the partnership will give Gerrard food for thought after rumours emerged this weekexternal-link that he was willing to listen to offers for Watkins in the summer. Ralph Hasenhuttl says everything went wrong for his sideThe question remains whether Villa can keep hold of Coutinho in the summer, but based on the rapturous reception he got from the Villa Park faithful when he was substituted he may have found a place where he can start enjoying his football again. He offered Villa something that Southampton, who had only lost once in 10 games, lacked. They struggled to break down Villa and create clear-cut opportunities, with a Che Adams drive their only effort on target.The visitors' midfield trio of Oriol Romeu, Stuart Armstrong and James Ward-Prowse can lack a creative edge, meaning Saints become reliant on their full-backs and set pieces which Villa stifled throughout the game. Their recent run has drawn admirers, and this, while only likely to be a bump in the road, will concern Hasenhuttl with a top-half finish on offer and an FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester City in two weeks' time.

Ashley Westwood's looped cross was misjudged by Chelsea keeper Edouard Mendy, who only punched as far as Dwight McNeil. Somehow, with the goal gaping, he managed to shoot over the bar.Chelsea had plenty of possession in the first half, but little cutting edge; Nick Pope was barely tested in the Burnley goal.Almost immediately after the restart, though, James edged into a crowded area and kept his cool to fire emphatically across Pope.Chelsea were soon three up and in total control. First, Pulisic's pinpoint cross was guided home expertly by Havertz, before the German bundled James' cross over the line.Pulisic got in on the act 21 minutes from time, rounding off what turned out to be a comfortable afternoon for Chelsea.Chelsea put tough week behind themFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich has made it clear he is looking for offers for the club, but the travelling support gave him their backing by chanting his name throughout the afternoon.The Burnley fans responded with jeers on every occasion after both sides took part in a minute's applause in solidarity with Ukraine at kick-off.On the pitch Chelsea took their time asserting themselves but blew Burnley away from the moment the second half whistle blew.After starting - and scoring - in the FA Cup victory at Luton on Wednesday, Romelu Lukaku returned to the bench as Havertz took centre stage again.James' impact on the right could not be understated, given he helped open the game up with the first goal.Burnley struggling to pull away from troubleAfter back-to-back wins in February, the Clarets seemed to be stepping into gear at the right time in their survival bid,.However, having twice failed to climb out of the bottom three this week, questions will be asked.There were positive spells in the first half as they made life tough for Chelsea, but Aaron Lennon and McNeil failed to capitalise when it mattered.For all his impressive displays and plaudits since joining in January, Wout Weghorst has scored only one goal and he struggled to make an impact on Saturday.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60531450

It was a first Premier League victory for Eddie Howe's side against top-10 opposition this season and once again showed their improved resilience and grit under their new manager. After a bright start by the visitors, Ryan Fraser gave Newcastle the lead with his second goal of the season after Jacob Murphy's effort had bounced back off the post following a quick break.They doubled their lead when Fabian Schar headed in from Fraser's free-kick.Lewis Dunk clawed a goal back 10 minutes after the break when he lost Chris Wood from a corner to head in unmarked. That led to a nervy period for the hosts, as Dunk had another header saved by Martin Dubravka and Graham Potter's side bossed possession. Allan Saint-Maximin came off the bench following a calf injury to waste a good chance late on, but it did not prove costly with Brighton unable find an equaliser.

The first 10 minutes were a case in point. Potter's well-drilled side created space down the flanks but were thwarted by former Brighton defender Dan Burn, who had an excellent game. Pascal Gross, who threatened with set-pieces all afternoon, almost found Shane Duffy but the centre-back headed wide from five yards under pressure from Murphy. But after an encouraging start, the game switched Newcastle's way as Wood sold Duffy a dummy, sent Murphy away and Fraser tucked in the rebound. Schar's header then established a lead that looked comfortable, thanks to more smart defending from Burn and another impressive midfield display from Joelinton, whose limbs seemed to be everywhere.But the hosts' lacklustre start to the second half led to Dunk pulling a goal back when he lost Wood, who is still yet to score in seven games since his £25m move from Burnley. That led to a period where Newcastle lost control of the game. They were let off because Brighton failed to find the killer pass as the home fans began to show their nerves and frustration as the likes of Joe Willock gave the ball away. The Magpies have given away more points than any other Premier League team from winning positions, and it looked like they might concede an equaliser.

It was from an Eriksen corner that Brentford punished the hosts' first-half profligacy, with Kristoffer Ajer's near-post header falling to Toney.Toney's first spot-kick arrived after 52 minutes as referee Anthony Taylor reviewed a high foot by Ben Gibson on Pontus Jansson as the Norwich defender attempted to clear a cross.A second penalty in six minutes, awarded after Toney was felled by Gibson, allowed the 25-year-old to complete his treble. The damage had already been done when Milot Rashica had a response ruled out for offside midway through the second half, while Bryan Mbeumo was denied adding a fourth for Brentford for the same reason.Teemu Pukki gave the home fans something to cheer in added-time but an otherwise miserable day for Norwich left the Canaries five points from safety with 11 games remaining.Eriksen's 'extra magic' will help Brentford, says boss FrankFootball Daily: Brentford buzzing and Coutinho shines in Villa thrillerReaction to Norwich v Brentford, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League actionVisit our Norwich City pageGo straight to all the best Brentford contentEriksen inspires Brentford on full return 'It's not a new chapter, it's just my life continuing' - Eriksen glad to play 90 minutesSeven days on from his long-awaited return to action, Eriksen was called upon from the start in another crucial fixture in Brentford's bid to avoid an immediate return to the Championship.While Toney delivered the goals that secured a huge three points, the victory proved that the ability of former Tottenham player Eriksen to reignite Brentford's season will go a long way to determining the Bees' fate with 10 games remaining.The Dane's delivery to set up Toney's 32nd-minute opener displayed Eriksen's known quality from set-pieces, but in a contest with so much riding on it the midfielder offered a calming influence in possession.He had more touches (66), made more passes (44) and more passes in the final third (16) than any team-mate as he played the entirety of the 98-minute contest.Amid the pressures of the Premier League, there was time too for a touching moment. Eriksen, rightly, received a yellow card for bringing down Brandon Williams - but once the Norwich defender realised who had fouled him, he simply embraced his opponent.On Eriksen's performance, Brentford boss Frank said: ""You could see it was a top delivery for the first goal. There were top passes where he tried to find his team-mates in behind. You can also see there's more to come from him, which of course is a positive.""On hat-trick scorer Toney, Frank added: ""It is world-class. I have said this before but for me Ivan Toney is the best penalty taker in the world at this moment in time.""Frank buzzing with Brentford's 'mentality mindset and coolness'Norwich boss Dean Smith labelled the meeting with his former club as a ""must-not-lose"" encounter and this dismal home defeat means time is quickly running out for his side.Smith bemoaned the officiating at full-time but the fact is a fourth successive loss means the Canaries are five points adrift of 17th-placed Everton.They were unable to capitalise on a purposeful start when Rashica was denied at close range by David Raya, and Billy Gilmour shot over from the rebound inside the opening two minutes.Raya was again called upon to stop Pukki's low strike finding the bottom corner before half-time, but Norwich capitulated in the second half as Toney twice got the better of Tim Krul from the spot despite the goalkeeper's best efforts to put him off.Pukki eventually converted one of the home side's 15 attempts but it was a mere consolation for a side edging closer to relegation.""It was a bad day at the office for the officials unfortunately, and we've also made some bad decisions in our penalty box,"" said Smith.""I can understand the disappointment of the supporters. We felt Brentford was a club we could catch and we've had that taken away from us today. Big moments went against us.""Norwich boss Smith frustrated by VAR decisions in Brentford defeat",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60531464
285,Wolves 0-2 Crystal Palace: Jean-Philippe Mateta and Wilfried Zaha seal win for Eagles,SAT 05 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Crystal Palace have not lost away from home in the Premier League since 26 DecemberWolves' European hopes suffered a further blow as they slipped to a third successive Premier League defeat against an impressive Crystal Palace at Molineux.A dominant start by the visitors was rewarded when Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring from close range after fine build-up play by Conor Gallagher and Wilfried Zaha.Zaha then found the net himself from the penalty spot to double Palace's lead before half-time after Jeffrey Schlupp was tripped by Max Kilman.It could have been even better for the Eagles but for two fine saves from goalkeeper Jose Sa to deny Gallagher and Michael Olise.The home side offered little in response, with Vicente Guaita equal to efforts from Daniel Podence and Chiquinho.The win moves Patrick Vieira's side into the top half of the table on goal difference, while Wolves remain eighth.Eagles impress on the road againWolves 0-2 Crystal Palace: It was the perfect performancePalace boss Vieira had urged his side to maintain their focus on the Premier League despite securing a place in the last eight of the FA Cup in midweek, with the Eagles nine points clear of the bottom three going into the game.This win, and perhaps more significantly the manner of it, suggests they need not be concerned with matters at the foot of the table.This was a fine performance from the south London side, who dominated the opening 45 minutes. Mateta caused all sorts of problems through the middle, while Zaha, Schlupp and the lively Olise attacked down either flank.As good as they were as an attacking unit in the first half, they were equally impressive defensively after the break.Their effort and application was perhaps exemplified by Zaha, who chased all the way back into his own area to dispossess Ruben Neves just as the Wolves midfielder shaped to shoot.It was only Palace's third away Premier League win of the season but they are now unbeaten on the road since 26 December as their season looks to be gaining momentum.Wolves' season beginning to stallWolves 0-2 Crystal Palace: Bruno Lage says Wolves fans did not deserve this performanceWolves remain in the hunt for a European place but cannot have many complaints with defeat after another below-par display.Their progress this season has been based around defensive solidity rather than attacking prowess, with only Norwich scoring fewer than their 10 home league goals.However, the defence was far from secure in the first half as Palace launched wave after wave of attacks, much to the frustration of an increasingly edgy home crowd.Youngster Ki-Jana Hoever, once again deputising for the injured Nelson Semedo, struggled in particular as Palace repeatedly made inroads down the Wolves right before he was forced off with what looked like a hamstring problem.They improved after the break, particularly when Raul Jimenez was introduced, but were held at arm's length by a well-organised Palace side.Reaction to Wolves v Crystal Palace and the rest of Saturday's Premier League gamesVisit our Wolves pageGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60531471
286,Liverpool 1-0 West Ham United: Sadio Mane earns narrow win for Reds,SAT 05 Mar 2022,premier-league,"Sadio Mane has four goals in his last three Premier League appearancesSadio Mane's first-half goal was enough to give Liverpool victory over West Ham at Anfield and move them back within three points of Premier League leaders Manchester City.Jurgen Klopp's men deserved the win but it did not come without the odd scare as Pablo Fornals and Manuel Lanzini both wasted excellent chances to equalise.The Hammers' frustrations were compounded by the loss of in-form Jarrod Bowen to what looked like a significant injury, the forward helped off the pitch and down the tunnel following a collision with former Hull team-mate Andy Robertson.Five days before the Europa League last-16 first-leg trip to Sevilla, it was not what manager David Moyes needed.Liverpool had chances to extend their lead, with new signing Luis Diaz particularly impressive.However, with the title race as it is, victory was all that mattered. And now Liverpool fans are in the unusual position of hoping for a United victory in Sunday's Manchester derby at Etihad Stadium.""We could have done better. We did pretty well first half, but in the second half if you are not better, you need quick legs, big heart and passion and that's what we needed to get the result,"" Klopp told BBC Match of the Day.""In the end it was open, we needed a bit of luck, but you cannot win as many games in a row as we have without a bit of luck.""Reaction to Liverpool v West Ham and the rest of Saturday's Premier League gamesVisit our Liverpool pageGo straight to all the best West Ham contentDazzling DiazLife might have been far less stressful for Liverpool's fans had Mohamed Salah taken the first-minute chance that came his way, instead of firing straight at goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.At times, Liverpool's attack is so fast and fluid it is impossible for opposition defences to cope. And in Diaz, their £37.5m January arrival from Porto, they have a player that fits that template perfectly. The Colombian produced a wonderous piece of skill to create an early chance for himself which he drove into Craig Dawson's face.Diaz then came close twice in the second half too, with the first of those particularly impressive in the way he manipulated Mane's pass into a scoring chance that went narrowly wide. When he was replaced in the final minute of injury time, his standing ovation was fully deserved.""He is a top player - a most easy player to coach because all the things he is doing are pretty natural to him,"" added Klopp. ""There is not a lot of coaching necessary. Of course he needs to work on one or two things we do defensively, but he is very football smart, has a big heart and wants to fight extremely hard for the team.""In the end, though, Trent Alexander-Arnold's precise low cross created the one moment that mattered. The England man's 16th assist of a stellar season was one of his best, leaving Mane to turn home his fourth goal in five games from close range.Hammers worriesWest Ham have lost 70 league matches against Liverpool, have now won once at Anfield in 52 attempts, and Moyes is without a win in 66 away league games against Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United, so perhaps the outcome of the match was not a surprise.But the Scot will nevertheless wonder how his side failed to capitalise on some excellent chances.Arguably Fornals had the best when he was put through by Bowen just before the break, but instead of trying to beat Alisson in a conventional manner, he lofted a chip over the Brazilian that lacked pace and Alexander-Arnold was able to get back and clear.Lanzini then undid all his good work in creating space on the edge of the area by blazing over with only Alisson to beat, while in the final stages Michail Antonio was bearing down on goal only for Naby Keita to get back to deny him.""The players played really well today, I don't think a draw would have been off the mark but we didn't get it,"" Moyes told Match of the Day.""We needed one to go in. We had to ride our luck at the start but we grew into the game and had three big chances, plus one or two other opportunities on top of that.""Those frustrations were only compounded by the loss of Bowen, who was heavily tipped to make Gareth Southgate's England squad for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast.Moyes, clearly, will be more concerned about that trip to Sevilla and in addition to sweating on Bowen's fitness, must hope skipper Declan Rice has recovered from the illness that kept him out of this game in time to be available.""I think Jarrod will have a scan on his heel area. He has been playing really well for us so it would be a blow if we go into the Sevilla game without him,"" added the Scot.""Declan had illness that came on on Thursday and through Friday. We are hoping it will not be too bad but I can't tell at the minute.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60531478

""James scored a brilliant goal and then you could see the confidence from it. Then Vardy was there and did what Vardy does best.""He is a real catalyst for the team. You see his energy. He makes runs and presses and is normally in the right areas to score. He is a huge boost for us. To have that quality and mentality back in the team will help us.""We have to stay focused on the football and not look too far ahead. Stay calm, play our football and keep focused and then we came here and got a result.""A long way to go in the season. We want to go far as we can in the European competition and see where we are at the end of the season.""Jamie Vardy scored his first Premier League goal since netting twice in a 4-2 win over Watford on 28 November last yearVardy has been absent with a hamstring injury since the 1-0 win at Liverpool - the last time the Foxes had won before the trip to Turf Moor.""It has been a long nine weeks resting and then four weeks getting the muscles back up,"" Vardy told BBC Sport. ""The main thing was to get back on and put a performance in.""You always want to come on but you always have to listen to the medical team as well and I've been back in training just the last four days. Getting 20 minutes it is good for myself there is no more issues.""I don't think you can lose that [scoring touch]. It is instinct.""It had been a largely even game before Maddison's opener, although the Foxes did fashion the greater number of chances, finding home keeper Nick Pope in fine form.The Clarets had the ball in the net in the first half, but Maxwel Cornet was adjudged to have moved a fraction early to tap in Aaron Lennon's low cross.The win takes the Foxes to 30 points and allows them to breathe more easily after a poor recent run of league results.There is no respite for Sean Dyche's side, who have seen their recent crucial revival checked and stay in the bottom three, a point behind 17th-placed Everton.Follow live text commentary of Burnley v Leicester in the Premier LeagueVisit our Burnley pageGo straight to our best Leicester City contentCity show grit and Vardy brings the guileAfter two fifth-place finishes for Leicester in the past two seasons, this league campaign is now one of earning Premier League respectability while continuing to challenge for the last remaining piece of silverware on offer - the inaugural Europa Conference League.There have been extenuating circumstances for the Foxes' downturn this season, not least Vardy's extended absence, but they have looked a soft touch at times at the back, with the gradual sapping of confidence taking away their attacking verve.Prior to this game, they were the only side without an away clean sheet in the top flight this season, shipping 25 goals in 11 games on the road as part of a run of 18 top-flight matches away from the King Power Stadium without stopping the opposition scoring.They had also conceded a league-high 18 times from set-pieces.This result - and the performance to earn it - was crucial then, coming against a side with two wins and a draw from the past three matches, scrapping for every point and providing of the sternest of tests to a defence from corners and free-kicks.As pleasing for Brendan Rodgers as the two goals - both superbly taken by two substitutes providing that requisite touch of class from the bench - will be the way his side kept the Clarets contained.Aside from Cornet's disallowed tap-in, the home side were kept to half-chances, with the Ivorian poking another effort wide in the second-half and Wout Weghorst failing to convert at the back post shortly after Leicester's opener.Better chances came at the other end, with Nick Pope required to demonstrate his strong positioning and reflexes on a number of occasions to deny Ricardo Pereira, Patson Daka and Harvey Barnes.The icing on the cake was Vardy's sharpness after coming on. He acrobatically volleyed one effort over, was quick and smart to stay onside and latch on to Kasper Schmeichel's clearance to set up Maddison and perfectly placed to claim his goal.The finish means he has now surpassed Ian Wright's record for most Premier League goals scored after turning 30, with the Leicester man taking his tally to 94.""It is great, probably just means I didn't score enough before 30,"" he added. ""Fingers crossed there's more to come.""He will now be champing at the bit to start against Leeds on Saturday. Burnley, meanwhile, have a tough home game against Chelsea as they again seek to claw their way out of the bottom three.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/59918930

He produced a busy performance and in the second half he made an excellent tackle to halt a Dinamo attack and immediately send Aubameyang away.His display should ensure he will not have to endure another long wait to pull on a Chelsea shirt again.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63479244

The wind was taken out their sails with just four minutes on the clock. In attempting to block Valverde's tame shot, Moritz Jenz got himself in an awful twist and handled the ball. Modric showed his customary coolness to slot home.The visitors responded well, fashioning decent openings for Kyogo Furuhashi and Reo Hatate, but neither could trouble Thibaut Courtois in the Real goal.In fact, the trouble was about to deepen for Celtic. Rodrygo's strike struck the arm of Matt O'Riley and, although not quite as clearly as the Jenz incident, the outcome was the same. This time Rodrygo converted the penalty.Vinicius missed an absolute sitter just a minute later as Real threatened to run away with it in the opening half-hour.Celtic had to get up the pitch and did so to great effect as Hatate robbed the ball to allow Daizan Maeda to put Kyogo through. However Courtois stood tall and was also equal to Hatate's piledriver from the edge of the box moments later.Then a huge chance for Celtic. Liel Abada's surge to the bye-line was checked by a foul by Ferland Mendy. It was a third penalty in a crazy first half, but Courtois foiled the Scottish champions again, diving to his right to push away Juranovic's spot-kick. Six minutes after the break, Real put the game beyond whatever little doubt still existed with their third goal. Dani Carvajal ghosted to the bye-line and his sliding cross teed-up Asensio to fire past Joe Hart.Vinicius added another after stealing ahead of Carl Starfelt to flash in a teasing Valverde cross before Real summoned Ballon D'or winner Karim Benzema from the bench on his return from injury.The Madridistas were enjoying themselves and Valverde added to that - and piled further pain on the visitors - when he curled a gorgeous effort beyond Hart and into the net.The Celtic fans could be forgiven for begging for the final whistle, but Jota gave them something to cheer when he curled a wonderful free-kick past Courtois.It was a lovely moment for the Portuguese winger and gave the visiting supporters something to cheer, but it was no more than a consolation on a night when the gulf between the champions of Scotland and the champions of Europe was laid bare.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63447097

And when his manager was yelling at him early in the game to get wider and make himself available for a pass, it was clear Guardiola would not be going easy on him either.But Lewis was happy to adopt the Joao Cancelo tactic of moving into midfield from his full-back berth when City pushed forward - and the long-range shot he screwed wide before the opening period drew to a close suggested no lack of confidence.His exchange of expressions when Phil Foden caught up with him after his goal was wonderful. Lewis' first City goal had come at a younger age than Foden's - he had to wait until he was 18.Lewis was only 13 when City last lost a European home game which is a startling statistic. The sustained ovation he received as he walked around the pitch to the bench after being told to leave it near the halfway line on the far side when he was replaced by Cancelo five minutes from time was the stuff dreams are made of.Sevilla flatter to deceiveSevilla have been a shadow of their former selves this season.Julen Lopetegui has already been sacked, thus allowing Wolves to make their move for him and his replacement Jorge Sampaoli has only managed two wins in seven games as his side dropped into the La Liga relegation zone. Yet, both in their starting line-up and on the bench, they have players of quality. At 34, Ivan Rakitic retains the smoothness on the ball that helped Croatia reach the World Cup final four years ago and Thomas Delaney was excellent in his Borussia Dortmund days.Mir failed to score in 17 combined appearances for Wolves and Nottingham Forest and has not found the net for Sevilla since August. Given the manner in which he guided his far-post header across goal and sent it curling into the far corner for his first-half opener, he should have done.It proved to be another false dawn for the Spanish side, who drop into the Europa League, a competition they have won a record six times, most recently in 2020, when they accounted for Wolves and Manchester United in the knockout phase.All the latest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views in one placeYou can now get Man City news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out more",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63480704

""As the game progressed, we saw that it was within our reach. I am very happy to have helped the team with another goal.""Until then it looked as if Nuno Mendes' second-half winner for PSG at Juventus would be enough for them to finish top.Kylian Mbappe gave PSG the lead with a fine solo opener before Leonardo Bonucci equalised for Juventus.PSG coach Christophe Galtier said: ""Firstly, congratulations to Benfica.

Jurgen Klopp's side were looking to bounce back from Saturday's home defeat by Leeds United and their spirits will be lifted by late goals from Mohamed Salah and Darwin Nunez which ended the impressive Serie A leaders' unbeaten 21-game run. Liverpool never looked remotely like securing the four-goal winning margin they would have needed against Napoli - who have exerted complete domination over the group - to finish top, but these three points will act as a real boost to morale. Thiago Alcantara brought a save from Napoli keeper Alex Meret in the first half, while Napoli thought they had broken the deadlock after the break only for defender Leo Ostigard's header from a free-kick to be ruled out for offside after a lengthy video assistant referee (VAR) examination. A game of few chances looked to be heading for a draw but Liverpool snatched the win when Mohamed Salah forced home a close-range finish with five minutes to go, with Nunez sealing the deal in added time.""I would have really enjoyed the game even without the goals,"" Klopp told BT Sport.""We showed tonight a reaction. Being compact makes all the difference. We have challenges in the right placed and are difficult to play against. You see what Napoli are able to do in the moment. ""It was a really good game for us.

They have beaten Manchester City and Napoli at Anfield without conceding a goal but also suffered those damaging losses to teams who have spent the early part of this term in struggle, as well as losing at Manchester United and Arsenal, two teams they have punished heavily in recent seasons.Liverpool looked more secure at the back, survived a VAR scare when Odigard thought he had scored, then ended the match on a high with those two late scrambled goals that will act as a real mood changer for manager Klopp, his players and the club's followers who have been so disappointed by their form so far this season.The key now is consistency and Liverpool face a serious test of their credentials when they travel to Tottenham, who savoured victory in Marseille that saw them win their group, for a Premier League tie on Sunday.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63462886

The stoppage-time winner by Hojbjerg also saw Marseille finish bottom of the group, meaning they missed out on a place in the Europa League as well as failing to progress to the knockout stage of the Champions League.Tottenham were under pressure for large spells - former Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez and Jordan Veretout were both denied for Marseille before Spurs improved in the second half. Harry Kane was inches from getting on the end of a cross to make it 1-1 just after half-time, before Lenglet capitalised on Spurs' improvement with a clever header from Ivan Perisic's free-kick.Tottenham striker Kane later had a goal disallowed when he was clearly offside, before Hojbjerg fired the ball against the crossbar.The drama continued as Marseille had a glorious chance to make it 2-1 with less than 10 minutes remaining when Sanchez's shot was crucially blocked by Perisic from close range before ex-Arsenal defender Sead Kolasinac headed wide while unmarked.But Tottenham managed to cling on and Kane held the ball up in the dying seconds before sliding it through for Hojbjerg to find the back of the net and silence a wild crowd in Marseille.Football Daily: Spurs snatch top spot with last-gasp winnerWho needs what in final group games - and who is throughVisit our Tottenham page for all the latest Spurs news, analysis and fan viewsAll-or-nothing evening in FranceClement Lenglet's goal put Spurs top of Group D before Frankfurt took the lead in Lisbon to move above them for most of the second halfTottenham were up against it from the first minute as they arrived at a hostile Stade Velodrome - which was not full as punishment for recent crowd trouble but nonetheless vociferous. Fireworks were set off in streets around the stadium before and during the match, while Marseille supporters gathered in clouds of smoke from flares to welcome their team before kick-off.Spurs were also without manager Antonio Conte as he served a touchline ban following the draw with Sporting Lisbon, but they knew a point would see them advance to the knockout stage.Tottenham assistant Cristian Stellini, who stood in for Conte, told BT Sport: ""I enjoyed it when we won. ""I spoke with Antonio. He's tired because to watch from the crowd is not normal. He wasted a lot of energy. ""It's better to stay on the touchline because you live the game like the players are doing.""Spurs had never beaten a French team away from home in Europe and were on the back foot in the first half with Hugo Lloris the busier goalkeeper.Both teams were dealt injury blows before the break too, as on-loan Manchester United centre-back Eric Bailly was forced off for Marseille before Tottenham's Son Heung-min suffered a heavy blow to the head.Son was struggling as he was helped off the pitch and down the tunnel following a four-minute stop in play for treatment. He was replaced by Yves Bissouma a minute later with Spurs playing with 10 men momentarily. Earlier on Tuesday, the Professional Footballers' Association renewed calls for temporary concussion substitutions, saying the current protocols are ""jeopardising player safety"".The second half was much improved from Spurs but at times they were cagey to defend their point and it almost allowed Marseille to cause an upset.Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris told BT Sport afterwards: ""It was a tough night, a great battle and even more [of a psychological battle]. ""We could feel in the first half a team was playing without the fear to lose - it was Marseille - and in the second half we had a team that was fearing to lose - and it was us.""When we had to face difficulties, we showed great personality and it's a great result.""The hosts had several big chances late on with Perisic's block and Kolasinac's miss huge moments in the game.In the end Marseille's push to find a winner cost them European football for the rest of the season, while Spurs sneak through with three wins from their six group matches.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63465588
297,Ajax 0-3 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp's side reach Champions League last 16,WED 26 Oct 2022,champions-league,"Mohamed Salah has scored six goals in his past four Champions League gamesLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says qualifying for the Champions League knockout phase should ""never be taken for granted"" after his side sealed their spot in the last 16.The Reds put their domestic woes behind them to progress from Group A with a clinical second-half display against Ajax in Amsterdam.Needing a draw to reach the next stage, Klopp's side were fortunate not to be behind before Mohamed Salah clipped in with their only shot on target of the first half.Darwin Nunez, back in the starting line-up after injury, should have doubled the lead before half-time but the £64m summer signing struck a post with an open goal in front of him.However, the Uruguay forward quickly made amends by powering in a precise header from Andy Robertson's corner shortly after the restart.Moments later, England Under-21 midfielder Harvey Elliott added the third by latching on to Salah's reverse pass and lashing into the roof of the net from a tight angle.Liverpool's decisive finishing clinched a place in the last 16 for the sixth successive season.""Qualifying for the knockout stages, I think nobody ever should take for granted - it's really difficult,"" said Klopp.""We did it again, which is a big achievement in itself.""The comfortable victory means the Reds host Napoli in next week's final round of group-stage fixtures safe in the knowledge their place is assured.Liverpool fan views and analysisFollow all the reaction to Liverpool's win at Ajax in the Champions LeagueLate VAR drama denies Spurs victory over SportingExperience sees Liverpool throughLiverpool's inconsistent start to the season, epitomised by another disjointed performance in a shock 1-0 Premier League defeat at Nottingham Forest at the weekend, has frustrated their supporters and left some wondering about the direction of Klopp's side.The prospect of a smooth passage to the Champions League knockout phase was far from certain after a 4-1 defeat by Napoli in their opening group game.But their vast experience in Europe's premier club competition, in which they were champions in 2019 and runners-up last season, has eventually provided much-needed comfort, as they brushed away any early fears of not progressing.Home and away victories over Rangers and Ajax have propelled the Reds into last 16, while the prize of finishing group winners is still up for grabs if they can beat Napoli by a four-goal margin at Anfield.Despite being far from their best in Amsterdam, particularly in the first half, Liverpool's quality and know-how eventually shone through against the Dutch champions.Asked if the performance would provide a lift for his squad, Klopp told BT Sport: ""Look, we don't have to talk about it all the time but it is clear. ""It is really helpful for the club, it is important for everybody and of course gives us a lift. Tonight we feel all great.""Things could have been much different had Ajax taken either of the two glorious chances which they spurned before Salah's strike.A slick move carved open the visitors in the third minute, only for Steven Berghuis to hit the post when he had time and space in the penalty box.With Liverpool lacking cohesion and not managing a serious effort on the home goal, another clear-cut chance went begging when they piled forward on the counter-attack shortly after the half-hour mark. The quick surge left Liverpool outnumbered at the back, but right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold showed excellent positional sense to block Dusan Tadic's goal-bound shot.Injuries to key players have not helped the Reds' momentum this season, a point emphasised by Klopp in the build-up to the trip to Amsterdam.Being able to welcome back Alexander-Arnold and captain Jordan Henderson added a much-needed layer of experience at Johan Cruyff Arena, with Nunez offering a focal point in their attack.Now Klopp's task is to ensure his side can finally start stringing together convincing performances in the Premier League, starting with Saturday's visit of a Leeds United side bereft of confidence.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63394507
298,Napoli 3-0 Rangers: Fifth Champions League loss for Ibrox side but hopes remain alive,WED 26 Oct 2022,champions-league,"Giovanni Simeone's two first-half goals had Napoli in command early onRangers suffered a fifth consecutive Champions League defeat at the hands of an accomplished Napoli, but escaped without any significant damage to their brittle confidence.Giovanni Simeone's brace in the opening 16 minutes had portended a chastening contest for the Scottish side, but the Serie A leaders would only add their third late on through Leo Ostigard.Rangers, too, can take solace from the fact there is some slim arithmetic hope of prolonging their campaign into the new year after Liverpool beat Ajax.That said, the Ibrox side would have to better the 4-0 margin meted out by the Dutch at the very start of this group stage when the two teams meet in Glasgow next Tuesday to reach their usual comfort zone of the Europa League.Can Rangers avoid Champions League ignominy?Reaction & as it happenedGet all the latest Rangers newsAjax, surely, won't be as good as this Napoli side, though. Few in Europe are right now. Even with Luciano Spalletti exploring some of his lesser-heralded options, the Italians were playing a different game to their willing, but fatally ill-equipped, visitors.And the way it started was entirely in keeping with a wretched campaign for the Ibrox side. A lapse in concentration 11 minutes in. Bang. Giovanni di Lorenzo slices a pass around Ben Davies and into the path of Giovanni Simone. Bang. The striker's finish is ruthless.Giovanni van Bronckhorst spoke pre-match of his side ""collapsing"" after conceding in recent times. The memories of Ajax and Liverpool remain raw. Time to take a breath, keep your shape, don't do anything daft. Don't allow Mario Rui to flash a cross in from the left. Don't allow Simeone to dart between two defenders and thump a header away from Allan McGregor. 'We have to be realistic and see the opponents we're playing against' - Van BronckhorstJust 16 minutes gone and Rangers must have felt like they were in a washing machine. Tanguy Ndombele scudded one against the bar and Giacomo Raspadori had a couple of near things before, mercifully for the Scots, the assault dissipated. Napoli returned to casually fizzing the ball between them, even generously allowing Rangers a turn now and again until the Scottish Premiership side inevitably gave it back. Even when they did have a rare moment of promise, such as the sleight of foot that allowed Malik Tillman to burrow into the box on a couple of occasions or Alfredo Morelos' snatched volley, they could not summon the insouciant quality that came so easily to their hosts.The one time they did, Morelos should have scored but somehow allowed Ridvan Yilmaz's teasing low cross to flash over his foot with the goal gaping. It would be his last act.It was also Rangers' last hope. Napoli - and Simeone - had gone close to a third a couple of times early in the second half, and moments after McGregor rescued his ragged defenders by denying Mario Rui, that goal came.It was more prosaic than might have been expected, but there was still much to admire in the way Ostigard contorted his neck to snap a header past the helpless goalkeeper and secure a club-record 12th consecutive win.The Rangers players were disconsolate but, given Liverpool gave them seven last time out and there were fears that Napoli could do the same, perhaps they will leave Italy thankful for small mercies.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63353343

'Champions League exit a blow to Barca's ego'Analysis by La Liga TV's Semra Hunter, speaking to BBC World ServiceIt doesn't look good. It is certainly a bruise to Barcelona's ego and their pride as a club. There has been so much pressure on them because of the financial pressure to deliver on the pitch and generate as much money as possible.It will be a really big blow for them not to get out of the group stage because they will have budgeted for making the quarter-finals. They will have to come up with other solutions - such as in the January transfer window, they may look to offload some of their higher earners.Barcelona still have possibilities to win silverware. The domestic cup is definitely attainable and they could still win the league of course. And the Europa League, why not? Yes this is a blow to their confidence in the short run but by the time we return from the World Cup it will be an entirely different situation.

302,Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Sporting Lisbon: Late VAR drama denies Harry Kane winner,WED 26 Oct 2022,champions-league,"Rodrigo Bentancur's equaliser ensured Spurs avoided a third successive defeat in all competitionsTottenham face a tense night in Marseille in their final Champions League group game to secure a place in the knockout phase after being denied victory in a dramatic finale against Sporting Lisbon. Spurs knew victory would guarantee a place in the last 16 but they laboured for long periods before being denied a last-gasp winner when Harry Kane's strike was ruled out for offside with manager Antonio Conte shown a red card in the ensuing chaos. In a tight encounter, former Spurs youngster Marcus Edwards gave Sporting a deserved 22nd-minute lead with a fine low shot as they punished Conte's side for a poor first-half display that brought loud jeers from the home fans. Spurs were much improved after the break but they were grateful to a crucial save by keeper Hugo Lloris from Sporting substitute Flavio Nazinho, who also shot wide with the goal at his mercy. They took advantage of those two escapes as Rodrigo Bentancur rose to head home from a corner 10 minutes from time - and in a hectic finish both sides had opportunities to win.Kane thought he had snatched it with virtually the last kick - only for VAR to decide otherwise and they now head to Marseille knowing defeat will put them at risk of elimination.Visit our Tottenham page for all the latest Spurs news, analysis and fan viewsYou can now get Spurs news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out moreSpurs pay for slow startSpurs were left regretting the intervention of VAR that denied them the win but they must also rue another slow start that allowed Sporting to take control for the first 45 minutes.The increasingly rebellious mood inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was reflected in the angry reaction from supporters who had grown frustrated at a series of aimless and misplaced passes allied to a lack of urgency.It was all so different after the break as Spurs came to life, finally applying pressure on Sporting and forcing keeper Antonio Adan into action.They still looked vulnerable, however, and Lloris - rightly criticised for his errors in the home defeat against Newcastle United on Sunday - came to the rescue with that crucial save from Nazinho, although the Sporting forward should have made no mistake with a second chance which he steered wide of an open goal.Spurs, having got themselves back into the game, had chances to get the three points that would have made the trip to Marseille a formality but Eric Dier and Bentancur could not find the target.The game ended in a melee, with Conte being sent off after wildly celebrating what he thought was the goal that secured the knockout place when Kane swept home Emerson Royal's knockdown.Spurs have work to do in Marseille, a job expected to be made more difficult with Conte likely to serve a touchline ban for his red card, and they must learn the lessons of being punished for leaving it late to kick into gear.Tottenham 1-1 Sporting Lisbon: Antonio Conte furious at 'unfair' VAR decisionEdwards shows his quality It was perhaps inevitable that Marcus Edwards would score on his return to Spurs, the club where he could not make the breakthrough despite his talent. The 23-year-old is fulfilling his potential in Lisbon and followed up a fine performance in the first group game, which Sporting won 2-0, with another display rich in promise here. He was a constant threat until he faded after the break, threatening several times in the first half and giving Sporting the lead with a low short drilled beyond Lloris as Spurs paid the price for standing off.Edwards is now bolting on attitude to ability and will have impressed all observers, and those who remember him from his unfulfilled Spurs career, with how he performed here.

They raced into a two-goal lead as Hirving Lozano sent a looping header into the far corner and Giacomo Raspadori thumped a left-footed drive into the roof of the net. Ex-Everton man Davy Klaasen's header reduced Ajax's arrears after the break, before Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's penalty, harshly awarded for handball against Jurrien Timber after a Video Assistant Referee review, extended Napoli's lead back to two goals.The visitors were then given a late penalty when Juan Jesus was adjudged to have fouled Brian Brobbey, with former Tottenham forward Steven Bergwijn converting to cause a nervy finale. However, those nerves were settled when Victor Osimhen harried Daley Blind into a mistake and tapped into the empty net for his first Champions League goal of the season. The result leaves Napoli, who have now scored 17 goals in their four group games, in pole position to top group A, at the expense of Liverpool.

The striker netted three times in his sensational first 13 minutes on the pitch to silence a once-euphoric Ibrox crowd.Scott Arfield had given Rangers an early lead with their first group goal, but a Roberto Firmino double and a Darwin Nunez strike set Liverpool on their way, with Harvey Elliott getting a seventh after a VAR check.It was a mesmeric second-half performance from the Premier League club, who now just need a draw against Ajax in Amsterdam in two weeks to advance to the next stage.A beleaguered Rangers are still searching for their first points, and their hopes turn to trying to finish third in Group A and claim a Europa League place. It does not get any easier for them, though, as they travel to face group leaders Napoli next.Big dog roars louder as Rangers' bark falls silentEverything you need to know about RangersGet all the best Liverpool contentRangers must 'change mentality'Reaction & as it happenedAs Salah trotted on to the Ibrox pitch, it was with little fanfare. Nunez had just given the visitors a commanding 3-1 lead, and the Egyptian's introduction seemed almost like the cherry on the cake after a tasty game had been yanked away from Rangers.But a player whose stellar form has dipped to merely good this term produced something special - the fastest ever Champions League hat-trick.It started with an old-fashioned toe poke from a tight angle. Salah was off and running. A handful of minutes later, a drop of the shoulder, a quick change of pace on the edge of the box, and a deceptive finish brought his second. Ibrox, not for the first or last time in the half, fell silent.There was barely time to type his name as the player of the match before his astonishing intervention was complete with yet another composed finish.After just 17 minutes of this frenzied contest, it looked all so different. All of Liverpool's wins since August have come in Europe, but another looked unlikely amid a cacophony of noise in Govan. A flowing Rangers move cleaved open a static Liverpool defence and allowed Arfield space to steer a shot low across Alisson and into the net. Finally Rangers had arrived in this year's Champions League.It was an arrival which was celebrated for seven minutes. Kostas Tsimikas' whipped corner to the near post found an unmarked and grateful Firmino, who nodded in from six yards. Ten minutes after the break, Firmino hushed a raucous crowd again. Joe Gomez's rampaging run down the right created the opening, and his inch-perfect delivery found the Brazilian on the run for a low first-time steer through Allan McGregor's legs. The writing was on the wall for Rangers by this point, and it was absolutely game over on 66 minutes. Again Firmino was involved, his cute flick teeing up Nunez for a curling shot around McGregor from the edge of the box for a goal met with a ferocious punch of the air by manager Jurgen Klopp.After Salah was finished stealing the show, there was still time for more as Elliott got in on the act. The youngster was originally flagged for offside after volleying in, before a VAR check reversed the decision and sent him jogging away in celebration to a jubilant band of supporters in the far corner.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63186550

Having been beaten in the San Siro last week, Xavi's side went into the game knowing that they realistically needed to win to maintain hope of progressing from Group C, with teams on the same points split by their head-to-head record.The draw leaves Inter - who sit second, behind Bayern Munich who progressed on Wednesday - three points ahead of Barcelona, with both to still play Bayern and Viktoria Plzen. With Bayern already through, an Inter Milan home win on Wednesday, 26 October (17:45), against bottom side Viktoria Plzen will confirm Barca's elimination.Guillem Balague: Are Barcelona gambling with their future or just giving fans hope? (August)Barcelona boss Xavi said: ""We're depending on another team to go through. They are our mistakes, we have to improve them. That's the reality. The [improvement] process is longer than we thought in Europe.""There are other competitions, La Liga, the Copa del Rey, the Super Copa. We have to insist, persist, believe.""When you draw at home with these fans, with this atmosphere, it is my fault. I am angry. My feeling is that this competition has been, and is still being, cruel with us.""Barcelona play Bayern at the Nou Camp on Wednesday, 26 October but could already be eliminated by thenBarcelona took the lead just before half-time when Raphinha did well to keep the ball in, before threading through for Sergi Roberto, who squared for Ousmane Dembele to tap home.It cued joyous and extravagant celebrations from boss Xavi and the whole Barcelona dugout but that soon turned to despair in the second half.Nicolo Barella latched onto an Alessandro Bastoni dinked ball and lashed into the roof of the net to pull Inter level, before Lautaro Martinez chested a right-wing cross from Hakan Calhanoglu inside Eric Garcia, with his effort hitting both posts before going over the line.It led to a cauldron of noise at the Nou Camp, and that pressure eventually told when Poland striker Robert Lewandowski saw a header fall back at his feet, and his deflected effort squeezed past Andre Onana. From there the game descended into chaos.Inter took the lead again as Onana cleared quickly for Martinez, who squared for Robin Gosens to lash home and leave Barcelona out of the competition again. However, that was not the end of the drama, as Lewandowski rose highest to meet Garcia's cross from the right and head past Onana and keep the hosts' hopes alive again.Inter then had two chances to win it on the break as Kristjan Asllani was put through but Marc-Andre ter Stegen saved with his legs, before Gosens saw a header saved.  Barca pay price for defensive deficiencies Throughout the game, but particularly in the second half, Inter were able to cut through Barcelona at will.Gerard Pique came in at the heart of defence because of injuries, but he was at fault for Barella's goal, misjudging the flight of the ball, before Garcia was easily beaten for the second goal.The third goal came from one straight ball, and Martinez was able to cross along the entire width of the penalty area for Gosens to lash home.After the remarkable 92nd-minute equaliser from Lewandowski, Barca pushed forward, leaving large gaps for Inter to exploit.If Simone Inzaghi's side had been more clinical Barcelona would be out in the group stages for the second successive season, after a run of 17 years in the knockout stages.There were promising signs, with summer signing Raphinha impressing on the right, and Lewandowski again demonstrating the prolific scoring ability he's shown throughout his career, but their defensive issues against top-level sides will be of major concern to Xavi. Barcelona won't have long to regroup either. They are unbeaten so far in La Liga and sit top but face Real Madrid - also unbeaten and separated from their rivals only by goal difference - on Sunday in the first El Clasico of the season.'Barca not far off, but not ready to compete reliably' - analysis Ernest Macia - Spanish football journalist on BBC Radio 5 LiveThis will be a big disappointment because the financial situation is critical to the club and therefore so is advancing in the Champions League. It means many millions. It's now a big setback.I don't think he's [Xavi] under pressure but we have to know that the team is under construction. The team has talent but that talent is in their 20s or their 30s. The team lacks talent from the ages 25-29.We saw a fragile team in defence, with many missing defenders. The team is under construction and he wants time and for the younger players to gain experience.Lewandowski scored two goals but he's 35. In two years time, Barcelona will probably be a more reliable team.This group was very difficult. The Champions League pulls you to your limit and it's a very physical competition. A few months ago, we were saying they're a broken club. There's been big investment but not enough, they need more physical players in the Champions League. Maybe three or four more.They're not far off but they're either too young or too old to compete at this level reliably.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63221311

Reaction to Wednesday's Champions League Visit our Tottenham page for all the latest Spurs news, analysis and fan views in one placeTottenham looked back to their best at times and could have won by a greater margin, but sloppy mistakes kept Frankfurt in the game.The visitors largely struggled to deal with Spurs' attack but goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was forced to tip over an effort by Jesper Lindstrom and there was some desperate defending as Frankfurt had chances late on. Antonio Conte's hosts threatened throughout with Son, Ryan Sessegnon, Richarlison and Cristian Romero among those to come close.It was a frantic finale but victory means Tottenham sit top of the group with two wins from four matches, while Frankfurt drop to the bottom of the table with four points. Tottenham next host Sporting Lisbon on 26 October.Spurs' attack in potent moodSon Heung-min scored his fifth Champions League braceFrankfurt dominated early on and pressed and harried Spurs, leading to a mistake from Dier and the opening goal from Kamada, who had already come close when just failing to connect with Lindstrom's curling cross. But it did not take long for Tottenham to capitalise on the gaping spaces left in behind by Frankfurt.Kane and Son were on form, linking up fluently and causing havoc as Richarlison worked tirelessly to create space for his team-mates to run into. The efficiency of Spurs' attacking line-up was too much for Frankfurt and it was only a matter of time before the hosts turned things around.Kane won and converted a penalty when he was bundled over in the box by Kristijan Jakic less than 10 minutes after he had set up Son for the equaliser. Son, who came off to a standing ovation, capped off a superb performance with a thumping volley before half-time. Kane and Son have now linked up 50 times to score for Tottenham in all competitions and Richarlison's addition to the squad has added further attacking threat. The Brazilian almost set up Sessegnon with a brilliant curling cross early in the second half and was unfortunate not to score when he headed inches wide in the opening period.Tottenham should have finished with a comfortable victory but the late header from Alidou gave way a wild few minutes as Spurs substitute Bryan Gil missed a diving header, was then fouled in the box to earn a penalty and Kane uncharacteristically fired it over the bar. The crowd roared with urgency as Tottenham threw bodies in front of the ball to block a late onslaught from the visitors but they hung on to claim victory.It was a positive night for Tottenham overall as they also welcomed the return of Lucas Moura, who came on as a substitute for his first appearance since August due to injury.

I don't want to comment. I told the referee what I think, I don't speak English very well but I think he understood.""Mount was excellent for the first 45 minutes before being substituted for Conor Gallagher at half-time, having picked up a booking for arguing with Olivier Giroud in the aftermath of the penalty.Potter decided to remove Mount from the firing line of both the irate home fans and the card-happy Siebert - but not before the England midfielder caused Milan endless problems and showed why he is so admired by his managers for club and country.While his form is a boost for Gareth Southgate, the sight of James hobbling off minutes after jarring his knee in the turf while making a challenge is worrying, with the World Cup less than six weeks away.Having been so well stocked at right-back previously, Southgate is now sweating on the fitness of James as well as Kyle Walker and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who have all suffered injuries in recent weeks.Four in a row for PotterOnly two players have started all five of Potter's games in charge of Chelsea so far - goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and Mount.The latter was central to the second goal too. He was played the ball on the edge of the Milan area by Jorginho, and cleverly laid it off first time. Both Raheem Sterling and Aubameyang were running on, and the former smartly moved out of the way for the latter to plant the ball beyond Ciprian Tatarusanu at his near post.From then on it was fairly straightforward for Chelsea to earn only their second competitive win on Italian soil from 15 attempts, the last being a 4-0 victory for Claudio Ranieri's side at Roberto Mancini's Lazio in November 2003.They came the closer of the two sides to scoring in the second half, with Gallagher hitting the side-netting after rounding Tatarusanu.It is a fourth successive win for Potter, with Chelsea continuing an impressive turnaround by rising to the top of Group E after four games, having been bottom after matchday two.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63208848

Leipzig showed the ruthless edge Celtic lacked with late goals from Timo Werner and substitute Emil Forsberg.It leaves the Scottish champions bottom with one point from four games.But while a top-two finish is now beyond Celtic, their hopes of salvaging a Europa League place were boosted by Real Madrid's late equaliser away to Shakhtar Donetsk, who are now four points ahead in third and visit Glasgow in a fortnight.Everything you need to know about Celtic'Different movie, same ending for profligate Celtic'Celtic's Euro improvement 'can't be fast-tracked'Podcast: 'Wasted opportunities are recurring theme'Celtic's group-stage failings were encapsulated in a dizzying sequence midway through the first half. O'Riley rattled the base of a post with a 20-yard strike and Taylor pounced on the loose ball only to scuff it on to the bar with the goal at his mercy.Seconds later, Kyogo grazed the woodwork with a gilt-edged header from Sead Haksabanovic's delivery.Maeda had set the tone of frustration in the opening seconds, scooping an awkward header inches over, and wasteful finishing is ultimately what has condemned Celtic to an exit with two games to spare.They were eventually undone by a slick Leipzig outfit that had found Joe Hart in imposing form. The Celtic goalkeeper, who gifted a goal in last week's defeat in Germany, stuck out a leg to brilliantly divert Christopher Nkunku's powerful drive past a post then spread himself to foil Willi Orban.Celtic looked increasingly ragged as the second half swung from end to end and the only surprise was how long it took for a goal to arrive. Leipzig full-back Mohamed Simakan blazed over at one end, Maeda volleyed Aaron Mooy's cross wide at the other. But Leipzig's growing menace was rewarded when Werner guided a header from Andre Silva's drilled cross into the bottom corner.Still Celtic had chances, with substitute Giorgos Giakoumakis unable to convert from close range.But Leipzig put the result beyond doubt when Werner rolled a pass to Forsberg, who took a touch then sent an unerring finish into the top corner.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63186516

The decision again came after the Portuguese referee Artur Dias was referred to the pitch-side monitor and left the English champions forced to reshape and play the final hour a man down.Erling Haaland was left on the bench against opponents that had suffered a 5-0 thrashing in Manchester just under a week ago.

The Italians almost equalised right on half-time when Rade Krunic fired over with the goal at his mercy.It was a rare anxious moment and the second half belonged to Chelsea, and James in particular, the right-back demonstrating why he commands such faith at club level and from England manager Gareth Southgate.James was the provider after 56 minutes when he crossed for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to apply a simple finish, then he was the finisher five minutes later with a powerful strike which flew high past Milan keeper Ciprian Tatarusanu at his near post.All the best Chelsea content in one place'James' quality reduced to England footnote'Chelsea deliver for PotterPotter will be delighted with the manner of this important win, not only because it gave Chelsea the three points they needed to boost their chances of reaching the Champions League knockout stage, but it was also just the sort of victory and performance any new manager wants early in their reign.Chelsea stuttered against Salzburg and Potter admitted they rode their luck to beat Crystal Palace on Saturday but was this a comprehensive triumph over a Milan side that rarely threatened, apart from when the pacy and talented Rafael Leao was in possession, carving out the clear chance which Krunic somehow missed on the stroke of half-time.Otherwise, this was a tale of Chelsea domination, the night only clouded by that injury to Fofana that Potter will hope does not prove serious.After Fofana's opening goal, it was left to James to demonstrate exactly why England manager Southgate is prepared to ignore the lobby for Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold to get a place in the England team at right-back.James is close to the complete defender, solid in defence and also potent in attack here, making Aubameyang's job easy for Chelsea's second then crashing in the third himself.James goes about his business quietly but ability, power and attitude make him a formidable proposition.Aubameyang finds his touchAubameyang may have been taken aback when Tuchel, the manager who worked with him at Borussia Dortmund and was central to his arrival at Chelsea from Barcelona, was sacked shortly after his return.Chelsea and Potter moved to reassure the striker about his situation and he is starting to prove exactly why they were so keen to bring him back from Catalonia, where he moved after he was exiled at Arsenal.He showed his expertise with a goal in the win at Crystal Palace and demonstrated his poacher's instinct here with an instinctive finish from James' cross.Aubameyang will be a serious weapon for Potter and Chelsea if he regains top form and he looks in the mood to enjoy his career at Stamford Bridge.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63080704

Jota's equaliser was a well-worked goal, as Reo Hatate picked off a slack pass before feeding Kyogo Furuhashi, who crossed for his Portuguese team-mate to slide home.And before that point, Kyogo himself had a header flash just wide, as well as another shot deflected just past a post, while Hatate and Moritz Jenz also had good opportunities.But ultimately it was a similar story to the defeat by Real Madrid and draw with Shakhtar Donetsk, where Celtic were not clinical enough in front of goal, while mistakes at key moments were punished.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63111929

Liverpool never looked back and Rangers never mounted a serious threat.Liverpool's only disappointment was that they did not make the most of the host of chances they created, with the hard-working Nunez hitting the target with most of his efforts and showing good movement, only to put his finishes too close to McGregor on too many occasions.For all their domination, Liverpool relied on a brilliant free-kick and a penalty to secure the win.It was the ideal game for them to gain some rhythm and momentum, with Klopp selecting an all-out attacking line-up with a front four of Salah, Nunez, Diaz and Diogo Jota.They will surely face a tougher test at a hostile Ibrox in the return game but this simply could not have been more comfortable, making it a satisfactory night for Klopp, who wanted to see Liverpool edging somewhere back towards their best.The win also leaves Liverpool well placed to reach the knockout stage, sitting second with six points from three games and a three-point lead over third-placed Ajax, who lost 6-1 at home to Napoli.You can now get Liverpool news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out moreGo to our Liverpool page for all the latest Reds news and viewsTough night for RangersRangers appeared to be mounting little more than a damage limitation exercise once they lost an early goal, the gulf in class between the two sides immediately apparent and not reflected in final scoreline.They did not pose any sort of threat until it was too late, with that Tsimikas clearance and an Alisson block from Antonio Colak providing a very rare anxious moment for Liverpool.

The goal was ruled out via VAR, and Barcelona manager Xavi was booked for complaining to the referee.""The referee should be out here explaining why he makes these decisions, if he made mistakes or not. That would humanise them a lot more,"" said Xavi.""Today I'm really unhappy. I feel there is real injustice.""Before the match, it was Xavi's Inter counterpart Simone Inzaghi who was under pressure. His team are ninth in Serie A after losing four of their eight league games this season.He had the additional headache of facing in-form Robert Lewandowski, who had scored nine goals in his past seven games for Barca, although he had never netted at the San Siro.It is a barren run that continued for Lewandowski as he endured a quiet night in Milan, while Inzaghi celebrated a key win that puts Inter in the driving seat for a place in the knockout stage.'We have three more finals to come'Xavi said he was ""offended"" by the refereeing decisionsThe first VAR flashpoint occurred on 24 minutes - Eric Garcia clearly handled the ball in the area and a penalty appeared certain to be given after video review. However, a marginal offside was spotted in the build-up and Barca escaped.An evenly matched game was then decided by Calhanoglu's goal in first-half added time, his low and well-struck 25-yard strike from a central position skidding across the turf past Ter Stegen for the midfielder's first Champions League goal in five years.Barcelona offered very little until the hour mark, when Dembele struck the post with a powerful effort from the left after good team build-up. A few minutes later Pedri had the ball in the net - but VAR intervened.They could not break through thereafter, despite the latter stages being played in Inter's half, with echoes of their most famous meeting in 2010 when a Jose Mourinho masterclass saw his Milan side reach the final on their way to the Treble.There was time for one last VAR incident when Denzel Dumfries appeared to handle in the area. However it was ruled he had not conclusively knocked a cross away from Fati with his wrist.Xavi knows the return fixture with Inter at Camp Nou in eight days' time will most likely be decisive for their European hopes this season.""We have three more finals to come,"" he said. ""This is a game we have lost, but now we have two games at home from the three and they are real finals.""We have to show more intensity. The first half wasn't good, we have to be self critical - but of course we are offended today.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63080315
333,Eintracht Frankfurt 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur: Antonio Conte urges Spurs to be more clinical,TUE 04 Oct 2022,champions-league,"Harry Kane is yet to score in this season's Champions LeagueAntonio Conte was pleased to see his side creating chances against Eintracht Frankfurt but accepts they need to become more clinical after they were held to a goalless draw in the Champions League Group D game.The visitors, looking to respond after losing to Premier League rivals Arsenal at the weekend, put in a largely encouraging display but were let down by poor finishing. Harry Kane was agonisingly close to turning in a Son Heung-min cross before swiping a shot wide in the first half, while Ivan Perisic saw a deflected strike go just wide of the far post before the break.But the hosts also had chances, with Hugo Lloris needing to produce a smart save to deny Ansgar Knauff's volley from close range and Jesper Lindstrom drove over from a good position.""It was a good match. We played with great intensity,"" said Conte. ""I think we need to be more clinical. We created many, many chances to score. It's not easy to play away with this atmosphere, I think my players coped with that well.""In football you have to score. I think for the big effort for the whole team maybe we deserved much more. The most important thing for me is to create chances.""The draw means Tottenham are second in Group D with four points after three games, two points behind leaders Sporting Lisbon, who lost 4-1 at Marseille earlier on Tuesday.

334,Rangers 0-3 Napoli: Serie A leaders claim victory against 10-man hosts,WED 14 Sept 2022,champions-league,"Napoli scored twice in the final five minutes to record a 3-0 winTen-man Rangers fell to their third consecutive heavy defeat without scoring despite a more encouraging performance against Napoli on a dramatic night in the Champions League.Matteo Politano's penalty and late strikes from Giacomo Raspadori and Tanguy Ndombele secured victory, but only after Allan McGregor twice denied Piotr Zielinski from the spot.James Sands was sent off for conceding the first penalty and, though McGregor saved twice following a VAR check for encroachment, he did not deny Politano.The Italian forward put the ball low into the corner beyond the reach of the 40-year-old Rangers keeper after Borna Barisic was penalised for handball.Substitute Raspadori finished neatly with five minutes left to end the home side's challenge before Ndombele stroked another goal home in stoppage time against a tiring Rangers backline.Victory means Napoli top Group A with maximum points after two games, with Rangers winless ahead of back-to-back meetings with Liverpool next.Napoli game 'a lot better' but what now for Rangers?Rangers play national anthem before kick-offReaction & as it happenedThose matches will prove another stern test for Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side, but this performance will provide more hope than their recent 4-0 defeats at the hands of Ajax and Celtic, despite the scoreline. Until going down to 10 men, this was much more like the Rangers of last season's Europa League, as they played with more energy from the start, after an emotionally-charged Ibrox paid tribute to Queen Elizabeth before kick-off.Alfredo Morelos - starting for the first time since March - headed over after just 35 seconds as Rangers hunted Napoli high up the pitch. Scott Arfield forced a fine save from Alex Meret before the break and Connor Goldson went close shortly after the interval with a header.Even as Napoli continued to threaten, McGregor - returning to the team due to Jon McLaughlin's injury - was set to become the hero again when he denied Zielinski after Sands felled Giovanni Simeone in the box when he was clean through.Politano swept in the rebound, but was judged to have encroached after a lengthy VAR check. That meant Zielenski stepped up again, but the Pole found no more joy the second time round as he went for the same corner.But Napoli - who also created plenty of chances before eventually breaking the deadlock - kept coming and Politano got his goal when Barisic's outstretched arm blocked a goal-bound shot, resulting in another penalty.From there, Rangers struggled as Napoli used the strength of their bench to kill the match. Raspadori only needed a sniff in the box to lash beyond McGregor, while Ndombele was imposing and swept home nicely after a tidy lay off from Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa.It was another brutal lesson for Rangers against a top-quality team, as if they needed it following a difficult opening match in Amsterdam and with back-to-back games with Liverpool to come.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62863101

336,Chelsea 1-1 FC Red Bull Salzburg: Hosts held to draw on Potter's first outing as manager,WED 14 Sept 2022,champions-league,"Raheem Sterling has scored four goals in eight appearances this season for ChelseaGraham Potter began his Chelsea reign with a draw against Red Bull Salzburg, leaving his side with an uphill task to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages.In his competition debut, the former Brighton boss picked Raheem Sterling as an advanced wing-back but saw the gamble pay off when the forward curled into the bottom corner shortly after the break. It was a much-improved performance from Chelsea's defeat by Dinamo Zagreb in their opening Group E game last week, which spelled the end for former manager Thomas Tuchel. But Matthias Jaissle's well-drilled Austrian side got an equaliser on 75 minutes when Thiago Silva missed a tackle, allowing Noah Okafor to clip in Junior Adamu's low cross. That goal highlighted the risks involved in Potter's positive approach, with Sterling and Marc Cucurella caught out of position. But the hosts could have earned victory when Reece James fired over from a free-kick and substitute Hakim Ziyech almost headed in at the back post.Following AC Milan's earlier 3-1 win over Zagreb, Chelsea sit bottom of Group E after two games with the Serie A champions up next at Stamford Bridge on 5 October. 'They gave everything' - Potter proud of Chelsea Chelsea 1-1 FC Red Bull Salzburg: 'We can't lie - it's not the position we want to be in'Potter-ball shows risks and rewardsPotter was appointed six days ago, and following a week which he called a ""whirlwind"" got his first taste of Champions League football, having never seen the competition before in the flesh. There have been questions about his credentials, having managed for only three years in the Premier League with Brighton. And although it was a positive display from his side and they wasted several good chances late on with Armando Broja also firing over, he will now realise he has to quickly turn things around in Europe after Chelsea's poor start to the season. The 47-year-old, who watched in a black suit as Stamford Bridge observed impeccably a minute's silence to mark the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, quickly established his own stamp on the team by dropping Wesley Fofana, Kalidou Koulibaly and Ben Chilwell from the side that lost at Dinamo Zagreb last week. That saw Silva and Cucurella make up a back three with Cesar Azpilicueta, but the biggest surprise was seeing Sterling at left wing-back in a 3-4-3 formation. That may have been too simplistic, though, as the forward was stationed way up the pitch for the most part and twice wasted good chances at the back post in the first half. The closest the two teams came to opening the scoring before the break came within a minute of each other. Mason Mount sliced a shot inches wide of the post after another deep run and cross from Cucurella, before Benjamin Sesko had a curling effort tipped around the post by Kepa Arrizabalaga after Sterling gave the ball away. But the England international made up for that mistake and showed why he was positioned so far up the pitch three minutes after the break. James started the move on the right flank with a powerful run and fed Mount, whose low cross was miscontrolled by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Fortunately, Sterling took a measured touch before finding the inside of the post for his fourth of the season. At that stage Chelsea began to control the game and looked like they would add to their lead. However, the desire to play in Salzburg's half backfired when both Sterling and Cucurella were dispossessed near the halfway line, leading to the equaliser.Once the ball was played wide of Silva, he seemed as if he would close down Adamu and avert danger. But the normally reliable Brazilian missed the tackle, with Okafor adding to the goal he scored against AC Milan in Salzburg's draw last week. There were plenty of chances for Chelsea to take the lead again as Potter made five substitutes in search of a goal. But the Austrian champions held on after Ziyech and Broja were wasteful.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62895693
337,Shakhtar Donetsk 1-1 Celtic: Scottish champions held in Warsaw by Ukrainians,WED 14 Sept 2022,champions-league,"Rio Hatate squeezed the ball through the narrowest of gaps to open the scoringCeltic endured a frustrating night in Warsaw as a resolute Shakhtar Donetsk side held them in a Champions League draw. A deflected Reo Hatate effort had the dominant Scots deservedly ahead after just 10 minutes. But a blistering run and finish from Mykhaylo Mudryk levelled the tie before the break. Celtic spurned several chances to claim the victory in the second half, with substitutes Giorgos Giakoumakis and Daizen Maeda missing opportunities late on.After losing 3-0 to Real Madrid in their opener last week in Glasgow, and drawing here, Celtic's tough start continues with a trip to Germany to face RB Leipzig, who lost 2-0 in Madrid on Wednesday, in three weeks' time.Is there more to come from Celtic in Europe?Celtic were hunting for their first Champions League win in almost five years. You have to go back to 27 September, 2017 for their last one - against Anderlecht in Belgium - and the path to victory was mapped out early for the Scottish champions.On the eve of the game, both teams alluded to the fact Shakhtar, playing their group games in Warsaw due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, would sit deep and look to strike on the break - as they did against Leipzig last week in a surprise 4-1 win.That approach was evident as the Scots poured forward with the energy and movement that gave Real Madrid an early fright last week, with the Ukrainians being suckered by their own gameplan after just 10 minutes.A burst of orange jerseys sprung forward into the Celtic half only for Josip Juranovic's true clearance to zip long to Sead Haksabanovic. The Swede's control and pass to the in-rushing Hatate was perfect, with the Japanese darting into the box to squeeze a ball through the tightest of gaps off the sliding Artem Bandarenko and into the net.Given Celtic had already gone close through Kyogo Furuhashi and Greg Taylor prior to the opener, they were in firm control as defender Mortiz Jenz's half volley from a knockdown was then parried away by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin. However, just as the Scottish Premiership leaders appeared in command, a blistering counter levelled the game. A neat ball inside Juranovic was latched on to by Mudryk. The strapping 21-year-old raced away from the chasing full-back and crashed a left-foot shot high across a sprawling Joe Hart.It could have been worse moments later as Marian Shved, once the forgotten man of Parkhead, slammed the ball low under Hart at the second attempt. Thankfully for his old team, Mudryk was flagged for offside before a cute cut back.Celtic dictated most of the play in a frustrating second half. Shakhtar's flurries forward were much more tame, while their goal led a charmed life at times thanks to their visitors' wastefulness in front of goal and savvy keeping from Trubin.Jota was denied soon after the break by the goalkeeper, substitute David Turnbull arced a shot just over and Jota meandered his way through a glut of Shakhtar players before a deflected off-balance shot trundled out for a corner.As the time ticked down, Celtic stepped it up again. Substitute Giakoumakis lashed wide when unmarked from 14 yards and Daizen Maeda hid his head in the turf in frustration as he failed to turn in a drilled cross in the closing minutes.And, with only a few seconds left, Giakoumakis outjumped Trubin to head the ball goalward, only for a orange jersey to scramble it clear.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62863118

He re-enacted the moment but, understandably, without his son's elasticity and elegance.Haaland's goal was his 13th of the season and his 26th in 21 Champions League games.City's fans rejoiced as this was exactly the sort of moment the 22-year-old was signed for, to decide big Champions League games that looked to be getting away from them.It means City now have a maximum return from two games and a striker every team in the competition will fear.Bellingham's show of classBellingham embraced his former Dortmund team-mate Haaland, the pain of defeat mixed with a resigned smile at the world-class goal that undid so much good work by the Bundesliga side.It was mutual admiration as Haaland will have appreciated the sheer class of the 19-year-old England midfielder, who was the game's most significant presence until City launched that late turnaround.Bellingham demonstrates a maturity beyond his years with the perfect range of passing, composure and also an eye for a goal as he reacted quicker than City's defenders to divert Reus' cross past Ederson.Gareth Southgate names his next England squad on Thursday. Bellingham is now producing a growing body of evidence to suggest he must be a starter ahead of Kalvin Phillips, who has barely played since moving to City from Leeds United.And he was certainly more impressive than the disappointing Jack Grealish, who could have had no complaints when he was substituted as City manager Guardiola tried to get his side back into the game after Dortmund took the lead.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62894559

Benfica, meanwhile, have won all 12 of their games this season, with a first victory in Italy since 1997 the latest.They found the winner in the second half when Neres slotted home on the rebound after Mattia Perin parried an initial shot.Juventus had earlier gone in front when Milik flicked in a free-kick, but were pegged back when Fabio Miretti was adjudged to have conceded a penalty following a VAR review.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62909073

Boss Jurgen Klopp demanded a reaction to the ""horror show"" of the 4-1 defeat at Napoli in their group opener and this was certainly a vast improvement. Liverpool created plenty of openings and deservedly went ahead when Mohamed Salah swept home Diogo Jota's pass. Mohammed Kudus' searing shot went in off the underside of the bar to level but Matip pounced in the 89th minute.Daley Blind missed a great chance to put Ajax ahead late on before Matip - whose previous Champions League goal was nine years ago - rose to head the winner, which was confirmed by goal-line technology.Liverpool 'braver' in win over Ajax - Jurgen KloppLiverpool's persistence pays offLiverpool needed to respond to the debacle of Napoli and while they were nowhere near their best this was all about getting the victory that would make Champions League Group A look more positive for Klopp's side.It looked for a long time that Ajax's composed manner allied to Liverpool's lack of cutting edge might mean they would have one point from two games as they prepare to play Rangers home and away.Instead, Matip's winner ensured an important three points for last season's beaten finalists and Klopp will hope it is the start of their recovery from the defeat in Italy he labelled the worst performance of his reign at Anfield.Before the game, there was a short period of silence in tribute to Queen Elizabeth II and while there were a handful of dissenting voices, they were hushed by the vast majority of those inside Anfield, who observed the tribute respectfully.Tributes to Queen Elizabeth II observedOnce the action started, match-winner Matip and Thiago Alcantara were the keys to Liverpool's improvement from last week at Napoli, the defender not only being strong at the back but bringing the ball out of defence in his typical adventurous manner.The former Schalke defender's decisive late contribution capped an outstanding display and he made Klopp's defence look far more solid than in Italy last week.Thiago's ability to dictate the tempo has been sorely missed while he has been injured and his performance was a signpost to how important he will be as Liverpool try to recover from an indifferent start to their season.Klopp heralded the improvement, but warned his side there was still some way to go to recover their best form.""I think if we put the two games, Napoli and tonight, next to each other, you don't recognise properly that it's the same sport,"" said Klopp.""It was all different. The start was different. The middle was different. The finish was different. ""The way we played, the way we defend, everything was different. Much higher intensity, much more aggression, braver, more ready, everything was better.""It's the first step, nothing else, not more.""Kudus shows his classAjax are surpassed by very few clubs in world football in terms of unearthing talent and the latest gem looks to be Ghana forward Kudus.The 22-year-old forward was strongly linked with a move to Everton at the end of the transfer window but Ajax blocked the deal given they were about to lose Antony to Manchester United.Ajax believe Kudus will make a key contribution to their season - and presumably that his value will therefore significantly increase.They have been proved correct so far. He was outstanding in the 4-0 thrashing of Rangers in Ajax's opening group game and his fierce finish at Anfield was a sign of the quality the powerful, skilful forward possesses.He thumped in an emphatic equaliser off the underside of the bar after he was played in by Steven Berghuis and Steven Bergwijn. Ajax will naturally be disappointed with the final outcome given they were minutes away from a valuable point, but they will justifiably feel they showed enough to believe they can progress from what is shaping up as a tight group.How Wednesday's Champions League action unfoldedGo straight to all the latest Liverpool news and viewsYou can now get Liverpool news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out more",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62879294

The 35-year-old made made five changes including dropping big-money summer signing Matthijs de Ligt to the bench following his foul to give away a late penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Stuttgart. He was replaced by French World Cup winner Hernandez, who made the first game-changing contribution.Nagelsmann's changes did not have the desired impact immediately, with Bayern regularly picked apart in a frenetic, end-to-end first half, struggling to find the final ball when they had possession in Barca territory.The Bayern manager introduced Leon Goretzka at half-time to try and establish control over the midfield and, while it was an old-fashioned set piece which provided the break through on 50 minutes, the second shortly after came through a superb move mixing teamwork and individual skill.First, an inswinging near-post corner from Joshua Kimmich was met by the head of Hernandez, escaping the marking of Marcos Alonso and beating goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to the ball.Four minutes later, patient build-up play from the back set up a driving run from midfield by Jamal Musiala. He then played in Sane who left Jules Kounde for dust before a cute chipped finish over Ter Stegen for a superb second.It was not all positive for Nagelsmann however - Sane reacted badly to being replaced with 10 minutes to go, throwing down his water bottle and storming from the bench.The artificial turf covered doors to the subterranean bench had to be opened for Sane to make his angry exit. The trap doors and pitfalls too remain a danger for Nagelsmann, despite this pressure-easing victory.All the reaction from Bayern Munich v Barcelona & Liverpool v Ajax",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62882374

346,Ajax 4-0 Rangers: Scots outclassed by rampant Dutch in Champions League,WED 07 Sept 2022,champions-league,"Edson Alvarez's free header started Ajax on the path to victoryRangers' celebrated Champions League return descended into a debacle as ruthless Ajax ran riot in Amsterdam.A nightmare first half obliterated hopes of a maiden win in the Dutch capital to mark the end of a 12-year absence from Europe's top tournament.Instead, the Europa League runners-up were outclassed thanks to goals from Edson Alvarez, Steven Berghuis, Mohammed Kudus and Steven Bergwijn.Borna Barisic's second-half strike was ruled out by VAR to top a grim night.The defeat is Rangers' second 4-0 defeat in the space of a week after their Old Firm slump at Celtic Park on Saturday.Podcast: 'Men against mannequins as Rangers collapseRangers must heed wake-up call to halt nightmare weekReaction & as it happenedOn the eve of battle, manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst did not flinch. The Dutchman fielded questions about potentially changing elements of his team after Saturday's Celtic drubbing. Most notably goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin.""You keep trusting your players and give them confidence because in the past we have bounced back from heavy defeats and that's what we have to do tomorrow as well,"" he said.But given that fewer than 24 hours later his team were 3-0 down at the break and his captain had been substituted, Van Bronckhorst could be forgiven for re-evaluating the situation.Even after making it to the Europa League final, graduating to the Champions League was always going to be a step up. Early on, Rangers were defensive but compact, tentative but tight enough. Then the floodgates opened on a torrid night.Just moments after a reticent Ryan Kent ducked out of a great counter-attack opportunity, the ball was in the Rangers net. A corner should have been dealt with. Instead Alvarez made a two-step move to evade a sleeping James Sands and head in.The waves of red and white attacks kept crashing against an increasingly nervous and sluggish Rangers defence. Devyne Rensch had one effort saved and watched another fly wide, before the second goal arrived just after the half hour.Berghuis found room on the edge of the Rangers box to shape up a shot. His effort looked as if it was going to be dealt with by the diving McLaughlin, only for a heavy Sands deflection to divert it away from the goalkeeper.Ajax's F-Side Ultras in the stands were still in full party mode when Kudus crashed in the third, but it was oh so easy. His close control and spin caught James Tavernier napping, with the Rangers captain failing to make a convincing job of stopping the Ghanaian galloping forward and skelping a thunderous shot across McLaughlin and in off the upright.Van Bronckhorst made three substitutes at half-time, including removing Tavernier, but it took until 20 minutes before the end before Rangers mustered much of a reaction. Kent's cutback for Barisic opened the defender up to arc a sumptuous strike into the far corner, but after a lengthy VAR check, it was clear Kent was a good few yards offside in the build-up. But the night would get even worse, Bergwijn pouncing on a ropey Ryan Jack backpass to round McLaughlin and finish.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62771409

Any hope of a second-half comeback were over when Zielinski chipped a finish over Alisson from close range to make it 4-0 and though Luis Diaz curled in for an immediate response and came close with a diving header, Liverpool were deservedly beaten. Deadline-day signing Arthur Melo came on for his debut late in the second half and fellow midfielder Thiago returned from injury to make a brief cameo, but Liverpool will head home having now won just two of their last seven matches in all competitions.

Napoli, though, needed only five minutes to take the lead when Zielinski coolly slotted in his penalty after handball against James Milner.A typical Klopp side would have been expected to bounce back immediately, but this season Liverpool have looked tired, demotivated and seriously out of form. What followed instead was only humiliation as the hosts were ruthless, while Liverpool made numerous mistakes and struggled to get a stronghold of the game with talisman Salah having several poor touches.Osimhen ran the struggling Gomez ragged and Napoli could have scored at least another two goals, were it not for a goalline clearance from Van Dijk to deny Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and a penalty save from Allison to thwart Osimhen after the lively frontman had been caught by Van Dijk.Former Fulham midfielder Anguissa doubled Napoli's lead in style as a quick one-two ripped apart Liverpool's defence, before Kvaratskhelia set up Simeone's third.When the whistle finally blew for the break, Klopp sprinted straight down the tunnel.The last time Liverpool conceded three goals in the first half of a Champions League game was in October 2014 when they lost 3-0 to Real Madrid.""That's an embarrassing 45 minutes,"" former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand said on BT Sport,Liverpool at least improved in the second half but Napoli remained in complete control.The impressive Zielinski added the fourth two minutes after the restart and Diaz's curling effort in the 49th minute was no consolation for the disappointing six-time European champions.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62815794

The Croatian champions have a woeful record in this competition - winning just five of 43 games before this meeting - but they stubbornly held on after taking a first-half lead.The dangerous Mislav Orsic netted the 13th-minute winner, running through from the halfway line and beautifully dinking a finish past the advancing Kepa Arrizabalaga.Dinamo came agonisingly close to a second but Stefan Ristovski's thunderous, long-range effort was superbly tipped on to the bar by Arrizabalaga.Deadline-day signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was handed his Chelsea debut and, although the ex-Arsenal skipper had a goal ruled out for offside, he largely looked off the pace.Armando Broja replaced Aubameyang just before the hour mark, but the Albanian had little impact in an overall disjointed performance from Thomas Tuchel's men.Chelsea launched a late onslaught on Dinamo's goal and the hosts were relieved to see Reece James' low shot rattle the foot of the post with five minutes remaining.In Group E's other game, Serie A champions AC Milan drew 1-1 against Austrian champions FC Salzburg.How Tuesday's Champions League action unfoldedGo straight to all the latest Chelsea news and analysis - in one placeYou can now get Chelsea news notifications in the BBC Sport app - find out moreTuchel's century ends on sour noteI am angry at myself and Chelsea performance - TuchelIn the first transfer window under their new owners, Chelsea were Europe's highest spending club with an outlay close to £300m on new signings this summer.The Blues, though, look an incoherent outfit and although Tuchel - who took charge of the side for the 100th time against Dinamo - is not yet under pressure, the German will quickly need to work out his side's problems with hands-on new owner Todd Boehly watching closely.A solid defensive platform was the bedrock of Tuchel's success in his first few months at the club, when he led them to their second Champions League title with victory over Manchester City.But in seven games in all competitions this term, the Londoners have already lost three times and kept just one clean sheet, which came on the opening day of the Premier League campaign against Everton.Former Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly is an experienced Champions League player, but defensive team-mate Wesley Fofana was making his first appearance in the competition.And the lack of understanding between the pair - who cost more than £100m between them - in the early days of their partnership was apparent for the goal when they both went for a high ball, yet neither got to it.It allowed Bruno Petkovic to flick the ball on for Orsic, who held off Fofana before advancing on goal and converting with the coolest of finishes.Arrizabalaga, who started instead of out-of-form number one Edouard Mendy, did not have much to do, but denied Ristovski with a stunning save.At the other end of the pitch, Aubameyang was given a first start since signing from Barcelona and the 33-year-old striker played in a face mask, having been involved in a violent robbery at his home which left him with a broken jaw.The signs were good when he ran through early on, but failed to pick out a team-mate with his cutback and struggled to make an impact thereafter.Chelsea's general showing was one of slow build-up play which did not do enough to unlock a well-organised and obdurate Dinamo backline.The visitors chased an equaliser with time running out, but Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic saved Mason Mount's first-time strike and Kai Havertz's header from six yards out was brilliantly blocked by Robert Ljubicic.It was just Chelsea's second group stage loss in 18 games, while Dinamo held on for a famous victory.The perfect start from the Croatians gives them hope of reaching the knockout stage of the Champions League for the first time, having failed to do so in all previous seven appearances in the competition.

From the throw-in, Liel Abada lashed just wide as the stadium roared its approval.It was not a flash in the pan either, with the Israeli winger set free in behind the defence after a wonderful pass from Jota, but his rushed shot went straight into Courtois' hands.And after McGregor rattled an upright from the edge of the area and half-time substitute Daizen Maeda scuffed a brilliant opportunity from six yards, there was a sense of foreboding that Celtic's missed chances would haunt them.Almost inevitably the five-time European champions Modric and Tony Kroos grew in influence and Real did punish Celtic's profligacy in a beautifully effective four minutes.A flowing move which started at the feet of Courtois ended with Vinicius planting Federico Valverde's cross in the bottom corner, before Hazard set up Modric to caress home at the second attempt.With Celtic suffering from their first-half exertions, Real controlled the ball with greater ease and put together a stunning 33-pass move which culminated in Kroos picking out Dani Carvajal, who stroked across goal for Hazard to tap home their third.Celtic kept fighting to the end and still looked a threat in flurries, but ultimately they were outclassed in the second-half by the 14-time kings of Europe, whose quality shone through.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62771360

And the visitors claimed a superb 4-1 win courtesy of further goals from the impressive 21-year-old Mykhaylo Mudryk and ex-Ajax forward Lassina Traore.In Group F's other game, champions Real Madrid overcame Celtic 3-0.But the night belonged to Shakhtar, who are unbeaten since their domestic league resumed last month following Russia's invasion in February.The club has been ravaged by war, unable to play at home since 2014 and seeing key players such as David Neres, Dodo and Marlon Solomon all departing this summer.In July, the club said they were demanding 50m euros (£43m) damages from Fifa for lost transfer fees after football's world governing body ruled that foreign players in the country could suspend their contracts following Russia's invasion.But they have defied all the odds and after their opening Champions League group game have already collected more points (3) and more goals (4) than they earned in the entirety of last season's group stages when they finished with two points and two goals.""I could not have imagined in my wildest dreams such a game with four goals for us,"" said captain Taras Stepanenko. ""But we played well and I feel we deserved that result tonight.""Yes, it is right I have been with the club for over a decade. This is a new team, but many of these young players are from the Shakhtar academy so they have the Shakhtar spirit and this really helps us a lot.""One of those youngsters is star forward Mudryk, who was reportedlyexternal-link chased by Premier League side Brentford during the summer, with a move failing to materialise as the £30m asking price was not met.And he showcased his potential on the biggest stage with a cool finish into the bottom corner, as well as providing two assists.Winger Shved, who made three appearances for Celtic in the 2019-20 campaign, signed last week for Shakhtar and had a dream Champions League debut with two goals.Meanwhile, Burkina Faso international Traore spent nine months out of action after suffering a knee injury in this competition last September.He is the only foreign player remaining at the club from before Russia's invasion and wrote on Instagram last week it ""doesn't feel right"" leaving as he ""always felt supported by everyone at Shakhtar"" during his rehabilitation.Traore came off the bench to net his side's fourth goal and round off an unforgettable night.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62815725

He added to his tally after the break when he was again on hand to score from close range after home goalkeeper Yassine Bounou parried Phil Foden's shot into his path. In between, England midfielder Foden had given City a healthy cushion in their Group G opener, teasing his marker Nemanja Gudelj before sweeping a left-foot effort into the bottom-right corner of the net. Ruben Dias underlined the gulf in class between the Premier League champions and the side that finished fourth in La Liga last term late on, side-footing Joao Cancelo's cross into the middle of an empty net. ""When they were playing better we scored the second one with a brilliant action from Phil [Foden]. Then after it was easier - we gave more passes,"" City manager Pep Guardiola told BT Sport.""Sometimes we want to rush so quick because Erling is there. You have this attraction of him, we want to attack it sometimes. We have to be more patient. I think his numbers across his career, not just here, is quite similar.""So he has an incredible sense of goal. We have incredible numbers in scoring goals, so we want to continue like that.""The manner of City's victory and final scoreline was not unduly flattering, with the visitors dominant throughout.Julen Lopetegui's side looked short of attacking ideas and bereft of confidence after their winless start to the La Liga season. With John Stones and Kyle Walker missing because of minor injuries Guardiola handed a debut to Switzerland defender Manuel Akanji, but aside from a wild first-half effort from Alejandro Gomez, the hosts barely threatened. The comprehensive win sends City top of their group, with Borussia Dortmund second on goal difference after beating FC Copenhagen 3-0 in their opening match.Reaction from all Tuesday's Champions League actionHaaland's incredible start continuesCity's only previous trip to the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium came almost seven years ago when Wilfried Bony scored in comfortable 3-1 win. This performance was even more assured, with Guardiola's side monopolising possession against their hosts who offered little threat to counter. Predictably Haaland, who is seen by many as the man who can be the final piece of the jigsaw as City chase European glory, came to the fore again. The forward maintained his incredible start to his City career as he knocked in goals 11 and 12 from his eight appearances for the club. Neither were remarkable, but both owed to his exceptional ability to read the game and anticipate the cross from De Bruyne, as well as Bounou's mistake. Both his finishes were from no more than eight yards out, again underlining his capacity to operate with clinical efficiency from a limited number of touches (19), and they contributed to City's biggest ever win against Spanish opposition.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62800316

But it was their European muscle memory which got Giovanni van Bronckhorst's team over the line, as they again proved a smart, skilful and gutsy team on the big stage, traits which characterised their run to last season's Europa League final. Now, the club and its fans can look forward to testing themselves on the biggest stage.Man of the match - James SandsThe 22-year-old American came of age in Eindhoven. His reading of the game was outstanding, making six clearances and two interceptionsTriumph in tough circumstances - analysisRangers have impressed regularly in Europe in the past four seasons, and this performance underlines the belief and confidence in the group as they triumphed despite trying circumstances.Van Bronckhorst made a huge call to leave out Morelos and travel with just one recognised striker in Colak, and their preparations were disrupted further before kick-of when their bus was held up by PSV fans. Then there was the fact their away record in Europe read just one win in 11. But away from Ibrox and in a rowdy arena, they still produced the goods. It wasn't the swashbuckling football they showed on their run to Seville last season, but they were disciplined, rode their luck, and delivered big moments when it mattered.Tillman's reading of the game was crucial, and McLaughlin's brilliant save from Gakpo kept them ahead. With Celtic already assured of their place in the group stage, it was vitally important for the club financially to keep pace and qualify.The manager has to take huge credit for his influence on the team, having now guided them to six wins from six in two-legged European knockout ties. His calm authority and tactical nous have stood out particularly in cup competitions.Almost exactly 10 years ago Rangers were held to a draw by Berwick Rangers in the third division, this caps the journey back. The league title two seasons ago was crucial, but now they can truly say they have returned to the top level.What's next?Ross County are the visitors to Ibrox in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday (15:00 BST), but before that they can enjoy Thursday's group stage draw, which takes place at 17:00.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62635235
359,Rangers 2-2 PSV Eindhoven: All square after breathless play-off first leg,TUE 16 Aug 2022,champions-league,"Antonio Colak's excellent goal hauled Rangers level before half-timeRangers' hopes of ending their 12-year absence from the Champions League group stage are on a knife-edge after an enthralling draw with PSV Eindhoven.The Ibrox side fell behind to Ibrahim Sangare's thumping finish, only to hit back swiftly with Antonio Colak's well-crafted equaliser.Goalkeeper Walter Benitez's howler, spilling a Tom Lawrence free-kick, gifted the hosts a second-half lead.But they were denied a comeback win by Armando Obispo's 78th-minute header.Slick PSV then almost snatched victory in a breathless contest, with Jon McLaughlin making a sprawling save from Philipp Max.The sides meet again in the play-off second leg next Wednesday in Eindhoven to decide who progresses to the lucrative group stage.Reaction & as it happenedVan Bronckhorst backs RangersRangers had fed off the intensity of a febrile Ibrox to burn past Union St-Gilloise in the previous round, overcoming a two-goal first-leg deficit for the first time in their history, but talent-laden PSV were a serious step up in quality.They had Rangers on the ropes for much of the second half as Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side struggled to match the electric home performances of last season's run to the Europa League final.It's the Champions League top table where Rangers now long to be and they travel to the Netherlands with their dream very much intact having posed PSV's vulnerable defence problems.Ruud van Nistelrooy - a long-time friend and former Netherlands team-mate of Van Bronckhorst - has begun his managerial career with his PSV team delivering a glut of goals this season.They wasted little time in showing their threat as Luku de Jong slipped between static defenders to clip a lovely delivery from Ismael Saibari narrowly over. The offside flag had been raised, yet the warning was clear.Malik Tillman, deployed just off lone striker Colak, tried to get Rangers going, sending a drive skidding straight at Benitez then jinking towards the six-yard box before a heavy touch spoiled his build-up work.Rangers were screaming for a penalty moments later but their appeals yielded nothing further than a VAR check after Connor Goldson's header hit the outstretched upper arm of Jordan Teze.PSV continued to look a menace on the counter-attack and after Rangers survived a let-off at a corner, with Tillman slicing an attempted clearance into McLaughlin's arms, the Dutch made their next one count.The impressive Cody Gakpo's delivery wasn't dealt with by Rangers and when Teze got a toe to the loose ball to tee up Sangare, the midfielder applied a thumping finish. Rangers' response was rapid and emphatic. Steven Davis' splendid pass sprung James Tavernier down the right and the full-back's cutback was expertly swept first time into the far corner by Colak for the striker's fourth goal in four games. The goal galvanised Rangers and Tavernier sent a header into Benitez's arms then Colak had a near-post effort parried away by Benitez.The momentum was soon punctured, though, as PSV began to assert dominance. Ibrox held its collective breath when a simple move cut the hosts open. De Jong's flick-on from a long ball was seized upon by Saibari, whose poked shot ruffled the side-netting on its way past.Saibari was in the thick of things, rifling a shot too high before darting into the box and forcing a low stop from McLaughlin.Rangers were hanging in there, and their grit was rewarded with a goal out of nowhere. There looked little danger when Lawrence's free-kick from 30 yards out bobbled towards Benitez, only for the keeper to inexplicably let the ball wriggle out of his grasp and trickle over the line.PSV did not let the howler prey on their minds, and struck back when Obispo rose to meet a corner and divert his header in off the bar.Man of the match - Cody Gakpo The Netherlands winger provided an assist for PSV's equaliser and was a threat throughout, showing the quality that has seen linked with Manchester UnitedRangers undone by set-piece frailtiesVan Bronckhorst will be concerned that Rangers twice - avoidably - conceded from corners.PSV possess plenty of height, but their opener was a scruffy affair stemming from a routine delivery that should have been dealt with, while Obispo was afforded too much space for the second. Rangers must provide sterner resistance next week.The hosts also found themselves stretched in midfield at times, with Gakpo and Saibari offering pace and width and PSV not afraid to go direct.Yet while only operating at their peak in bursts, van Bronckhorst's men showed resolve to secure a draw and trouble a defence that has conceded in all six games this season.Colak continues to grow in stature as the Ibrox side's striking figurehead, with the Croatia international having netted for the fourth game running. His link-up play and finishing prowess will be crucial in the decider.Tillman and Lawrence also offered glimpses of inspiration and Rangers will head to Eindhoven confident they can create the chances to progress to the Champions League promised land where a £30m-plus windfall awaits.What did they say?Rangers boss Giovanni van Bronckhorst: ""We gave everything. At moments we played really well against a quality side. The differences in 90 minutes weren't that big.""Happy with the performance, we could have had a better result but also worse. So everything to play for next week.""PSV Eindhoven manager Ruud van Nistelrooy told BT Sport: ""First half Rangers were the better team, we struggled. The fans were behind them and we had to go through a difficult phase.""The better of the chances were for us in the second half and 2-2 is a fair result.""What's next?Rangers have a Scottish Premiership trip to face Hibernian on Saturday (12:30 BST) before their Champions League fate will be decided in the second leg with PSV next Wednesday (20:00).",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62548886
360,Rangers 3-0 Union Saint-Gilloise (agg 3-2): Scots stun Belgian visitors to make play-offs,TUE 09 Aug 2022,champions-league,"James Tavernier scored his 16th European goal for RangersRangers roared into the Champions League play-offs after they overcame Union Saint-Gilloise and a two-goal first-leg defeat in a rousing showing.The hosts had it all to do after losing in Belgium, but goals from James Tavernier, Antonio Colak and Malik Tillman gave Giovanni van Bronckhorst's side a spirited victory at Ibrox. While blunt in the first leg, Rangers were by far the better team in Glasgow against a Union side who had Lazare Amani sent off late on.Tavernier's penalty and Colak's close-range header set up a tense finale, before Tillman's fantastic 79th-minute header put Rangers ahead in the tie for the very first time during a strong second half.They will now face PSV Eindhoven in the play-offs as they bid to return to the group stage for the first time since 2010.It is the first time Rangers have ever overcome a 2-0 first-leg deficit to progress in Europe.Reaction and as it happenedThe hosts started well, as they did in Belgium seven days ago. The Ibrox atmosphere, which Rangers have come to rely upon on such nights, seemed to have shaken the opposition. That is no slight on Union - many bigger European teams have also wilted under that pressure.Colak headed just over early on before he had another effort tipped above the bar by Anthony Moris. Set-pieces were Rangers' strength in the first half, but they were unable to unlock a stubborn Union defence in open play.That was until Siebe van der Heyden stretched an arm to block a looping cross in the box, and Tavernier did what Tavernier does - slotting from the spot on the stroke of half-time. His 16th goal in European competition for Rangers, and one that was timed to perfection.The second just before the hour brought Ibrox to its feet in a scene of hysteria. Getting on the end of a Tillman flick, Tavernier ghosted in behind to square. The ball fell to Scott Arfield who forced a fantastic save from Moris, but Colak showed predatory instincts to nod in from a yard out and level the tie.From there, it felt inevitable that Rangers would find a third. John Lundstram went close when Tom Lawrence teed him up, but Moris produced a flying save to deny the midfielder.There was a moment of doubt when James Sands appeared to be heading down the tunnel early after clearing a poor pass from John McLaughlin - but referee Tasos Sidiropoulos changed his mind after consulting the far side assistant.That was the kick Rangers needed and soon they would be ahead. Borna Barisic's hanging cross looked destined for Moris' arms, but Tillman produced an acrobatic leap to steal in front of the keeper and nod into an empty net.Union midfielder Amani was then sent off in the dying seconds as the game raged frantically, with Rangers advancing after a breathtaking two legs.Man of the Match - Malik TillmanSuperb throughout the night, the American looks to be the jewel of Van Bronckhorst's summer signingsRangers rely on Ibrox atmosphere to grind down Union's willEven trailing by two goals, plenty of Rangers fans headed to Ibrox confident of a result. They had witnessed enough European evening evidence in the last year to calm their nerves.Proved right, there were still moments throughout the night that would have tested their resolve. Union, as they did in the first leg, waited to pounce but their attacking potency had almost evaporated.So instead of a disaster, this will be remembered as a scare. But PSV, their next opponents, will not be as forgiving. However, with Ibrox able to rouse such spirited performances from this Rangers team, the club's supporters will be dreaming of another memorable season in Europe.What they saidRangers manager Giovanni van Bronckhorst: ""I'm really pleased we're still in contention to go to the group stage. I think we made this tie very difficult because of the first performance and we needed a huge performance today.""We know what went wrong last Tuesday but we need two games like we delivered today to have a chance to go through [against PSV].""""We kept a clean sheet and just created as many chances as possible. This game needed a big performance and the players gave a big performance""What's next?Rangers host St Johnstone on Saturday (15:00 BST) as they look to maintain their 100% record in the league so far.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62460304
361,Champions League third round qualifying: Union Saint-Gilloise 2-0 Rangers,TUE 02 Aug 2022,champions-league,"Union Saint-Gilloise's Teddy Teuma scored to make it 1-0 in the first halfRangers' Champions League hopes are in the balance after they slipped to a meek defeat by Union Saint-Gilloise.The visitors' positive start evaporated when Teddy Teuma was allowed too much space in the box to fire the opener.Then, after a VAR check deemed Connor Goldson had handled in the box, Dante Vanzeir rolled in a second-half penalty to double the Belgian side's lead.It leaves Rangers with it all to do in the second leg of the third qualifying round tie at Ibrox next Tuesday.Their deficit could have been higher had it not been for a vital block from goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin to deny Vanzeir when he was through one-on-one, while James Tavernier cleared a header off the line in added time.Antonio Colak had passed up a glorious chance to equalise at 1-0, but Rangers were a shadow of the side that reached the Europa League final last season.The winner of the tie will face Monaco or PSV Eindhoven for a place in the group stage, with those sides drawing 1-1 in the first leg in France.Reaction & how it happenedRangers had settled quickly and tested Anthony Moris twice in the early stages through a Borna Barisic free-kick and long-range drive from James Sands.However, that was the sum total of the home goalkeeper's work in the opening period.Union began to find their rhythm and poise midway through the half, and gave Rangers fair warning of what was to come when Simon Adingra drove down the left and put the ball on a plate for Vanzeir only for Sands to pop up with a crucial intervention.That warning was not heeded, however, as Teuma smashed the ball under McLaughlin via a slight deflection a minute later after Barisic had knocked the ball into his path.It could have been two before the break, but Tavernier intervened to deny Adingra a tap-in.Glimpses of the Union goal were infrequent for Rangers, though Colak could have been forgiven for expecting a team-mate to get on the end of the ball he smashed across the six-yard box.Shortly afterwards came the penalty award and although Rangers felt the VAR-assisted award was harsh, Vanzeir was unperturbed as he rolled it past McLaughlin.Fortunately for Rangers, McLaughlin was able to get something on the forward's breakaway effort a few minutes later or the tie could be all but over.Man of the match - Teddy TeumaQuite apart from his fabulous strike, Teddy Teuma's (left) all-action performance caught the eyeVan Bronckhorst's tactical tweak backfiresGiovanni van Bronckhorst has shown a willingness to adapt his tactics, particularly away from home in Europe, and that flexibility has largely served him and Rangers well.Playing Sands and John Lundstram either side of Connor Goldson mirrored Union's own defensive set-up and appeared to be designed to allow Rangers to build play from the back, and freeing Barisic and Tavernier a little further up the park.However, the home side employed an extra man in the middle of the park, outnumbering Glen Kamara and Ryan Jack.That told, as Union used their stranglehold of the engine room to help dominate play, choking Rangers' attacking ambition.What's next?Rangers are at home in the Scottish Premiership to Kilmarnock on Saturday (15:00 BST), before welcoming Union Saint-Gilloise to Ibrox in the second leg of this tie on Tuesday (19:45).Line-upsLive TextLine-upsUnion Saint-GilloiseFormation  3-5-249Moris26Sykes16Burgess44Van der Heyden2Nieuwkoop20Lynen17Teuma8Amani94Lapoussin11Adingra13Vanzeir49Moris26Sykes16Burgess44Van der Heyden2Nieuwkoop20LynenBooked at 80mins17TeumaSubstituted forPuertasat 90+2'minutes8Amani94Lapoussin11AdingraSubstituted forZianiat 85'minutes13VanzeirSubstituted forFrançoisat 90+2'minutesSubstitutes3Boone6El Azzouzi14Imbrechts19François21Pirard23Puertas24Ziani28Machida35Huygevelde85DonyRangersFormation  4-5-133McLaughlin2Tavernier6Goldson19Sands31Barisic17Matondo18Kamara4Lundstram8Jack71Tillman9Colak33McLaughlin2Tavernier6GoldsonBooked at 74mins19SandsBooked at 39mins31BarisicSubstituted forYilmazat 67'minutes17MatondoSubstituted forLawrenceat 77'minutesBooked at 90mins18Kamara4Lundstram8JackSubstituted forDaviesat 67'minutesBooked at 79mins71TillmanSubstituted forWrightat 77'minutes9ColakSubstitutes1McGregor3Yilmaz10Davis11Lawrence23Wright26Davies28McCrorie30Sakala37Arfield38King44DevineReferee:Irfan PeljtoAttendance:1,100Live Text Post updateMatch ends, Union Saint-Gilloise 2, Rangers 0.90'+5'Full TimeSecond Half ends, Union Saint-Gilloise 2, Rangers 0.90'+2'SubstitutionSubstitution, Union Saint-Gilloise.

362,Champions League: Ten-man Linfield bow out after heavy defeat by Bodo/Glimt,WED 27 Jul 2022,champions-league,"Amahl Pellegrino scored twice for Bodo/Glimt, the first a brilliant curling right-footed effortTen-man Linfield bowed out of the Champions League as they were thrashed by Bodo/Glimt in the second leg of their second-round qualifier in Norway. After Linfield's 1-0 win last week, Hugo Vetlesen's early opener levelled the tie for the hosts. Victor Boniface doubled the lead on the night from the spot after Kirk Millar was sent off for handball. Amahl Pellegrino (2), Ulrik Saltnes, Runar Espejord (2) and Alfons Sampsted wrapped up an emphatic win for Bodo.Bodo will play Lithuania's FK Zalgiris Vilnius in the third round of qualifying while Linfield drop into the third qualifying stage of the Europa League, where they will face FC Zurich.Millar was the Linfield hero last week with his exquisite late lob giving the four-in-a-row Irish Premiership champions a slender advantage heading into Wednesday's return leg.However, the experienced winger's night in Norway ended prematurely when he was dismissed for stopping Vetlesen's goal-bound effort after 21 minutes.With Vetlesen having already given Bodo the lead on the night, Boniface's spot-kick left David Healy's side with a mountain to climb.Linfield were forced to play most of the game with 10 men following Millar's 21st-minute dismissalBut the hosts refused to relent and put another two past Linfield keeper Chris Johns before half-time with Pellegrino curling a superb shot into the corner before captain Saltnes stretched to connect with a Sampsted cross. The Norwegians made three substitutions at the break but that did not disrupt their rhythm as they continued to lay siege to the Linfield goal, with substitute Espejord netting a fifth from close range after Johns had kept out Elias Hagen's shot. Pellegrino notched his second from the spot after Ben Hall's foul on Anders Konradsen before Sampsted finished off a slick Bodo/Glimt move with 17 minutes from time On 88, Linfield's miserable evening was complete when Espejord struck for the second time to cap a hugely impressive showing from the home side. Linfield must now regroup in time for Europa League qualifying in which they face FC Zurich, who lost their Champions League qualifier to Azerbaijan side Qarabag after extra-time on Wednesday.

363,Champions League qualifier: Linfield fight back to secure dramatic extra-time win over TNS,WED 13 Jul 2022,champions-league,"Mulgrew's thunderbolt took the game into extra-timeJamie Mulgrew hit a stunning long-range goal as Linfield secured a dramatic extra-time win over The New Saints to move through to the Champions League second qualifying round. Substitute Ethan Devine scored the crucial second goal early in extra-time to give them a 2-0 win at Windsor Park and a 2-1 aggregate victory.The visitors were on the verge of progressing thanks to their 1-0 first-leg win when Linfield captain Mulgrew, on as a sub, found the top corner from 25 yards to force extra time.    Irish Premiership champions Linfield will now play FK Bodo/Glimt of Norway in the second qualifying round, after the Norwegians defeated KI Klaksvík. Welsh champions TNS, meanwhile, drop into the Europa Conference League qualifying second round and will play Iceland's Vikingur.To add further to the drama on Wednesday night in Belfast, experienced skipper Mulgrew was a late addition to the Linfield bench not long before kick-off.The 34-year-old produced a moment of real quality and one of the club's best-ever European goals when he controlled the ball well from 25 yards out and hammered an unstoppable right-foot shot that flew straight into the top corner. The aggregate winning goal then came four minutes into extra time, courtesy of fine work from full-back Matthew Clarke, who started the night as captain, and sub striker Chris McKee.Clarke made an excellent tackle deep in his own half before progressing with the ball and playing it into the channel, with McKee sprinting at full speed to keep it in and deliver a low left-wing cross which youngster Devine slid in to stab home from close range.   The former Cliftonville and Knockbreda striker, signed by Healy in January, came close to equalising two minutes before Mulgrew's leveller but his header from a lovely Kirk Millar cross came back off the crossbar.The Blues had goalkeeper Chris Johns to thank for keeping the second-leg score at 0-0 when, nine minutes after the interval, he made a superb save from a Declan McManus downward header, with Clarke later making a fine block to deny the TNS forward.Cooper looks lively before late injury Cooper was full of running for Linfield at WindsorOne worrying moment for Linfield came in the closing stages of extra time when Joel Cooper went off with what looked like a hamstring injury.He was one of their best players on the night, particularly during their bright start to the game. He beat two men and delivered a cross early on that just evaded Daniel Finlayson, before Chris Shields fired off target from long range after being teed up by Stephen Fallon.Full-back Finlayson had the best opportunity of the half on 19 minutes when he met an inviting Fallon cross from the left, but his header under pressure was superbly saved by Connor Roberts down low to his left.The pace of the game began to drop after the opening half hour and visiting keeper Roberts was booked for time-wasting from a goal-kick before Millar fired well wide for the hosts. Danny Davies had the only effort of note for the Welsh champions, who won the first leg through a Ryan Brobbel goal, six minutes from the interval when he chopped inside well before firing too close to Chris Johns.At the other end three minutes later, Robbie McDaid stooped to meet a delicious Shields cross with a diving header that had power but was saved by Roberts to ensure the sides went in level at the break.

365,Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid: Reds beaten in Paris as Vinicius Jr hits winner,SAT 28 May 2022,champions-league,"Real Madrid are champions of Europe for a record 14th timeLiverpool's bid to claim the Champions League trophy for the seventh time ended in bitter disappointment as Vinicius Jr's second-half winner gave Real Madrid victory in Paris.  Jurgen Klopp's side ran into a one-man wall of defiance as Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois produced one of the great individual performances to thwart Liverpool time and again. Mohamed Salah, seeking revenge for his early departure through injury in the 2018 final against Real, was denied six times by Courtois who was simply unbeatable.The victory also sees Carlo Ancelotti make history by becoming the first coach to win a fourth Champions League title.Real were always a threat and the decisive moment came after 59 minutes when Vinicius stole in unmarked at the far post to score. This was also a final marred by chaotic scenes outside Stade de France with thousands of Liverpool fans, some targeted with pepper spray by French police, unable to get into the stadium, forcing the kick-off to be delayed by more than 30 minutes. 'A miserable night on every level imaginable'Liverpool want investigation into final scenesFrom embarrassment to glory - 'remarkable' RealOrganisation of final 'a shambles' - RobertsonLiverpool fall at final hurdleChampions League: Liverpool will 'go again' says Jurgen KloppLiverpool's magnificent season brought them the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup - both won on penalties against Chelsea - but ended in a double disappointment in the final week of a stellar campaign.The Champions League might have eased the agony of just missing out on the Premier League to Manchester City by one point, only for Liverpool to find themselves on the wrong end of a goalkeeping masterclass from Courtois. The Belgian was simply perfect as he was a constant thorn in Salah's side, turned Sadio Mane's shot on to the post brilliantly and commanded his penalty area with faultless handling. Salah held his head in disbelief on many occasions as Courtois manned the barricade for Real, leaving the Egyptian to nurse the pain of another Champions League final defeat by the Spanish giants. Liverpool will come again after final loss - KloppI don't get enough respect says Real's CourtoisChampions League final: Real Madrid beat Liverpool - recapGo straight to all the best Liverpool contentMohamed Salah was denied several times by Thibaut CourtoisLiverpool were not quite at their best and eventually paid the price for not taking chances as Real pounced in trademark fashion to win this tournament for a record-extending 14th time. Klopp's side could not have given any more as they pushed to the final whistle but looked jaded towards the end - no surprise given the demands made of them this season. Liverpool will still take huge credit by maintaining a push for an historic quadruple until the final week of the season but the conclusion will sting. The occasion left even more of a sour taste given the events outside Stade de France. Liverpool are demanding a full investigation into how thousands of their fans could not get into the stadium, with dangerous numbers packed into small areas as kick-off approached. Real Madrid kings of Europe againReal Madrid have been living by the skin of their teeth in the Champions League this season, but any side that beats Paris St- Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool to reach their goal answers every question. This is a side that knows how to get the job done, no matter how late they leave it, no matter how much the odds seem stacked against them. Real are bolstered by years of experience and quality that gives them concrete-clad self-belief that has seen them navigate their way out of so many tight situations. And what a moment for their legendary coach Ancelotti, who was brought back to the Bernabeu from Everton a year ago and has won La Liga and the Champions League on his return. Ancelotti can now lay claim to history with that fourth triumph, once again showing his mastery of managing egos and high-class players who respond to the vastly experienced Italian's promptings. He was the most relaxed man in Paris at his pre-match press conference, oozing confidence, and can now look back at two Champions League wins over Liverpool, here and for AC Milan in 2007, after losing in the so-called miracle of Istanbul in 2005. Ancelotti is one of the greats and has proved it again. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61609200
366,Real Madrid 3-1 Manchester City (6-5 agg): Real come back to reach Champions League final,WED 04 May 2022,champions-league,"Only Cristiano Ronaldo (450) and Raul (323) have scored more goals for Real Madrid than Karim Benzema (322)Manchester City suffered one of the most remarkable Champions League collapses as Real Madrid came back from the abyss to set up a final showdown with Liverpool.City were two goals ahead on aggregate going into the 90th minute after Riyad Mahrez's strike had added to their 4-3 first-leg win last week.And then Rodrygo happened.The Brazilian substitute turned home Karim Benzema's left-wing ball from close range in the final minute - with Real's very first shot on target.And 90 seconds later he levelled the tie with a header into the top corner after Marco Asensio flicked on Dani Carvajal's cross.That sent an already rowdy Bernabeu into absolute euphoria.City, who thought they were going through to a second consecutive all-English Champions League final, were shell-shocked.We were so close - GuardiolaBoth sides had chances to win the tie before the full-time whistle. Ederson denied Rodrygo a quick-fire hat-trick and then an unmarked Phil Foden fired over inside the box.And so to extra time the game went - and it was Real who got the decisive goal in maybe the greatest Champions League semi-final ever.Benzema beat Ruben Dias to a loose ball in the box and was brought down by the City defender. He stepped up to take the penalty himself and scored his 43rd goal of the season. There is no doubt it is the most important.Real's Thibaut Courtois, who was by far the busier keeper, tipped away Foden's header with Fernandinho inches away from scoring the rebound - but City could not find a goal to send it to penalties.That sets up a repeat of the most memorable Champions League final of recent years, when Real beat Liverpool 3-1 in 2018.For City and manager Pep Guardiola now, the Premier League title - they sit one point above Liverpool with four games to go - is their only target.Man City must 'process' semi-final defeat - GuardiolaFootball Daily podcast: Man City's Champions League Real-ity checkFollow reaction to the game hereCity's devastating blowPep Guardiola has lost six Champions League semi-finals, a joint record with Jose MourinhoThe Champions League has delivered so many classic knockout ties in recent years, including the first leg of this one - a match City should have won by more.It was looking like a rare, and delightfully, mundane one for City after Mahrez hammered home following Bernardo Silva's surging run.City have five Premier League titles - and are four wins away from a sixth - since the Abu Dhabi takeover in 2008.But the Champions League - the trophy that really establishes your place as an icon of world football - has always eluded them.After last season's 1-0 loss to Chelsea in Porto, they may have wondered how long they would have to wait for another crack. It looked like the answer was only 12 months. But now, who knows? City fans will curse Rodrygo's name forever if they never manage to win the European Cup.The truth is City should have won this game easily. In the first half, Real keeper Courtois denied Mahrez, Kevin de Bruyne, Silva and Foden.Late on Jack Grealish had a shot cleared off the line by Ferland Mendy - and another effort kept out by a diving Courtois. Ederson's only save in normal time came to deny Rodrygo a hat-trick.After Benzema's goal, they rarely looked like coming back and their players stood emotionless as the final whistle went on their European dreams.Now Guardiola has a huge task on his hands. He has to lift City's players' heads for their final four Premier League games. If they lose any of them, that gives Liverpool the chance to overtake them and win the title - and possibly become the first English team to win the quadruple.Another night of European glory for Real Rodrygo is the fourth player to score multiple goals in the 90th minute or later of a Champions League matchReal are the ultimate European Cup team, having won the competition 13 times - six times more than anybody else.But in the final minute not even they could have imagined they would be going to Paris later this month.So many times this season they were on the brink. They came back from 2-0 down on aggregate to beat Paris St-Germain in the last 16.Then in the quarter-final against Chelsea, Rodrygo sent it to extra time with a late goal and Benzema netted the winner. Sound familiar?Rodrygo, who replaced Toni Kroos after 68 minutes here, has truly booked his place in Real folklore now.Carlo Ancelotti's side wrapped up the La Liga title last weekend and can now focus all their attention on that game with Liverpool.Their last final meeting, in 2018 in Kyiv, saw Gareth Bale score twice and Loris Karius' howler gift Benzema a goal in a classic.Rodrygo is the third substitute to score multiple goals for Real Madrid in a Champions League match. Bale that day was one of the other two.Anybody else excited to see what Real and Liverpool dish up on 28 May in this competition that never, ever stops delivering?",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61312216
367,Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (2-5 on aggregate): Jurgen Klopp's side advance to Champions League final,TUE 03 May 2022,champions-league,"Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool: Mentality monsters were in town - KloppLiverpool survived a scare against Villarreal to move into the Champions League final - and keep their hopes of winning an unprecedented quadruple alive.The Reds had comfortably won 2-0 in the first leg but that advantage was wiped out after only 41 minutes at a noisy and passionate El Madrigal as the Spanish side pushed for a huge upset.Boulaye Dia scored Villarreal's first after only three minutes, converting Etienne Capoue's pass, before ex-Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin headed in a second from another Capoue cross as the Reds looked rattled.Liverpool had to improve in the second half and Fabinho put them back in front on aggregate with a shot that went through the legs of Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli in the 62nd minute.Luis Diaz, whose introduction at half time changed the game after he replaced Diogo Jota, restored Liverpool's two-goal aggregate advantage with a header at the back post.Sadio Mane secured Liverpool's place in their third Champions League final in five seasons with a third goal after taking the ball around Rulli. Villarreal ended the game with 10 men with Capoue sent off late on for two bookable offences.The Reds will play either Manchester City or Real Madrid at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May.No English side has ever won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup all in the same season, with Liverpool aiming to create history.The Football News Show: Is Liverpool's Luis Diaz the signing of the season?Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayerVillarreal v Liverpool as it happened, plus reaction and analysisGo straight to all the best Liverpool contentLiverpool suffer, but get the job doneVillarreal's performance in their 2-0 loss at Anfield led one English radio pundit to call the Spanish side a ""disgrace"" and ""pathetic"", despite an incredible run that had seen them eliminate former winners Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous two rounds.However, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp knew the tie was not over and warned his side they ""would have to be prepared to suffer"" in the second leg.And suffer they did in arguably Liverpool's worst half of football this season, with passes misplaced, errors made and the side looking uncharacteristically vulnerable.They made the worst possible start, conceding after only three minutes.Pervis Estupinan, who scored an own goal at Anfield, provided a cross which was pulled back by Capoue and Dia, inside the six-yard box, reacted quickest to convert from close range.Villarreal needed to win the Champions League to qualify for next season's tournamentDani Parejo shot just wide and Gerard Moreno had an effort blocked before Villarreal, seventh in La Liga and managed by ex-Arsenal boss Unai Emery, made it 2-2 on aggregate thanks to Coquelin's fine header.Liverpool had to improve in the second half, and Trent Alexander-Arnold's shot hit the crossbar after taking a huge deflection off Coquelin.But the breakthrough came with Fabinho's strike and that led to a capitulation from Villarreal, who conceded three times in a 12-minute spell. Diaz headed in Alexander-Arnold's cross to give the visitors some breathing space before a rash decision from Rulli saw him sprint off the line with Mane getting there first and finishing into an unguarded goal.This is the 10th time Liverpool have reached the final of the European Cup or Champions League as they aim to become European champions for a seventh time after successes in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019.Liverpool keep quadruple hopes aliveLiverpool's progress keeps them on course to become the first English side to complete the quadruple.They already have the Carabao Cup in the trophy cabinet after beating Chelsea on penalties in February and Thomas Tuchel's side are again the opposition at Wembley for the FA Cup final on 14 May.This victory means Liverpool have become the first English club to reach the final of the European Cup/Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup in the same season.Liverpool are also only one point behind Manchester City in the Premier League title race and could meet in the Champions League final later this month.Sadio Mane scored in both legs of the Champions League semi-final to help Liverpool reach the finalPep Guardiola's side hold the advantage in the second semi-final after an incredible first leg at Etihad Stadium saw them beat Real 4-3 in one of the best games in the tournament's history.The second leg takes place at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium on Wednesday and if the Spanish champions, managed by ex-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti, can turn the one-goal deficit around it would set up a repeat of the 2018 final.Real won 3-1 on that occasion as Gareth Bale scored twice, including an incredible overhead kick, but the game will largely be remembered for two goalkeeping errors from Liverpool's Loris Karius.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61300681
368,Liverpool 2-0 Villarreal: Jurgen Klopp's Reds take control of Champions League semi,WED 27 Apr 2022,champions-league,"Sadio Mane has scored 14 Champions League knockout goals, equalling Didier Drogba's record for African playersLiverpool took a giant stride towards another Champions League final with a commanding victory over Villarreal at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp's quadruple-chasing Reds had to demonstrate patience to break down a Villarreal side well organised by European specialist Unai Emery. Liverpool were held at bay despite creating all the chances and needed a touch of fortune to break the deadlock after 53 minutes when Jordan Henderson's cross was deflected beyond Villarreal keeper Geronimo Rulli by Pervis Estupinan. Sadio Mane increased Liverpool's control when he touched Mohamed Salah's pass beyond Rulli two minutes later.The second leg in Villarreal is still to come next Tuesday but Liverpool now look firmly on course to meet either Manchester City or Real Madrid in the final in Paris in May.Premier League has two of modern era's greatest sidesReaction to Liverpool's first-leg winLiverpool rumble onLiverpool 2-0 Villarreal: Jurgen Klopp 'loved' first-leg goalsLiverpool just seem to be gathering unstoppable momentum as all challenges, even from a Villarreal side that claimed the scalps of Juventus and Bayern Munich in the previous rounds, are overcome. Villarreal set out to take the sting out of the home team from the first whistle, taking an age over goal-kicks and other restarts, but unlike the frustration that overtook them at times against Everton at Anfield on Sunday, Liverpool remained composed, seemingly safe in their knowledge that their chance would come. And so it proved as they moved through the gears at the start of the second half, a change of tempo that proved too much for Villarreal, with Fabinho having a goal disallowed even before Henderson's attempted cross took that crucial touch off Estupinan. Klopp was able to remove the tireless Henderson and goalscorer Mane from the fray as Liverpool remained in control. Liverpool possess such threat that it is almost impossible for a team to simply sit out and hope to keep them away, such is the array of attacking riches now at Klopp's disposal. It is a collection of such power that he was able to keep Diogo Jota on the bench until that two-goal cushion was established, such has been the stunning impact of January signing Luis Diaz. Diaz gave an electrifying performance, with two first-half shots that were simply too powerful for Rulli to hold, while his change of pace troubled Villarreal all night. Klopp and Liverpool will take nothing for granted but such is their form and confidence, it is hard to see how even a side as durable as Villarreal can haul this back. Liverpool now turn their attentions back to the Premier League pursuit of Manchester City when they travel to in-form Newcastle United on Saturday (12:30 BST). The historic quadruple is still on and the celebrations at the final whistle here suggested the Kop believes that what most observers thought was impossible is now a genuine possibility. Emery still holds out hopeEmery's body language and impassioned gestures in the closing moments, enraged when Villarreal players conceded possession, suggested he thinks his side are still in this Champions League semi-final despite a two-goal deficit. He has every right to hold out hope with his stellar record in these two-leg formats, having won the Europa League four times with Sevilla and Villarreal and defied the odds to take 'the Yellow Submarine' into the last four of the Champions League. It will surely require something spectacular, even for this European expert, for Villarreal to disrupt a side of Liverpool's stature. Villarreal were drilled to the last detail in defence but they were not given any opportunity to launch the devastating counter-attacks that did such damage to Juventus and Bayern Munich. Emery can never be discounted but Villarreal did not show enough here to suggest they can stop Liverpool reaching their third Champions League final under Jurgen Klopp. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61233604
369,Manchester City 4-3 Real Madrid: Pep Guardiola's side win thrilling Champions League semi-final first leg,TUE 26 Apr 2022,champions-league,"Kevin De Bruyne scored and assisted in the same Champions League game for only the second time in 59 appearances in the competition, after doing so against Real Madrid in February 2020Manchester City will take a slender Champions League semi-final advantage to the Bernabeu after winning a seven-goal first-leg classic against Real Madrid at Etihad Stadium. City delivered a magnificent display as they peppered Real's goal for long periods but Carlo Ancelotti's side kept rising off the canvas to somehow keep themselves in serious contention to reach another final. Kevin de Bruyne set the tone for a magical night of football with a diving header from Riyad Mahrez's cross in the second minute and in-form Gabriel Jesus quickly added a second from close range as Real reeled under wave after wave of attacks. Mahrez enraged manager Pep Guardiola when he hit the side-netting instead of finding the unmarked Phil Foden, who shot inches wide before Karim Benzema, inevitably, gave Real a lifeline by sweeping home Ferland Mendy's cross after 33 minutes. The Spanish side escaped again shortly after the break when Mahrez struck the post but City restored their two-goal advantage when an unmarked Foden headed home Fernandinho's cross in the 53rd minute. City were pegged back again when Vinicius Junior dummied past Fernandinho and ran from inside his own half to score a superb second for Real.However, a brilliant use of advantage from referee Istvan Kovacs allowed Bernardo Silva to fire into the top-left corner for City's fourth. There was still no let-up and Benzema capped a spectacular game by showing nerves of steel to chip a Panenka penalty past Ederson with eight minutes left following Aymeric Laporte's handball. Liverpool face Spanish side Villarreal in this year's other semi-final, with the first leg at Anfield on Wednesday.The final will be held at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday, 28 May.Manchester City v Real Madrid as it happened, plus reaction and analysisFootball Daily podcast: A Real Mad night in ManchesterWho made your combined Man City & Real Madrid XI?Go straight to all the best City contentMan City 4-3 Real Madrid: Result could have been better - GuardiolaWill Manchester City feel frustrated?City would have taken any sort of advantage to Spain before kick-off but deep down they will know their almost total dominance of Real should have given them much more than this narrow lead for the second leg. Guardiola's side were simply irresistible for spells and could have been four goals ahead before Benzema struck Real's first, the manager clearly infuriated by Mahrez's selfishness in shooting with Foden standing unmarked in front of goal at 2-0. Guardiola and his players will take heart from the manner in which they carved Real open so often and they will hope to capitalise on their opponents' need to press for a goal in Spain. Bernardo Silva and Phil Foden both scored for Manchester City in the second halfDe Bruyne was outstanding once more and Foden just showed how at home he is on the elite stage, but City have to be concerned at how they looked defensively vulnerable on occasion to leave Real very much alive in this semi-final. A side of City's calibre will be confident of progress - but most observers will know this tie should already be over. Benzema the talisman for Real Real will always have hope when they have Benzema, the 34-year-old Frenchman who deserves his place in the upper echelons of the great strikers in world football. It is often a mystery how Real survive when looking punch drunk having come back from losing situations to beat Paris St-Germain and Chelsea in their previous knockout ties.But a comeback looked beyond them when they were blown away by a blistering City opening that left them two down after only 11 minutes. And yet, for all their struggles elsewhere, the La Liga leaders carry an air of menace that means concentration levels cannot drop for a moment. They proved it again as they dusted themselves down to give themselves a lifeline. It was no surprise that Benzema was the man responsible, showing all of his class with a left-foot volley past Ederson to make it 2-1. Brazilian youngster Vinicius Junior also produced magic for the second goal before Benzema's nerveless penalty. The great survivors are still in this tie and will now hope the magic of the Bernabeu can inspire them once more next week under coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is trying to win the trophy for a fourth time. Karim Benzema's 'Panenka' penalty was his 41st goal of the season for Real. He is the first player to score 40 goals in a single season for Real Madrid since Cristiano Ronaldo in 2017-18",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61221249

They included a potential headbutt from former City centre-back Stefan Savic on Raheem Sterling - and hair pull on Jack Grealish - during an unsavoury melee involving both sets of players and the two benches after Felipe's foul on Foden.Clashes also continued at full-time as both sets of players made their way down the tunnel.Prior to this, the 90 minutes had showcased a different approach from the Spanish champions in comparison to a first leg in which they operated largely in a 5-5-0 formation and failed to muster a single effort on goal.Roared on by a vociferous home crowd, they pressed fiercely, harrying the City players all over the pitch.Having stayed in the tie for three quarters of it - with Geoffrey Kondogbia's blocked 35th-minute effort their solitary shot across both legs - the hosts came out swinging for the second period.Antoine Griezmann went close, as did Rodrigo de Paul, Matheus Cunha and Luis Suarez, as boss Diego Simeone threw every attacking option he had onto the field in the hope of breaking the visitors down.But this is not an easily intimidated City side, nor does their elite attacking prowess come at the expense of defensive frailty, even when injury affected Kevin de Bruyne and Kyle Walker and forced the introduction of Nathan Ake.John Stones was immense, with a block to deny a Cunha effort from close range the highlight of an intelligent and dogged display.Keeper Ederson was also called upon for a heroic moment, saving superbly to stop Angel Correa's shot after the ball had broken to the Atletico man in the box in the 11th minute of added time.Celebrations were mixed among the confrontations at full-time, but City have little time to rest after this epic energy-sapping encounter.Saturday sees them face Liverpool in the FA Cup semi and, two weeks from now, Real will visit the Etihad.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086835

I know Bayern Munich don't want to hear that.""The semi-final brings Liverpool face-to-face with Villarreal boss Unai Emery, who has won the Europa League four times.Three of those triumphs came at Sevilla, including victory over Klopp's Liverpool in the 2016 final, and the other with his current club.Klopp added: ""The manager is the king of the cup competitions, so they are experienced and a team full of desire and well organised with top-class players.""Reaction from Liverpool-Benfica & Atletico Madrid-Man CityWhere does Liverpool's quadruple bid stand?All the best Liverpool content hereReds still in quadruple huntThe games are coming thick and fast for Liverpool at the business end of the campaign, with a huge FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City up next on Saturday - the second meeting between the Premier League's top two in a week.They head for Wembley knowing they are one round away from a third Champions League final in five seasons under Klopp.The Liverpool boss made seven changes to the side that started the first leg in Portugal last week, with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane among those on the bench.There was a return for James Milner who, at the age of 36, became the oldest Englishman to start a Champions League match since 37-year-old David Beckham did so for Paris St-Germain in 2012-13.The Reds were made to work hard for their place in the semi-finals as Benfica came out fighting but the damage was done in the first leg.""I made seven changes and that makes life not easy for the players,"" added Klopp. ""We lost concentration when we were 3-1 up and it looked like we were through.""It was not exactly what we wanted but it is absolutely not important.""If we played the best game of the season tonight, it wouldn't have made it more likely to get to the final. We are through and that's all that matters and I'm really happy.""After Saturday, Liverpool - who trail leaders Manchester City by a single point - have a chance to return to the top of the Premier League, for 24 hours at least, when they host Manchester United in the Premier League the following Tuesday.It will require a monumental effort for Liverpool, who won the Carabao Cup in February, to finish the season with four trophies and they will certainly have to defend better than they did in this game.But with just a few weeks of the season left, they remain in the hunt for what would be an incredible feat.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61083788
372,Bayern Munich 1-1 Villarreal (1-2 agg): Spanish side stun Bayern with late Chukwueze winner,TUE 12 Apr 2022,champions-league,"Villarreal had two shots on target over both legs and scored two goalsSamuel Chukwueze scored a late winner in the tie as Villarreal stunned Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 16 years.Unai Emery masterminded a 1-0 first-leg win in Spain, but a dominant Bayern looked seemingly in control once Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute at the Allianz Arena.But, with just his side's second shot on target across both legs, Chukwueze levelled on the break in the 88th minute to give Villarreal the lead on aggregate - and earn them an historic victory against the six-time European champions.They will face the winner of Liverpool versus Benfica in the last four, a contest Jurgen Klopp's side currently lead 3-1 on aggregate. ""It's an extraordinary feeling, it was not easy for us,"" said Emery. ""We are moving forward step by step, we had a quarter-final, very difficult, but our goal before this game was not to give a good image of us, it was to qualify.""To achieve something, you have to do important things and beat the favourites. That [round of 16] game against Juventus gave us a lot of confidence.""In the semi-finals, we will try to create circumstances so that we have our chances. Liverpool are a great team and Benfica too. It will be a great semi-final to enjoy.""Tuesday's Champions League reactionClinical Yellow Submarine pull off masterclassEtienne Capoue was among a number of ex-Premier League players to feature for VillarrealFormer Arsenal boss Emery has pedigree in European football, winning the Europa League twice with Sevilla as well as with Villarreal last season.His side had already dumped out Juventus in the Champions League this time around, but few gave the Yellow Submarine a chance against a Bayern outfit that are nine points clear in the Bundesliga and chasing a 10th successive title.Villarreal, meanwhile, sit seventh in La Liga, but Emery has moulded them to thrive under the lights on big European nights, pulling off another defensive masterclass and ruthlessly dispatching Bayern on the break.Julian Nagelsmann sent out an uber-attacking line-up and what followed was a bombardment of pressure from the home side, albeit without creating any clear-cut chances in the first half.Flying wingers Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman contributed to Bayern's 18 crosses before the break, but that approach became predictable and Jamal Musiala's tame header was straight at keeper Geronimo Rulli. Villarreal were not happy to simply sit on their lead, however, with Gerard Moreno proving a threat for the visitors at either end of the half, while Arnaut Danjuma, matchwinner in the first leg, fired off target.Bayern's first opportunity after the interval fell to Dayot Upamecano, who side-footed over the crossbar from Sane's cut-back, before Lewandowski took it upon himself to pull Bayern level.The 33-year-old, booked for a foul on Raul Albiol and perhaps fortunate to avoid a second caution for catching the defender again moments later, swivelled smartly from Thomas Muller's pass and squeezed a low effort into the corner off the post.It was his 13th Champions League goal of the season and Villarreal became the 30th team Lewandowski has scored against in the competition, with only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Karim Benzema and Raul netting against as many. Muller then headed over and with every missed Bayern chance - and 45 shots mustered over the two legs - Villarreal became more confident they could snatch a goal on the break. With two minutes of normal time remaining, they did so in clinical fashion.Dani Parejo showed composure to start a move that was worked swiftly and superbly up field for Moreno to cross for Nigerian international Chukwueze to finish at the back post, just three minutes after coming on as a substitute.""In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie and all the comments serve as motivation for us,"" said Moreno, after Villarreal reached the semi-finals for the first time since they lost to Arsenal in the 2005-06 campaign.""They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great, we deserved to go through. We knew we were going to suffer in defence, but we were going to have our chances and, in the end, Chukwueze was able to make the most of it.""Villarreal reached the Champions League semi-final for the first time since 2005-06, when they lost to Arsenal",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61086842

374,Chelsea 1-3 Real Madrid: Benzema hat-trick puts Spaniards in charge in Champions League last eight,WED 06 Apr 2022,champions-league,"Karim Benzema's hat-trick was his second in successive Champions League games after a treble against Paris St-Germain in the last 16Chelsea's hold on the Champions League hangs precariously after Karim Benzema's hat-trick put Real Madrid in a position of power following the quarter-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti made a winning return to the club where he won the Premier League and FA Cup double after veteran France striker Benzema delivered his latest masterclass. Benzema, 34 and fresh from the treble that sunk Paris St-Germain in the last 16, punished holders Chelsea with two magnificent headers in the space of three minutes midway through the first half. Kai Havertz's header gave Chelsea hope before the break but keeper Edouard Mendy's poor clearance seconds after the restart gifted Benzema his third to put Real in command of the tie before the second leg at the Bernabeu next Tuesday (12 April).Follow reaction from Real Madrid's win over ChelseaChelsea punished heavily for errorsChelsea battled to the end of this first leg but were always fighting an uphill task after they were hit by Benzema's brilliant one-two and then saw their hopes of mounting a comeback wrecked by a self-inflicted wound. Real had already delivered a warning about the danger they posed when Vinicius Junior hit the bar but that went unheeded as he provided the cross for Benzema's flying headed opener. And once Benzema had confirmed his aerial threat with a second, Chelsea were always vulnerable against a side who are the masters of these Champions League situations. Karim Benzema became the fourth player to score back-to-back Champions League hat-tricks after Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Luiz AdrianoHavertz, the match-winner in last season's Champions League final win against Manchester City, gave a subdued Stamford Bridge some hope but the entire destiny of the tie may have turned in the opening 40 seconds after the interval. Mendy, normally so reliable, made an expensive misjudgement when he raced from goal only to send a weak pass in the direction of Antonio Rudiger. The defender was unable to gain control and the predatory Benzema was in like a flash to roll the ball into the unguarded net with Mendy looking on in anguish. It came just after Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel had introduced Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech at the start of the second half to build on Havertz's goal, but the changes were undermined before they had any chance to take effect. Tuchel later brought on Romelu Lukaku in a desperate attempt to retrieve the situation but his struggles were summed up when he sent a weak header wide with one of Chelsea's best chances of the night. Chelsea have demonstrated an ability to overcome adversity in the past but with Real holding a two-goal advantage going into the second leg at the Bernabeu, it would rank as one of their finest achievements if they were to reach the last four from this position. Tuchel says Chelsea have to find their level againMadrid the masters once moreReal Madrid may be runaway leaders in La Liga but Carlo Ancelotti's side were regarded as rank outsiders as they chase a 14th triumph in this competition in its guises as the European Cup and Champions League. Yet, after the dramatic comeback against the odds to knock out Paris St-Germain in the last 16, with this show of experience and class at Stamford Bridge they demonstrated once again that their credentials are dismissed at your peril.And in Ancelotti, for all the speculation surrounding his long-term future at the Bernabeu, they have a leader who has demonstrated his expertise by winning this trophy three times with AC Milan and Real. The coach and Real's players showed they are old hands at this and how they punished Chelsea, with Benzema and the 36-year-old Croatia maestro Luka Modric at their heart, to take a giant stride towards the semi-final. Benzema gets better with age, scoring two headers of the highest class before poaching a third goal, while Modric retains that priceless ability to control the tempo of games, retain possession and always make the right choice from the options available. Ancelotti will take nothing for granted but the veteran Italian, who flew into London on the day of the game after recovering from Covid-19, cut a highly satisfied figure at the final whistle.

Luis Diaz scored late on to put Klopp's side in control of the encounter but they could have been out of sight were it not for a number of fine saves from Benfica goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos.Ibrahima Konate rose highest to head the visitors into the lead from a corner before Sadio Mane added a clinical second to dampen the mood at a lively Estadio da Luz in a dominant first half.The home fans ramped up the noise again shortly after the interval when Konate's mistake allowed sought-after striker Darwin Nunez to pull one back for the Portuguese outfit and make it a contest. But the Premier League side will have a healthy advantage when they welcome Benfica in the second leg next Wednesday after Diaz added a late third with a composed finish after rounding Vlachodimos, who also denied Diogo Jota in the final moments.""Coming here and winning an away game in the Champions League is tough. Obviously, Benfica fought for their lives,"" said Klopp.""We could have scored in the last minute - the fourth one would be nice but we're not in dreamland here.""It's half-time, we know much more about our opponent, they will go for it again. They won at Ajax, they ground out all the results out in the group stage that they needed, so we are aware of the quality and now we have a nice game in between and then we will be ready again for Benfica.""Reaction to Tuesday's Champions League action'We will fight' - title race intensifies as rival bosses focus on big matchPerfect start to tough run for LiverpoolBig compliments to Benfica but we should have scored more - KloppThis was a near perfect start to a mammoth run of games for Liverpool that will define their season, with the return leg sandwiched between Sunday's game at Premier League leaders Manchester City and an FA Cup semi-final against Pep Guardiola's side six days later.The Reds are chasing a historic quadruple and have already won the Carabao Cup this year, despite Klopp saying four trophies is not a realistic target and insisting winning just one other competition this term would be ""outstanding"". Their progress in Europe now looks set but it was not comfortable for the visitors until Diaz skipped round goalkeeper Vlachodimos to score his side's third with three minutes to go. Diaz, jeered throughout because of his history with Benfica's domestic rivals Porto, was making his first Liverpool start in the competition but continued his seamless beginning to life with Klopp's side and proved a threat throughout. He had earlier been denied by Vlachodimos, who stopped Mohamed Salah adding a third before the break as well as keeping out Jota late in the second half. Liverpool were completely in control early on and were already threatening before Konate was left unmarked to head in Andrew Robertson's corner to score his first goal for the club.The visitors then ruthlessly punished a poor touch from former Tottenham and QPR midfielder Adel Taarabt, as Trent Alexander-Arnold angled a superb ball into Diaz and the forward cushioned a header into Mane's path to give him a simple finish. Benfica, who upset an in-form Ajax side in the previous round, responded four minutes into the second half when Konate missed his kick from Rafa Silva's low cross and 22-year-old Uruguay forward Nunez showed why he is so in demand with a composed finish from close range for his fifth goal in the competition this season. That gave the home side belief and, buoyed by the intense atmosphere their fans created, Benfica suddenly looked a different team as Everton tested Alisson from range and Nunez failed to convert after breaking in behind the defence, instead going down under pressure from Virgil van Dijk only to see his penalty appeal waved away.But it was Diaz who stole the show late on and Klopp's attention will now switch to a huge game against City in the race for the Premier League title.

Diego Simeone's side performed with their trademark defensive discipline, restricting City to very few opportunities until De Bruyne pounced to make the breakthrough with 20 minutes left. Phil Foden, on as a substitute, produced the moment of magic to unlock Atletico with a perfect pass through the legs of Reinildo for De Bruyne to slot past goalkeeper Jan Oblak. It was the decisive moment in the tightest of games but City manager Pep Guardiola's wild celebration illustrated just how much it means to take a lead, even if slender, to Madrid for the second leg on 13 April. Champions League - Man City & Liverpool win first legs'Man City get their hands dirty to edge Atletico''We will fight' - title race intensifies as rival bosses focus on big match'It was like Foden was in a playground'Foden introduction sparks CityDifficult game, tough opponent - Guardiola on Manchester City's 1-0 win over Atletico MadridIt was clear from the opening moments this was going to be a night for patience from City as Atletico, to no-one's great surprise, strung a bank of five defenders across the pitch and invited Guardiola's side to break them down. For the first 45 minutes it worked to perfection as the hosts barely laid a glove on the Spanish champions, who protected keeper Oblak with the diligence and desire Simeone demands. It was actually Atletico who threatened with a couple of breaks early in the second half, but City eventually managed to impose themselves and become more of a threat. De Bruyne saw a free-kick well saved by Oblak and Aymeric Laporte headed over from a good position following a corner.But it was the introduction of Foden that finally allowed City to spread some stardust on proceedings. He showed glorious control and vision to nutmeg Reinildo, allowing De Bruyne to fire low past Oblak to ignite what had been a tense, largely subdued atmosphere inside Etihad Stadium. City could not add a second with De Bruyne denied by a block on the line from Stefan Savic, but any lead is precious against an Atletico side who have made a speciality of frustrating Premier League giants in the past.Liverpool found that out in 2020 when they lost both legs as holders in the last 16, while Manchester United were also eliminated at the same stage this season. ""We played an incredible top side who are difficult to face, but it is a good result,"" said Guardiola.""We had chances to score a second and third. It is not easy to face a team with a lot of experience in this tournament. We will go there to score and try to win again.""Simeone marched off in defiant fashion at the final whistle and the Argentine will rightly feel Atletico are still in this tie - it would be folly to dismiss Simeone or his durable Champions League campaigners. The onus though, is now on them to attack in the return leg. ""It is a bad result because we lost 1-0 and we were looking to win,"" Simeone said. ""It is clear we were playing against an extraordinary opponent. The numbers and statistics speak for themselves and they play in a very dynamic way. We had to suffer but we have to go to Madrid now and use the tools we have at our disposal.""We need to be better but we are still in the tie. Let's see if we can have the ball more in the second leg and create more difficulties for our opponents but that comes with being calm and having the collective defensive effort.""However, alterations to Atletico's approach may well suit City more than having to break down the red and white wall of resistance that made their lives so difficult until that important De Bruyne strike on his 50th Champions League appearance for the club.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60988011

Tuchel's side will find out their last-eight opponents in Friday's draw.  ""I want us to be the team nobody wants to play,"" said Tuchel. ""That's the role we see ourselves in this last round of eight.""It's a big step to do it again and again - and that is why we fight for top-four places in maybe the toughest league in the world and we fight now again in the top eight teams [in Europe].""This brings out the very best in us.""Reaction to Wednesday's Champions League actionBlues through despite off-field issuesIt was something of a passive performance from the Blues as Lille harried and pressed with intent, though the Premier League outfit were able to maintain control and show their quality when needed.Developments regarding the club's ownership continued to play out during the game as it was announced Lord Coe has joined a consortium led by ex-Liverpool chairman Sir Martin Broughton to buy the club, while former Chelsea striker Gianluca Vialli said he is working with Nick Candy on his bid.Earlier the Ricketts family, who own Major League Baseball team the Chicago Cubs, confirmed they are leading a group of investors which will make an offer by Friday's deadline.Whether those off-field matters were a distraction or not, it was Lille who got a deserved 38th-minute opener following a bright start in which they made life uncomfortable for Chelsea.Yilmaz placed his spot-kick in the top corner after Jorginho handled, with referee Davide Massa awarding the penalty after being told to view the pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee.But to Chelsea's credit they responded quickly and Jorginho made amends with a neat pass into Pulisic, who finished from a tight angle to dampen Lille's renewed hope. Xeka did head against the post for the hosts in the second half, but when Azpilicueta guided Mason Mount's whipped ball in with his knee, the tie was over. Chelsea will now wait to see what happens off the field, with Uefa also saying on Wednesday it was seeking clarification from the European Union on future Champions League matches involving the Blues after sanctions were imposed on Russian owner Roman Abramovich.Abramovich, who is understood to have strong ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, has had his assets frozen by the UK government and Chelsea have had to obtain a special licence to continue operating. That has brought with it spending caps, though the club's players and staff were able to fly to Lille for the game because those arrangements were already made prior to the sanctions. Meanwhile, the Three logo was displayed on Chelsea's changed yellow strip during the fixture despite the company saying it has requested the club finds a solution to remove it.So while it may not have been a vintage performance, boss Tuchel will be pleased his side kept their focus and still have a chance to add to last season's Champions League triumph.

It is the fifth successive season City have reached the quarter-finals, while Guardiola has managed a team to this stage for a record-equalling 12th time.""I'm a guy who learns at the time to enjoy the moment. When I qualify for the quarter-finals, I enjoy it; when I qualify for the last 16, I know how difficult it is,"" said Guardiola, who led Barcelona to two Champions League titles as their manager.""When you go through, every opponent is difficult. Now it is time to congratulate everyone, focus on the Premier League and see the draw.""City's stunning 5-0 win in last month's first leg in Lisbon had already effectively settled this tie, and it was clear from the outset that the Portuguese side did not entertain any hope of an unlikely comeback.Sporting packed their defence, perhaps wary of suffering another damaging defeat, leaving Guardiola's side in total control of possession but struggling to carve out meaningful chances.Raheem Sterling wasted City's best opportunity before the break when he ran on to Phil Foden's pass and tried to dink the ball over Antonio Adan but did not get enough height on his shot.Gabriel Jesus did find the net for the home side at the start of the second half but a VAR review ruled he was offside from Riyad Mahrez's pass and the goal was disallowed.Despite being unable to make the breakthrough, City remained completely comfortable and Guardiola was relaxed enough to bring on third-choice keeper Scott Carson for Ederson with 20 minutes remaining.The 36-year-old, making his first appearance of the season, was quickly called into action to deny Paulinho from close range, bringing chants of 'England's number one' from the delighted City fans.City will find out their quarter-final opponents on 18 March and Guardiola said it was a ""good sign"" that expectations have risen for the club. ""The last decade, step by step, the club grew and for many years we were there in the Champions League and qualifying for the last 16,"" he added. ""Now, again, we're in the quarter-finals and among the best eight teams in Europe.""Go straight to all the best Man City contentReaction from Etihad Stadium and Wednesday's other Champions League actionMan City lack sparkle but still keep controlIt's an honour to be among the last eight teams in Europe - GuardiolaThis was the first time since the end of October that City had failed to score at home but, while this performance lacked the sparkle of their win in Lisbon, they never loosened their grip on the tie.Sporting did manage some efforts at goal before the end but in the early stages they barely got a kick, and seemed content to try to keep City quiet.Until Sterling ran clear before half-time, there had been precious little goalmouth action at either end but the home fans, still chanting noisily about Sunday's thumping derby win over Manchester United, did not seem to care too much.City's lack of fit or available defenders had been a cause for concern for Guardiola before kick-off but Sporting's lack of ambition meant he had little to worry about on the night, and teenage defender Conrad Egan-Riley acquitted himself well on his debut at this level.So too did veteran midfielder Fernandinho, who was making his 100th Champions League appearance, and seemed to relish his recall to the starting line-up.There are much tougher tests to come for City this season, starting with their trip to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday, but they made effortless progress here.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60666631
382,Real Madrid 3-1 Paris St-Germain (3-2 agg): Karim Benzema hat-trick inspires superb Real fightback,WED 09 Mar 2022,champions-league,"Karim Benzema is the first player from France to score three Champions League/European Cup hat-tricksKarim Benzema scored a superb second-half hat-trick as Real Madrid produced a stirring fightback at a raucous Bernabeu to reach the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Paris St-Germain. Kylian Mbappe's first-half goal had given PSG a deserved two-goal aggregate lead and looked to have put Mauricio Pochettino's side well on course for the last eight. However, a mistake by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma proved the catalyst for a dramatic recovery with Benzema turning home after the Italian dawdled in possession. Luka Modric's driving run and intricate pass made Benzema's second as he levelled the tie against a clearly panicked PSG, and as the visitors attempted to regroup the 34-year-old drove a low effort into the bottom right corner seconds after the restart to settle the tie.Is Benzema the best number nine in the world?Until Donnarumma's error PSG had been in complete control. Marco Verratti was slick and dominant in midfield, while Neymar and Lionel Messi worked themselves into some dangerous positions as the hosts struggled to contain their more fluent opponents.Mbappe in particular was electric, racing on to a pass from Neymar to open the scoring against the side he has been heavily tipped to join in the summer when his contract at PSG expires.Either side of that the 23-year-old tormented the Real defence, twice having goals correctly disallowed for offside but showing his predatory instincts nonetheless.A surge of acceleration also saw him burst past Real's Eder Militao and only a brilliant covering challenge from David Alaba prevented him from adding to his tally. Mbappe's influence was such that he received warm applause from the home support as he got up after appearing to be hurt in a tackle, but the real damage to his and PSG's long-standing aspirations in the competition were still to come.

And alarmingly the Argentine and his stunned players were unable to provide any adequate response once the tide had turned in this contest. Julian Draxler and Angel di Maria were only introduced once the Parisiens were chasing the game, and aside from a late Messi free-kick which dipped just over, they were unable to conjure a single clear-cut goalscoring opportunity as they meekly exited the tournament.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60666638
383,Bayern Munich 7-1 FC Red Bull Salzburg (8-2 agg): Hosts thrash Austrians to advance into last eight,TUE 08 Mar 2022,champions-league,"Only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have scored more goals for a single team in the Champions League than Robert LewandowskiRobert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick inside the opening 23 minutes as Bayern Munich thrashed Red Bull Salzburg to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.The Poland captain, on his 100th start in the competition, confidently stroked home two penalties inside 21 minutes, after twice being recklessly brought down by Salzburg defender Maximilian Wober, the second confirmed after a VAR review.The first spot-kick, swept into the bottom-left corner, was Lewandowski's 40th goal of the season in all competitions.He added his third after chasing down an attempted clearance from visiting goalkeeper Philipp Kohn to tap in from close range. It is the first time a Champions League hat-trick has been completed as early as the 23rd minute, although it is not the quickest treble in the competition, with that record held by Bafetimbi Gomis following his three goals in eight minutes for Lyon in a 7-1 win over Dinamo Zagreb in 2011.Bayern's quick start put them firmly in control of a game that had been billed as ""all or nothing"" by some in the Bavarian media after the six-time winners were held to a disappointing 1-1 draw in the first leg in Austria.Matthias Jaissle's Salzburg had early chances with Nicolas Capaldo and Nicolas Seiwald both guilty of failing to convert glorious opportunities. They were made to pay for their profligacy by the deadly Lewandowski before another mistake in defence allowed Serge Gnabry to add a fourth with a low shot that squirmed under Kohn, while Thomas Muller thumped in a fifth after the break. On an otherwise bleak night for the visitors Maurits Kjaergaard did at least mange a consolation with a powerful effort into the top-left corner. But that only seemed to stir Julian Nagelsmann's team back into life, with Muller finishing off a well-worked move for number six before Leroy Sane thumped home late on.Relive Tuesday's Champions League actionLewandowski masterclass inspires BayernMuch had been made of Bayern's defensive vulnerabilities after they only scraped a late draw in the first leg, and Salzburg appeared to have real hope of becoming the first Austrian team to reach the last eight of this competition since 1985.But when it came to it they simply had no answer to a masterclass at the Allianz Arena, with Lewandowski the catalyst for a simple yet ruthless night's work by the hosts. The 33-year-old twice outfoxed Wober to set the tone for the second leg and his third - as he reached 85 Champions League goals in three fewer matches than Lionel Messi and 17 before Cristiano Ronaldo - was all about his determination to keep going. After Ronaldo (seven) and Messi (five), Lewandowski is now only the third player to score 10 or more goals in three or more different Champions League campaigns.And not content to rest on his laurels after becoming the top scorer in this season's competition, Lewandowski was also involved in Muller's second before teeing up Sane for Bayern's seventh of the night.

""I still hate it, but if there was any game we could have afforded to lose it was this one because the main target of this competition is to get through.""It's not that I am over the moon - I'm really happy we went through, because when we saw the draw it was 'OK, that's a tough one'. But we went through over two legs and I think we deserved it.""It's a big 'if' but if we had used our chances from set-pieces and other situations - it was a bit slapstick how we missed the chances - in the end we could still have won the game.""But the only thing I'm interested in is that it is fair we are through.""Reaction from Anfield and Tuesday's Champions League gamesGo straight to all the best Liverpool contentMartinez gave Alisson no chance with an arrowed finish from 20 yards in the 61st minute.But Inter's hopes of forcing extra time with a second goal faded when former Arsenal and Manchester United forward Alexis Sanchez was sent off just two minutes later for a second yellow card.Liverpool hit the woodwork three times in a bad-tempered game which, in addition to Sanchez's red card, saw six other players booked.After Joel Matip headed against the bar, Salah struck the post twice in front of the Kop. The draw for the last eight takes place on 18 March in Nyon, Switzerland.The game was also stopped for a few minutes in the first half due to a medical emergency in the crowd.Relief as Reds progressThere was a sense of relief around Anfield at full-time after Liverpool suffered a scare before booking their place in the last eight.The Reds were far from their best, but looked in control of the tie until Martinez's excellent strike, and Sanchez's dismissal then gave the hosts fresh momentum.A first defeat of 2022, after a terrific run in which they have delivered a trophy with the EFL Cup, will serve as a reminder to Klopp that there is still work to do if they are to end the season with more success.Having scored 109 goals in their previous 43 games, this was a rare occasion they failed to find the net.Liverpool did everything but score, though, as they rattled the bar and post, while substitute Luis Diaz was denied at point-blank range in the dying stages by Arturo Vidal's block.One positive for Klopp was the performance of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who seems to get better and better the longer the season goes on.He was at the heart of all his side's best moves and went close to scoring from a free-kick at the end of the first half.First home defeat for a yearThis defeat came almost a year to the day since Liverpool's last defeat at Anfield.Mario Lemina scored the only goal to give relegation-threatened Fulham a surprise away win on 7 March 2021.Liverpool had gone 28 games unbeaten at home - winning 21 and drawing seven - before Inter's first victory over the Reds since 1965.Despite the loss, Klopp's men have now reached the Champions League quarter-final stage for the fourth time in the last five seasons.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60651560

That was dreamland for the Leicester-born Daggers skipper, who was facing the prospect of meeting the 2016 Premier League winners, who lifted the FA Cup at Wembley little more than 18 months ago.But it took Gillingham just 12 minutes to level from Ben Reeves' superb left-foot inswinging right-wing corner when Indonesian defender Baggott outmuscled and outjumped flat-footed visiting keeper Elliot Justham to powerfully head his third goal in six home games.Ehmer headed home Alex MacDonald's outswinging right wing corner for his first goal since January on 77 minutes for what looked like the winner.Hakeeb Adelakun's late winner was the on-loan Lincoln City's man's first goal for GillinghamAnd within two minutes, Dagenham were reduced to 10 men when Phipps was given a straight red card for a clumsy high challenge on Lewis Walker.But the non-league side were not finished and, when Ehmer's weak header back to his goalkeeper Jake Turner fell short - Saunders latched on to the opening and despite being forced wide, slid the ball home from a tight angle.The game looked set for extra time - and even the prospect of penalties - when substitute Kashket got clear down the left, squared across and Adelakun powered home a fierce left-foot finish.Who's next?It leaves the Gills, 23rd in League Two, with the prospect of two meetings with Premier League clubs, starting with Wolves in the League Cup on 20 December before the Leicester game in early January - but first up is Sunday lunchtime's home game with a former Premier League outfit, Bradford City.Gills appealed fans to stay behind after the game to help get covers on the pitch quickly before the frost set in, in the hope Sunday's match will go ahead.Daryl McMahon's Dagenham, 12th in National League and four points from the play-off places, are next in action next Tuesday when they host Eastleigh. Gillingham boss Neil Harris told BBC Radio Kent:""Cup football is all about getting through to the next round - and now we can look forward to having Leicester live on TV here in January. And the winning goal was worthy of the reward of playing a Premier League side.""I'm pleased for the supporters. And it should give everyone confidence scoring three goals in a game - but now we need to back it up on Sunday against Bradford.""We just have to be more consistent. And, once we start doing that, then we will start winning games of football. It's a snowball effect.""The reason we're so good in the cups is that you can get away with the odd mistake over 90 minutes, but you can't do that in the league.""Dagenham & Redbridge boss Daryl McMahon:""It's the cruellest, cruellest way to lose a game. But the players gave it everything and you have to give them credit for that. ""I don't want to say the wrong thing right now. We are a bit emotional at the minute with how the game went and how it panned out for us.""You feel hard done by after all the hard work we put into it.""We have to pick the bones out of this one and move forward.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63848819
386,Stockport County 3-1 Charlton Athletic: Will Collar hat-trick sends County into third round,WED 07 Dec 2022,fa-cup,"FA Cup: Will Collar hat-trick sends Stockport into third roundWill Collar's hat-trick for League Two Stockport County knocked out managerless League One side Charlton Athletic in their FA Cup second-round replay.Charlton, who sacked Ben Garner on Monday, took an early lead when County keeper Ben Hinchliffe flapped at a corner and the ball bounced in off his own defender Akil Wright.Stockport began to take control of the tie with Collar side-footing an equaliser as County spurned a number of good first-half efforts. Ryan Rydel's free-kick hit the Charlton post early in the second half before Collar blasted home his second from eight yards out before converting a penalty soon after.County will host fellow League Two side Walsall in the third round on Sunday, 8 January.The game was a first in charge for Addicks caretaker boss Anthony Hayes and the Irishman made seven changes to the side that lost 1-0 at Cheltenham in the league on Friday. But for large parts Charlton were second best against opponents from the division below as they failed to win for a seventh successive game in all competitions.Despite an unchanged side from the one that won 5-0 at Hartlepool on Saturday, Stockport found themselves a goal down from the first corner of the game. Hinchliffe was unsighted as he palmed away a waist-high ball which bounced off defender Wright and dribbled over the line. County began to get back into it, with Macauley Southam-Hales looking dangerous down the right, and his cross saw Craig MacGillivray pull off a wonderful one-handed save from Paddy Madden's diving header midway through the first half.But MacGillivray could do nothing to stop the equaliser when Rydel's powerful low shot from the left corner of the 18-yard box came back off the foot of the right post and straight to Collar, who made no mistake from six yards. Charlton were lucky not to concede a 30th-minute penalty when Sean Clare appeared to push over Myles Hippolyte, while MacGillivray did well to keep out two Paddy Madden efforts in quick succession five minutes later.Collar saw a header go wide before Rydel struck the upright in the 50th minute as Stockport began the second half the way they had ended the first. But they had to wait until the 73rd minute to go ahead when Hippolyte's ball into the box was knocked into Collar's path by Kyle Wootton and he blasted home right-footed. Collar completed his hat-trick from the spot after Ollie Crankshaw had been fouled in the box by George Dobson, and although Jack Payne went close during nine minutes of stoppage time, Charlton's woes continued. Stockport County manager Dave Challinor told BBC Radio Manchester:""It was a bit of a strange atmosphere, maybe we're victims of our own success a little bit, a lot of people came here and maybe more than in other games, expected us to win.""Maybe that was halted by us conceding a poor goal and giving ourselves a bit more to do, but once we equalised I thought we then made it the cup tie we needed it to be.""I don't think by any stretch we were brilliant, but what we were is we were tough to play against.""Will will take all the plaudits, rightly so, he's now back to his goalscoring form that he was in last year. ""To get a hat-trick in any game is a brilliant achievement, to get it on the TV in an FA Cup tie that takes us through to the third round is really pleasing and something that he'll remember for the rest of his life.""Charlton Athletic caretaker manager Anthony Hayes told BBC Radio London: ""It's not been an easy 48 hours. We've a group of players to prepare and a cup tie we wanted to win and progress into the third round. It's not been a comfortable couple of days. ""We trained on Tuesday morning, we came up yesterday afternoon, we had some good meetings today but at the end of it we've lost a cup tie 3-1 and we have to focus now on the league.""Where we have to improve as a team, we've had some real good domination and control with the ball, but what we haven't done is dominate enough games by creating chances and then stopping the opposition team creating their own chances. ""We have to be better at dominating games by creating more chances than the opposition and being probably more clinical in the final third. Tonight we haven't worked the goalkeeper anywhere near enough.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63848812

But they fell behind when Zak Brunt cut a corner back to the unmarked George Broadbent just outside the box, and his shot deflected in off the midriff of defender Evans.It was almost two when Broadbent headed a Brunt cross against the upright and although Lee Ndlovu tucked home a ball into the box moments later, it was ruled out for offside.The visitors did not have to wait long for their second, though, as Stephens looped a header beyond James Belshaw and into the net following Femi Ilensanmi's chip - Stephens' first goal since August 2019.Belshaw did well to save a low drive by Cameron Coxe which was heading for the bottom corner, and Rovers were relieved to reach half-time only two down after failing to produce a shot on target themselves despite having most of the possession.George Broadbent's shot deflected off Will Evans for Boreham Wood's opening goalBarton's response was to make four changes at the break, with 38-year-old former Republic of Ireland midfielder Glenn Whelan among those withdrawn, and his team did show greater energy, but Josh Coburn cleared the bar at the near post from Trevor Clarke's ball in.Rovers had not failed to score in a game since 24 September, but Wood - who are 11th in the National League - were content to protect their lead and a speculative Sam Finley shot comfortably saved by Ashmore was the best they could muster in five minutes of added time. They are next in action away to Bolton Wanderers on Friday evening, while Boreham Wood travel to Eastleigh - their first-round victims - the following day.Rovers defender James Connolly told BBC Radio Bristol:""It felt quite flat out there. We maybe could have started a bit faster and the goals were from two set-pieces.""We spoke in the week that it was going to be their game plan, FA Cup, they were going to come with set-pieces. I think that's probably the only way they could have hurt us.""We made a few poor decisions and we weren't strong enough. They had a good shape, they were always going to sit behind the ball, we expected that.""We won't change mindset-wise, it was just an off day. Everyone has them."" Boreham Wood manager Luke Garrard:""I couldn't be more proud of my players, many of whom helped us earn a trip to Everton in the fifth round last season.""What we achieved then was magical, but to be in the third round again is unbelievable - they have risen to every challenge.""I'd have taken a draw just so we were in the hat, but the players delivered and I'm ecstatic.

I was disappointed the third didn't count as Victor was onside.""Our preparation for this game was excellent. We're playing against a team from lower down, that beat Lincoln before. I went to watch them, we did our homework on every player in the squad, we shared it with our players and I thought our players equipped themselves really well.""Deji Oshilaja was outstanding, not just his goals, he was the whole week, and to have those players in your camp, you know you're in a good place.""(Chippenham) showed glimpses in the second half of what they can do, I said in the week they can play if you give them time and space. We missed a few chances but they caused us a few problems in the second half, so credit to them as well.""Chippenham boss Gary Horgan told BBC Radio Wiltshire: ""I am always disappointed when we've lost a game, irrespective of the opposition. ""I am really proud of the second-half performance. I thought we were the better side for the first 15 minutes of the second half, we created a couple of good openings, but as is always likely to happen we got caught on the counter. Fair play to Burton, who were absolutely clinical. ""I am really proud but tinged with disappointment. Maybe we were a bit too passive first half. That wasn't necessarily the plan.

David McGoldrick (right) scores Derby's late winner against NewportNewport were looking the more likely side to break the deadlock, and they went ahead four minutes before half-time.Lewis' free-kick was met by defender Farquharson, who outjumped the Derby defence to power a header beyond Joe Wildsmith.But Derby were a different proposition after the break, with McGoldrick firing over the crossbar from close range.Tom Barkhuizen's teasing cross caused problems, but former Cardiff striker James Collins mishit his effort before McGoldrick forced a save from Joe Day.Derby levelled when Sibley cut inside from the left and produced a curling effort which nestled in the corner of the net.Paul Warne's team very nearly doubled their lead soon after when a Newport clearance rebounded off McGoldrick, with Day reacting quickly to block on the goal-line with his foot.By now it was an end-to-end contest and Wildsmith denied Will Evans and then Cameron Norman before Barkhuizen fired inches wide for the visitors.But it was Derby who sealed victory late on with the experienced McGoldrick heading home Sibley's excellent cross for his seventh goal of the season.Newport County manager Graham Coughlan told BBC Sport Wales:""Obviously it's natural disappointment - opportunity missed, chances galore. We should have, could have, but that doesn't win football games.""Putting the ball in the back of the net and keeping it out at the other end wins football games and we didn't do that today.""Naturally the lads are disappointed, which is understandable. They've pushed a really top club - a top team - really, really hard.""I thought their work-rate, attitude and commitment was absolutely immense.""We've fallen asleep at key moments in the game, made a couple of errors in key moments and they've gone against us.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63660111

Ahadme hit the post with a glancing header after the break, while Shaun Brisley was off target when well placed in a rare attack by their opponents, whose only round-three appearance was 70 years ago.Chaplin scored his second, from 20 yards, when Buxton only half-cleared a Kane Vincent-Young cross, and substitute Kayden Jackson won the ball from Sean Newton before slotting in the fourth just before the end.Relive Sunday's FA Cup action as it happenedIpswich boss Kieran McKenna made five changes to the side which started their first-round victory at Bracknell, while Buxton gave a debut to right-back Max Conway, who was signed on loan from Bolton Wanderers on Friday.After a minute's applause for former Ipswich, Liverpool and England striker David Johnson, who recently died aged 71, Town were soon pushing forward as they looked to use the pace of Burns and Kyle Edwards on the flanks to try to open up the visitors.Ahadme, signed from Burton Albion in the previous transfer window, headed wide from 10 yards when unmarked at a corner, while Chaplin forced a good low save from keeper Theo Richardson as he looked to end a run of 12 games without a goal.Cameron Humphreys clipped the top of the bar with a 20-yard effort but Buxton's defence was finally breached when Burns found Chaplin and he made the space to beat Richardson with his left foot.Conor Chaplin has scored eight goals for Ipswich this seasonBuxton were still recovering from that when Chaplin fed Kyle Edwards and his dinked cross was slid in by Ahadme from three yards as Town produced 17 goal attempts in the half to one by their National League North opponents.With a league game against Fleetwood on Friday probably in mind, McKenna sent on Tawanda Chirewa and Albie Armin, aged 19 and 18 respectively, for the second half - both of whom had only previously appeared in the EFL Trophy.Chirewa was soon shown a yellow card for a foul on Declan Poole but then warmed the palms of Richardson with a powerful drive from 30 yards, before Chaplin's emphatic finish to the top corner made it three.Another 19-year-old, Matt Ward, made his Ipswich debut from the bench as Ahadme was given a breather before Jackson won the ball in the Buxton half and strolled through to add the finishing touch to a dominant display. Ipswich head coach Kieran McKenna told BBC Radio Suffolk:""We wanted to go into the next round and do it professionally, score some goals and keep a clean sheet, so all the boxes are ticked.""Buxton were well-organised, defended well, put their bodies on the line, they didn't make it easy and kept going right the way through the game.""Conor is a goalscorer and doesn't like it when he doesn't for a while, and he was really keen to get on the scoresheet.""He took up good positions all game and got his goals from good spaces coming off the back of the main striker.""Buxton boss Jamie Vermiglio told BBC Radio Derby: ""To get to the second round proper is a fantastic achievement for a non-league club. It's just a shame that we couldn't give the fans a goal or something to cheer about - not that they needed it. ""I've never seen anything like that, that following was superb, they didn't stop all game. At the end it was quite emotional watching them sing their hearts out. Occasions like this don't happen very often.""Ipswich are a top side. Could we have been a bit braver on the ball? Maybe. But they press so well, with intent, it's very difficult to string three or four passes together. ""Other teams have been torn apart by them. We tried to be stubborn, and we were for the first 30 minutes, (but) it's hard when you concede."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63708768

A tight, intriguing first half saw both sides go close and have decent shouts for penalties waved away.But the League Two high flyers proved their quality after the interval, seizing control from the moment Luke Morris side-footed in the opener following Jamie Reid's classy turn and cut-back.Norris swiftly made it 2-0 with simple close-range header and, with the Linnets still reeling, the excellent Reid curled home a delicious third to effectively settle the match.Saturday's FA Cup second-round actionUnbeaten at home in the league this season, Lynn's chances of extending that impressive form on a crisp sunny day, and teeing up a potential glamour tie against top-flight opposition, looked good as they more than held their own before the interval, with Josh Barrett the standout attacking player.The former Reading striker caused countless problems with his pace and direct running and had three attempts on goal - albeit all off target - in front of a 4,203 crowd and live TV audience.But Stevenage, resurgent and second in the fourth tier under much-travelled boss Steve Evans, who twice guided former club Crawley to the fifth round of the competition, showed glimpses of their quality with some slick moves. And they created the best opportunity when Reid, their biggest threat, did well to cut inside and get a decent strike away which keeper Paul Jones somehow flicked over the bar with his outstretched left leg as he was diving the other way.The Linnets, conquerors of Doncaster Rovers in the first round, had won 14 of their 23 games in all competitions this season, but were blown away after the break.It was no surprise that Reid was the creator of the 49th-minute opener, turning his man and slipping the ball across the box for Norris to calmly find the bottom corner.Norris struck again within two minutes, powering in a header from six yards from a perfect Luther James-Wildin cross.And Reid then got the goal his performance deserved, breaking free on the left, shifting the ball onto his right foot and curling it with pace into the far corner.The animated figured of King's Lynn boss Tommy Widdrington could not inspire his side to an unlikely comeback as the visitors eased to 24th win in 37 games under Evans and progressed beyond round two for the third time in six seasons.Strictly Come Dancing's Kai Widdrington (right) was among the crowd at The Walks to watch father Tommy's King's Lynn sideKing's Lynn manager Tommy Widdrington:""It's a bittersweet moment isn't it? The occasion's been fantastic and I'm delighted my lads have experienced that.""We were excellent first half, we contained them. I genuinely feel we had a penalty in the first half and they probably did as well, to be fair.""I heard Steve Evans at half-time and he was absolutely tearing the wallpaper off. He was obviously concerned.""It's not the result we wanted, but it's probably the result everyone expected. I wish them all the best and hope they get the plum draw they want.""Stevenage boss Steve Evans told BBC One:""King's Lynn were tremendous in the first half. We were poor first half, it was a proper cup tie.""What I said at half-time can't be repeated on the BBC, I wasn't throwing tea cups but I was strong, and for 15 minutes at the start of the second half we stepped up how we can play and we could have won by more.""When the first one went in, they were shell-shocked and away we went and we won comfortably.""We need to do better than we did today, especially in the first half, against better opposition.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63708649

Accrington manager John Coleman told BBC Radio Lancashire:""It was a tough game, Barnet had a lot of the game, particularly in the first half and made it difficult for us. ""We hit the post early but didn't really get going in the first half and everything we knew about Barnet, we seemed to help them on their way.""We had the wind second half and it was always going to be a scrappy goal that settled a scrappy game.""Barnet boss Dean Brennan told BBC Radio London:""You're thinking when you get to the 80th minute, can we get them back to The Hive?""There was break in play and then our lads are adamant there was a handball.""Overall, that bit of luck you need in the cup just didn't go our way.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63708663

The Dons were unbeaten in 10 games and the Spireites came looking for a sixth win on the spin and it was the non-leaguers who dominated most of the first half with their energy and drive.Saturday's FA Cup second-round actionAfter Liam Mandeville's early shot was deflected wide, only a fine finger-tip save from Tzanev denied the visitors the lead as the New Zealand international pushed Joe Quigley's thumping header from Jamie Grimes' cross behind for a corner.Wimbledon were strangely subdued but nearly went in front against the run of play as Chislett sprung the offside trap, rounded keeper Ross Fitzsimons but saw Mandeville clear excellently off the line. Chesterfield recovered well from that wobble and took the lead just before the break. Dobra led a brilliant break from his own half and found Quigley, whose perfectly-weighted return ball was sweetly lifted past Tzanev by the former Ipswich Town player, who scored the winner to knock out League Two side Northampton in the first round.With only 13 places separating the two sides in the pyramid, Chesterfield continued to show little inferiority in the second half as King and Mike Jones both went close to increasing the lead.The Dons continued to be off-colour with Harry Pell's wasteful scoop over from substitute Huseyin Biler's cross into the box typical of their afternoon.With time running out their hopes of making the third round for the sixth time in the past seven seasons were effectively snuffed out as King's fortunate-looking goal decided it.Seemingly aiming a right-wing cross towards the far post, King saw it end up nestling in the corner after Tzanev got the flight of the ball wrong and was left a helpless spectator.Their win marked the first time since 1969 that Chesterfield have made it to the third round two seasons in a row and Paul Cook's side would love a repeat of 12 months ago when they landed a trip to Premier League Chelsea.Chesterfield goal scorer Armando Dobra told BBC Radio Sheffield:""It was a really, really good performance from the team. I thought we dominated from the first minute to the end.""They were 10 unbeaten but we're on a run ourselves and we go into every game thinking we're going to win.""We took our chances really well - I won it off the full-back, drove in and found Quigsey [Joe Quigley], the centre-half's gone with him and left a big space for me and I've taken it and put it in the back of the net.""Hopefully we can get a big team in the next round - I support Manchester United so United away would be good.""AFC Wimbledon boss Johnnie Jackson:""It was a pretty flat performance from us considering where we've been. We perhaps paid the price of the tough schedule and the run of games we've had.""We feared it might take its toll at some stage. We had moments and it could have been different in certain situations but that doesn't represent where we've been as a team.""The FA Cup is special to the club.

Daniel Agyei broke down the right, but his effort struck the side netting from a tight angle.The home side broke the deadlock on the half-hour mark as Crewe failed to clear Connell's cross and top-scorer Cole reacted quickest to tap home from a few yards out.Phillips doubled Barnsley's advantage in the 50th minute when he was played through by Kitching and fired into the roof of the net to claim his fourth goal in five games.Michael Duff's side were awarded a penalty shortly after when Connell was fouled inside the box in the 57th minute and Benson stepped up and struck left of Arthur Okonkwo to make it 3-0.Match report supplied by PA Media.Barnsley first-team coach Martin Devaney told BBC Radio Sheffield:""Crewe are a good team, they sat in and we found it difficult at times to try and break them down.""We got the goal from a set-piece and then second half, we were just trying to play football, staying calm and patient and working on that final pass.""If you look at the team (on the pitch) at the end, I don't know what the average age was, but it was very, very young.""It would be great to get a Premiership club (in the draw), that's what the FA Cup is all about, great for the fans and brings extra people in.

We are disappointed with the last half an hour but we showed spirit.""Milton Keynes boss Liam Manning told BBC Three Counties Radio:""The lads were terrific in terms of attitude, drive and intensity right until the end and that has to be what underpins a performance.""Discipline and quality was what cost us ultimately but there was so many things to take out of the game.""We shifted the momentum in the first half and looked dangerous and then second half I was extremely disappointed with the manner of the goals we conceded.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63708712

Lee Gregory headed just wide from Mallik Wilks' cross at the other end moments later.Wednesday found an equaliser after 78 minutes when Marvin Johnson squared the ball across the box and Smith finished from close range.The same two players linked up in the 83rd minute and Smith once again tapped home to see the Owls through to the third round.Match report supplied by PA Media.Sheffield Wednesday manager Darren Moore:""I knew the mindset they'd be in and that we could be in for a long afternoon. Credit to Mansfield, they sat in and broke on us well.""We made some changes to let a few players stretch their legs.

The cohesion of the team wasn't there.""On another day we could've been knocked out or had a replay which we wanted to avoid. Michael (Smith) came on and did what he does best. There was a real quality to our goals.""Mansfield boss Nigel Clough:""We had lots of chances in the first half which we didn't finish well enough. We created the chances and we just needed someone on the end of them.""We have to score more if we're not going to defend as well as we should do. I thought we'd at least take them back to our place but we just weren't quite good enough in both penalty areas.""There are lots of positives to take from the performance, we've been as good as a side at the top of League One. We showed so much heart and spirit.""I hope the fans are proud. Like us, they will be scratching their heads as to how we're not in the hat.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63708719

We rallied and scored a good goal but then the next two goals are really dreadful to concede.

(But) Last thing we need is a replay - that was our 28th game of the season, that's a joke. By the time we play the replay it'll be our 30th game. ""Did we deserve a replay? I'm not sure about that, I thought Dagenham were the better team. First half was even, but in the second we were poor quality at times.""Kash spends too much time outside the penalty area for me. I'm pleased he's come on and had an impact, but it took us till 75 minutes to really get going and that's not really acceptable.""Dagenham & Redbridge manager Daryl McMahon:""We probably dropped a little bit too deep towards the end but that sometimes happens in cup ties when you are 1-0 up, although I don't think we were hanging on. ""I don't think Gillingham created much apart from the goal so that is disappointing for us but I'd be more disappointed if I was Gillingham.

I thought defensively we were excellent.""They're difficult to play against. You can see from the stats in League Two, they keep the ball for 70 or 80% of the play and you've got to be really calm and controlled in what you do.""You've got to wait and set traps and punish them. The first half we were really good at it and probably should have scored more than the one. ""Second half for a 20-minute spell we were a little bit sloppy. I think it was the fact we tried to score again and kept going to places we probably didn't need to, but to get the second goal was pleasing for us and the third just killed the game.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63625642

The Gulls had some good chances before Derby hit them on the break for their third through Liam Thompson seven minutes before half time. Lewis Dobbin's thunderous volley into the top corner make it 4-0 before David McGoldrick added the Rams' fifth from 10 yards.Derby will now travel to League Two side Newport County on 27 November.Relive Tuesday's FA Cup replays action as it happenedHaving drawn 2-2 in their first FA Cup first round tie in 38 years at Plainmoor, Derby were determined not to be the biggest name to go out, especially after holding Liverpool to a goalless draw at Anfield in the Carabao Cup last week before losing on penalties. But Paul Warne's side need not have worried despite Torquay's bright start, as experienced defender Ellis gifted them the opener by heading in Haydon Roberts' cross from the left wing.It was 2-0 soon after as Osula's low first-time shot from the edge of the box found the bottom corner following a lay-off from McGoldrick following Max Bird's good pass forward.They could have been three ahead soon after as  Dobbin saw a shot saved by Mark Halstead after breaking clear, while Louis Sibley had an effort from inside the box blocked by Ellis. The Gulls - who are in the fifth tier's relegation places - did have their moments during a 10-minute spell midway through the half as Lucas Ness' floating header was cleared off the line and Asa Hall had a shot blocked.Rams keeper Joe Wildsmith had to be at his best to save an effort from Will Goodwin before smothering Aaron Jarvis' shot from the rebound  andthen palmed over another Ness header from a corner.'Terrible error' Torquay own goal hands Derby leadDerby sucked any remaining belief out of the National League strugglers as they hit them on the break for their third goal - Osula's excellent pass found Thompson on the right side of the penalty area and the young midfielder cut in on his left foot and shot low past Halstead.The Rams continued to create chances after the break and were rewarded when Everton loanee Dobbin reacted quickest to a cleared corner and unleashed an unstoppable volley from the edge of the box that rattled into the top corner. Veteran forward McGoldrick - who impressed all night - made it five as he controlled James Collins' shot before swivelling and firing low into the Gulls' net.

""We stretched it when we had to, I thought we over-complicated it, at one stage we could have been six up and then they could have scored three, so it was just a bit too open for my liking.""I didn't want it to be a basketball match, and when we got through I wanted us to take more of our chances.

415,Bracknell Town 0-3 Ipswich Town: League One promotion-chasers reach round two of FA Cup,MON 07 Nov 2022,fa-cup,"Ipswich overcome non-league Bracknell in FA CupIpswich Town shrugged off a determined challenge from non-league Bracknell to set up a home second-round tie with Buxton in the FA Cup.The Southern League Premier Division South side had a strong wind behind them in the opening half, but goalkeeper Michael Eacott had to make three good saves to keep them on level terms at the interval.Their resistance was broken when Kane Vincent-Young's cut-back was turned into his own net by Dan Bayliss and the wing-back provided a second assist as Freddie Ladapo doubled the lead from close range.Vincent-Young had a goal disallowed for offside but the League One visitors added the clincher as Wes Burns squared for fellow substitute Panutche Camara to score with his first touch.Relive Monday's FA Cup action as it happenedFull second-round drawIn the first round for only the second time in their history, Bracknell had top scorer Jordan Esprit back in their line-up, while Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna retained only four of his starters from the 4-4 draw with Charlton in their most recent league game.The home side showed plenty of early intent, pressing high up the pitch and harrying Town into errors - although Jack Dean was perhaps fortunate to escape with only a yellow card after a reckless challenge on Kayden Jackson.The two keepers were virtual spectators for the first half hour before Ipswich finally asserted themselves, and Eacott had to push away Ladapo's shoulder-high sidefooted effort.Ipswich's best moments came down the left and when Kyle Edwards cut one back into the box, Eacott made an instinctive save with his feet to deny Vincent-Young.It looked like Ipswich - playing a non-league team in the first round for the first time since 1956 - were certain to break the deadlock after the break when the ball was threaded through to Vincent-Young, but Bayliss produced a magnificent last-ditch tackle to snuff out the opportunity. Dan Bayliss was just off target for Bracknell only moments before his own goal put Ipswich in frontWith rain pouring down, Bracknell finally produced their first shot on target in the 57th minute but Town keeper Vaclav Hladky was solidly behind Gary Abisogun's low 20-yard effort and Eacott had to be alert at the other end to block a shot from Ladapo.Bayliss hooked wide as Ipswich struggled to clear a ball into their box, but just moments later the defender scored at the wrong end as he slid in to try and clear.The goals by Ladapo and Camara - the latter in only his second Town appearance - were simple finishes against tiring opponents but Bracknell at least had the consolation of improving on their 4-0 first-round defeat by Lincoln in 2000-01.For the Tractor Boys, meanwhile, it was just a third FA Cup victory in their past 24 ties.Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna will be hopeful of beating National League North Buxton to reach the third roundBracknell co-manager Jamie McClurg told BBC Radio Berkshire:""They were exceptional, every single one of them, I don't think they deserved a 3-0 loss.""Ipswich controlled possession but the boys were resilient, we had a couple of half-chances and on another day maybe we'd have nicked something and it would have been a fairytale story.""Since the [first-round] draw, with all the distractions that can easily happen, they've won every game and been brilliant in training and we're going to get stronger and stronger.""The fans were amazing. You could feel the energy in the stadium. I just hope they keep coming back."" Ipswich head coach Kieran McKenna told BBC Radio Suffolk:""It was a nice occasion, especially for Bracknell, it's their night, and I thought they did a great job with the infrastructure and how they facilitated the game, it's not easy to have 2,000 and the TV cameras here.""And the pitch as well, there was a lot of heavy rainfall and they did a good job getting it as good as it could be, and they should be proud with how they conducted themselves on and off the pitch.""For us, it's a nice one to come through. All the responsibility is on you to go and win the game and nothing else is acceptable - and rightly so.""It's hard to really enjoy it until you get the first goal and then after that we were able to enjoy it a little bit more.""

The hosts were impressive from the start as Elliot Lee's neat backheel set up Mullin, whose shot deflected off David Okagbue and over the crossbar for a corner.Within three minutes Wrexham were ahead with keeper Jayson Leutwiler only able to parry Luke Young's low long-range effort, presenting Dalby with a simple tap-in.Sam Dalby gave Wrexham a 10th minute lead against OldhamWhen OIdham ventured forward, former Dragon Ben Tollitt's cross was gathered comfortably by Mark Howard and later on Timmy Abraham fired wide.But that apart it was the home side who were firmly in control and playing some fine football, with Callum McFadzean denied by Leutwiler before the inevitable second goal.Goalscorer Dalby was the provider this time, playing in Mullin who resisted the chance to have an effort and cut inside into the box and wrongfooted the keeper.Young flashed a rasping shot past the post as the first half drew to a close.Abraham's header from Nathan Sheron's cross was gathered by Howard but they would fall further behind.Mullin, on his 28th birthday, flicked the ball on from Ben Tozer's long throw-in to extend Wrexham's lead just after the hour mark.They could have stretched further ahead with Lee having an effort cleared off the line and another blocked with a long range Mullin shot parried by Leutwiler.Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said:""I thought it was a very good performance - honest, hardworking with some real quality in there as well.""It was important we showed everyone what this club's all about, and the atmosphere was fantastic.""But the way the lads went about their business I thought was very professional and there's a great togetherness out there.""I'm very pleased to progress into the next round.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63454329

U's boss Mark Bonner was able to recall experienced Harrison Dunk to his side, while defenders Connor Hampson and Devon Matthews were passed fit for Curzon Ashton - but they lost Ryan Hall with a knock in the 20th minute, with DiMaio sent on as his replacement.There was little sign of a 70-place gap between the two clubs in the opening half as Hampson produced the game's first shot on target, saved comfortably by Mannion, after Harvey Knibbs had missed an open goal at the other end, while Josh Hancock was narrowly wide after Tom Peers robbed U's defender Zeno Rossi.But the closest to a goal before the break came in added time as Will Hayhurst headed down and DiMaio's left-foot effort flashed inches over the bar.Connor DiMaio's volley at the end of the first half was just too high for Curzon AshtonCurzon made a positive start to the second half but the U's gradually lifted their game, with Renshaw forced to kick away a goal-bound effort by Lewis Simper and Harvey Knibbs meeting a Tracey cross but directing his header over the bar.Home manager Adam Lakeland sent on 6ft 5ins target man George Waring in the final 10 minutes, but it was Richards who came closest to a winner with a curling free-kick after a foul by Digby which Mannion saw late, but just in time to push it out for a corner.Curzon Ashton manager Adam Lakeland:""I'm really proud of the players. We gave a really good account of ourselves and I can't really ask for any more than that.""I thought our discipline and concentration, and the way we played out the game tactically, was brilliant.""We're not flashy but we compete well at our own level, and I knew we'd compete well against Cambridge.""Obviously we know that they were huge favourites, and they will be for the replay. It's going to be a mammoth challenge but our away form has been good this season, so this tie isn't over yet.""Cambridge head coach Mark Bonner told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire:""It took us too long to get going, to be a creative force in the game.""We've got to score more - these players have got to find that level and I've got to get it out of them. ""There were a couple of good chances in the first half and a couple of very good ones in the second. But we need a little more craft, creativity and tempo. We've got to work harder to make more clever and faster forward runs.""Until January, these are the 17,18 players we've got fit and there's nobody else to come back. Right now it's about getting the best out of the players we've got."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63461406
418,Torquay United 2-2 Derby County: Will Goodwin secures National League side a replay against League One Rams,SUN 06 Nov 2022,fa-cup,"Torquay United 2-2 Derby County - highlightsWill Goodwin turned in a stoppage-time equaliser to give National League strugglers Torquay United a replay against 10-man Derby County in a pulsating first-round tie steeped in the classic traditions of the FA Cup.Two clinical strikes from Will Osula had seemingly put the League One side - playing in the first round for the first time for 37 years - firmly on course for round two, only for the Gulls to get back into it 10 minutes into the second half via an Asa Hall penalty that saw Eiran Cashin sent off for pulling back Goodwin in the box.Roared on by a baying home crowd in the pouring rain at Plainmoor, Torquay surged forward and after Hall twice went close, Goodwin sent the supporters wild 42 seconds into added time at the end of stoppage time by deflecting a snap shot from Aaron Jarvis past keeper Joe Wildsmith.That capped a superb comeback from Torquay, who were looking to win their first FA Cup tie for 11 years and looked out of it after Osula's double.Relive Sunday's FA Cup action as it happenedThe teenager, on loan from Sheffield United, tucked home Max Bird's crisp low centre at the near post on 27 minutes before he drilled in his second 71 seconds into the second half, burying a left-footed shot past keeper Mark Halstead after turning a back-peddling Mark Ellis inside out with a twisting run into the area.Having matched the Rams in an opening quarter played at a frantic pace, Torquay, 65 places below Derby in the football pyramid, had faded but were handed a way back into the tie when Cashin pulled Goodwin down inside the box. Referee David Rock sent the Irishman off, despite the presence of covering defenders, for not making an attempt to challenge for the ball.Veteran Hall slammed in the spot-kick to rejuvenate the Gulls, who stormed back into the tie on a wave of raucous home support as the rain lashed down and the pitch grew heavier.Captain Hall twice went close with a shot on the turn and a diving header before Shaun Donnellan fizzed a 20-yarder inches wide and Dylan Crowe sent a curling effort over from the edge of the box as an increasingly nervous Derby held on. With time running out, Gulls goalkeeper Halstead went up for a corner and when Derby repelled it that seemed to end Torquay hopes.But they won the ball back, launched it into the area and with Halstead challenging, the ball rebounded out to Jarvis, whose drive was instinctively diverted into the net by Goodwin from six yards to trigger delirium and a much-deserved replay.Torquay manager Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Devon:""It was a fantastic cup tie - you like to be involved in these types of cup ties.""At 2-0 down everybody's thinking 'this game's over', but it's never over with our lads. ""They're learning what 100% effort means. It's not always 100% quality given the level we're at, but the given is that you've got to give 100% effort.""I've been asking Will to be in dangerous positions - that's where I've been telling him to end up when anyone else is shooting. Even if you have to nick somebody else's shot, that might be going in.""Derby boss Paul Warne told BBC Radio Derby:""At 2-0 I thought, maybe arrogantly, that we'd keep control of the ball and ask them more questions.""But then the sending-off and the penalty - we're causing our own problems and down to 10 men, no matter who you're playing, they're going to throw everything at it.""The goalie goes up for the corner, the crowd are right behind them, the wind's behind them - everything seemed against us. We just didn't do enough.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63461420
419,South Shields 0-2 Forest Green Rovers: Connor Wickham scores from halfway line,SAT 05 Nov 2022,fa-cup,"FA Cup highlights: South Shields 0-2 Forest GreenA stunning Connor Wickham strike from the halfway line sealed victory for Forest Green Rovers as they withstood a gutsy performance by Northern Premier League side South Shields to progress into the second round of the FA Cup.Seventh-tier South Shields were outclassed by a League One side 78 places above them in the first half and trailed to Wickham's untidy close-range finish from Corey O'Keeffe's exquisite cross.The Mariners played with far greater urgency in front of a noisy record home crowd of almost 4,000 after the break and had several excellent opportunities to level, most notably through a Michael Woods header and a Blair Adams strike which hit the outside of the post.A delightful late dipping volley by Tom Broadbent also went agonisingly wide but Rovers, who are 23rd in the third tier and have won just three league games all season, made sure of the win in the final seconds of added time when Wickham spotted keeper Myles Boney off his line and scored with a outrageous lob.Follow Saturday's FA Cup actionPhillips chasing Cup gloryWickham's sensational second goal was a fitting way to end an enthralling cup tie at the 1st Cloud Arena but the result was harsh on the hosts following their second-half display.As the only full-time team in the seventh tier, and with a sizeable sprinkling of Football League experience among their numbers, South Shields were perhaps not as big an underdog as they first appeared.FA Cup: Connor Wickham scores amazing lob from halfway lineKevin Phillips' side have lost just once in the league this season, winning seven of their 12 games, and would be top of the table if they won their games in hand.And their chances of reaching the FA Cup second round for the first time in their history certainly looked decent as they more than held their own in the early stages, with the competition's top-scorer Dylan Mottley-Henry a lively presence who always looked capable add to his five goals from his side's four qualifying rounds.But they failed to build on an encouraging opening and failed to muster an attempt on target in the first half, with the visitors dominating possession and having the better chances.The best one saw a slick move free the impressive O'Keeffe on the right and the wing-back's delightful curling cross was so good that even though ex-Ipswich, Sunderland and Crystal Palace forward Wickham mistimed his header, the ball easily beat keeper Boney via his shoulder.Former England and Sunderland striker Phillips looked slightly agitated by his side's first-half display and during a quick pitchside BBC One interview at half-time said they gave their opponents too much respect.Former Sunderland and England striker Kevin Phillips was appointed South Shields boss in JanuaryThe players responded on the resumption, pressing higher up the pitch, playing with much greater urgency and denying Rovers time on the ball. It almost brought instant rewards when Woods, once on the books of Chelsea, sent a header a fraction wide from Conor Newton's tantalising cross.Woods also took a heavy touch when trying to improve on an already decent shooting position and was crowded out after more great work by Mottley-Henry, while Rovers keeper Lewis Thomas was finally tested by a Dillon Morse header that he had little trouble in stopping.The pressure continued and the hosts came even closer when Adams got in behind the Rovers defence on the left but saw his low strike hit the outside of the post.But with away nerves still jangling after Broadbent's volley, Wickham's audacious attempt ensured Forest Green's victory - their first since they beat Billericay 4-0 in the first round in 2019.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63461117

453,FA Cup: Hereford 1-3 Portsmouth - Cowley's men recover to beat non-league Bulls,FRI 04 Nov 2022,fa-cup,"Hereford 1-3 Portsmouth highlightsPortsmouth came from behind to beat non-league Hereford at Edgar Street and progress to the second round of the FA Cup. In the week that the Bulls lost their most famous ex-player, FA Cup legend Ronnie Radford - 50 years on from his iconic match-winning goal against Newcastle - it briefly looked like there might be some left-over magic in the air.For seven minutes, the sixth-tier outfit led after Miles Storey's goal against the team 81 places above them in the English football pyramid in League One.But Pompey hit back, with Reeco Hackett quickly levelling before second-half goals from Colby Bishop and substitute Joe Pigott earned the twice FA Cup winners a safe passage to Monday's second-round draw.Hereford hope to do Ronnie Radford proudRelive Portsmouth's FA Cup win at non-league HerefordMaking their first trip to Edgar Street in 38 years, Pompey were given a good first-half workout by the fired-up hosts.Although home keeper Dale Eve had to keep out Hackett's left-foot curler bound for the top corner, Pompey had a first real scare when Bishop's challenge on Hereford's former million-pound marksman Tyrone Barnett in the visitors' penalty box went unpunished.And there was worse to follow for Pompey when Hereford took the lead on 26 minutes.Sean Raggett played a loose pass inside to Hackett, who was immediately closed down and robbed by Storey - and the former Pompey player raced away down the inside-left channel before keeping his cool to nutmeg on-loan West Bromwich Albion keeper Josh Griffiths.Portsmouth celebrated victory on their first trip to Edgar Street in 38 yearsFittingly, just two days on from the announcement of the sad passing of Hereford's legendary number 11, their modern-day number 11 emulated his predecessor. There had already been a minute's silence, which cascaded into applause from the whole ground, followed by chants of 'there's only one Ronnie Radford' when the clock showed 11 minutes.But this goal was destined not to prove so famous.Ronan Curtis headed down Connor Ogilvie's far-post cross for Hackett to bring down and fire home coolly from six yards.On 63 minutes, Portsmouth took the lead when, from Clark Robertson's in-swinging right-foot corner from the left, Bishop timed his run to get there first and head his 10th goal of the season.And Pigott wrapped up victory 10 minutes from time when, again from a corner by skipper Robertson, Bishop won the initial header before Pigott reacted sharpest to sidefoot home.Joe Pigott was on hand to score Portsmouth's third and put the tie beyond doubtHereford FC boss Josh Gowling told BBC Sport:""I'm really disappointed because we should have got something out of it, but goals change games - and the quality of the delivery they have changes games.""In the first half we were excellent. We were in the ascendancy and they looked nervous.""We were on top and looked like we could go on and win, but we've made one mistake, it has cost us a goal and that's the difference in levels.""We've given them a leg up and a little lift and you could see their performance raise after that.""Portsmouth boss Danny Cowley told BBC Sport:""I was so sad to hear the news about Ronnie Radford. He was such an iconic figure and he had that iconic moment. For a lot of people my age, his famous goal was their first memories of the FA Cup. But what a brilliant night to celebrate his life.""I love football and I love the FA Cup. This is raw, it's real. It was a great atmosphere. And the final word should go to Hereford FC, because they've had it really tough, nearly lost their club and have come fighting back.""It was a proper football game, between two proper football clubs both saved by their supporters. And we knew this was going to be our most difficult game of the season.""The first half proved that. Their players were outstanding and gave us real problems first half. We had to find a lot of character. Our young players will have learned a lot. A couple of them found it really difficult first half and will be better for that experience, but ultimately we found our way.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63461110

457,Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties to win FA Cup and keep quadruple hopes alive,SAT 14 May 2022,fa-cup,"Liverpool lifted the FA Cup for the eighth time in the club's historyLiverpool remain in the hunt for a historic quadruple after winning the FA Cup following another Wembley penalty shootout against Chelsea. Jurgen Klopp's side repeated their Carabao Cup final victory in February, the decisive moment coming when Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson saved Mason Mount's spot-kick, leaving Kostas Tsimikas to secure Liverpool's second trophy of the season. The Reds are still in the Premier League title race and have the Champions League final to come against Real Madrid. Liverpool had the better of an eventful final, with the outstanding Luis Diaz and Andrew Robertson hitting the woodwork, although it may come at a price with Mohamed Salah going off injured in the first half and Virgil van Dijk going off after 90 minutes. It is a devastating blow for Chelsea and manager Thomas Tuchel to lose in this manner yet again as they had chances - with Marcos Alonso hitting the post and also being denied by Alisson - but become the first side to lose three successive FA Cup finals. Relive the action at WembleyFA Cup final player raterLiverpool come through againTsimikas scores winning penalty for Liverpool against ChelseaWhen Edouard Mendy saved Senegal team-mate Sadio Mane's penalty in the shootout, when the Liverpool forward only needed to score to win the FA Cup, it just seemed for one moment that the Reds' assault on four trophies might just be interrupted. Alisson put Liverpool back on course when he saved from Mount, who was inconsolable as Tsimikas sent the Liverpool fans wild by converting the final penalty. Once again Liverpool had prevailed against fiercely disciplined and determined opponents, even though they lost Salah to what looked like a muscle injury before half-time and Van Dijk did not emerge for extra time. It remains to be seen how serious those problems are but at present it looks like Liverpool can overcome most obstacles put in front of them, even though it once again took penalties to claim their first FA Cup since 2006. Diaz was the game's outstanding player, running Chelsea ragged and peppering Mendy's goal with efforts until he was substituted, exhausted, to a standing ovation. Klopp refers to his players as ""mentality monsters"" and this illustrates why. Players from both sides gave so much that they were almost out on their feet at the final whistle. Manchester City remain favourites in the Premier League, three points ahead and with a superior goal difference, and this was a strength-sapping occasion that will have taken much out of Liverpool before they face Southampton at St Mary's on Tuesday. What we do know, though, is that Liverpool possess remarkable powers of resilience and recovery as they continue their march on history. Chelsea suffer more Wembley agony Highlights: Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties to win 2022 FA CupChelsea manager Tuchel thought redemption was at hand when Mendy saved from Mane, bringing the shootout scoreline back level after Cesar Azplicueta had hit the post earlier. It was not to be though and the German understandably looked utterly disconsolate as he walked up to collect another Wembley losers' medal. This was a chance to set the record straight after losing the EFL Cup final on penalties in February, instead it was only more agony for Tuchel and his players after they gave everything in search of victory. It will be of no consolation whatsoever that Chelsea have now matched Liverpool in two Wembley finals - and drawn both Premier League games - only to end empty-handed when it came to the four main trophies on offer this season. Chelsea have won the Club World Cup and the Uefa Super Cup but they will not be factored into what has ultimately been a disappointing season. They had their chances once again but could not cash in, with both Mount and Alonso denied crucially by Alisson. Tuchel gave Romelu Lukaku a start but once again the £97.5m striker could not deliver. There was no lack of effort but no spark and he was eventually substituted. There will now be a period of rebuilding, with Antonio Rudiger off to Real Madrid and captain Azpilicueta also expected to leave as the club embarks on a new era under new ownership once Roman Abramovich's sale of the club has been completed.Chelsea will have a place in next season's Champions League as reward for their efforts this term but, make no mistake, this will have been a very bitter pill for Tuchel and his players to swallow.

458,FA Cup semi-final: Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace - Blues win at Wembley,SUN 17 Apr 2022,fa-cup,"Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace: Chelsea into FA Cup final with win over PalaceChelsea set up a second Wembley meeting with Liverpool this season as they overcame Crystal Palace's stubborn resistance to reach the FA Cup final. Liverpool won the Carabao Cup final on penalties in February but Chelsea will have the chance for revenge as second-half goals from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount underlined their supremacy. Unlike the first semi-final between Liverpool and Manchester City, chances were at a premium until substitute Loftus-Cheek, on for the injured Mateo Kovacic, broke the deadlock with a deflected shot after 65 minutes. Palace had their opportunities, Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy saving well from Cheikhou Kouyate in the first half, but they could not come back after Mount slipped a low finish beyond Jack Butland with 14 minutes left. 'Chelsea again show ability to thrive amid chaos'Relive Chelsea's FA Cup semi-final win over Crystal PalaceThird time lucky for Chelsea?Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace: Thomas Tuchel happy with ""patient"" ChelseaChelsea have deservedly reached their third successive FA Cup final and will now hope to reverse recent history after losing the previous two to Arsenal and Leicester City. Manager Thomas Tuchel has a remarkable record in reaching domestic and European finals since his appointment and Chelsea will be formidable opponents for Liverpool, who are in search of a historic quadruple. Chelsea had to work had for their triumph but they showed patience, organisation and then quality to take control after half-time. By the end, Chelsea were in complete command and only some generosity in front of goal from substitute Romelu Lukaku, who struck the post when it seemed easier to score, and the otherwise excellent Timo Werner prevented a scoreline that would have been harsh on Palace. Chelsea may be surrounded by turmoil off the pitch amid the sanctions against owner Roman Abramovich, but a winning mentality persists on it and the players showed admirable powers of recovery following the disappointment of their Champions League quarter-final elimination by Real Madrid. And if the EFL Cup final between Chelsea and Liverpool earlier this season is anything to go by, the FA Cup equivalent will be a tightly-contested affair between two high-quality sides. Palace on the right trackChelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace: Patrick Vieira praises players effortsPalace manager Patrick Vieira and his players were understandably devastated at the final whistle but the Eagles' performance here, and over the season as a whole, gives great cause for optimism. Vieira has squad boasting several emerging young talents playing attractive football, although they were required to show a more pragmatic side here as they contained Chelsea well until their former loanee Loftus-Cheek struck with an effort that took a slight deflection. There was no way back for Palace after that but, backed by truly magnificent support, they give the impression of a well-run club on the right lines under an astute manager with an excellent structure around him. Danger man Wilfried Zaha was just too isolated to make an impression but the key component missing was the guile, quality and exuberance of England midfield man Conor Gallagher, who was unable to play against his parent club. Defeat will hurt, but Vieira and Palace can nevertheless be delighted with the progress the club is making. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61119547
459,FA Cup semi-final: Man City 2-3 Liverpool - Sadio Mane double helps Jurgen Klopp's side through,SAT 16 Apr 2022,fa-cup,"Highlights: Man City 2-3 LiverpoolLiverpool survived a late scare to remain on course for an historic quadruple as they reached the FA Cup final with victory over Manchester City at Wembley. If last Sunday's Premier League meeting between the clubs was a classic, this semi-final was effectively decided in a one-sided first 45 minutes, in which a mixture of ruthless finishing and Manchester City mistakes saw Liverpool take a 3-0 lead. A reshuffled City side were unable to recover as Liverpool, having won the Carabao Cup, are now in the FA Cup final too - as well as the last four of the Champions League, while sitting second in the Premier League. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who was unable to start Kevin de Bruyne and had Kyle Walker out injured, preferred Zack Steffen to Ederson in goal, a move that back-fired spectacularly. Ibrahima Konate had already headed Liverpool in front after nine minutes when Steffen, trying to repeat the feats of Ederson in the league game between these two clubs, miscontrolled in his six-yard area, allowing Sadio Mane to pounce. Mane beat Steffen with a crisp volley at the end of a superb Liverpool build-up to put Jurgen Klopp's side in complete command at the break but Jack Grealish pulled one back early in the second half and keeper Alisson twice saved crucially from Gabriel Jesus as this semi-final sprang to life.Bernardo Silva pulled another back for City at the start of a tense period of stoppage time but Liverpool survived to face either Chelsea or Crystal Palace, who meet at Wembley on Sunday, in the final on 14 May. One of Liverpool's best ever performances - KloppDo Liverpool now hold psychological edge?Relive Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final winMan City sorry as Hillsborough silence interruptedLiverpool on course for historyManchester City 2-3 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp 'over the moon' with 'incredible' RedsLiverpool's win keeps them in contention to make history - as no team in English football has won the league title, the two main domestic cup competitions and become champions of Europe in the same season. This was a win built on the foundation of a first half in which their intensity and ruthlessness proved too much for City, whose revamped side looked off the pace and unable to cope with the power of Klopp's side. Konate's power in the air saw him score his third header in his past three starts and Mane's alertness was never going to allow Steffen to get away with his hesitation as he attempted to keep possession in the six-yard area. Ederson had the calmness and expertise to escape almost on his goal-line as Diogo Jota bore down on him during last Sunday's 2-2 draw at Etihad Stadium but Steffen showed no such expertise or composure, and paid a heavy price as he was caught.Mane led the Liverpool charge while Thiago was imperious in midfield, his clever pass allowing Mane to volley past Steffen at his near post in the closing moments of the first half for what eventually proved to be the winner. Klopp was elated with his team's performance at the conclusion, although he will have concerns about how they allowed City back into the game through Grealish's goal, conceded two clear chances to Jesus then had to survive the anxiety of four minutes of stoppage time after Silva struck. In the final reckoning, however, Liverpool deserved to reach the final and will present a formidable barrier to either Chelsea or Crystal Palace once the winner of the second semi-final is decided. Man City too late to the partyManchester City 2-3 Liverpool: City performed with a lot of pride - GuardiolaThis was not a good day for Manchester City. It started with a section of their support chanting through the minute's silence to commemorate the anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, with City issuing a formal apology to Liverpool after the match had started. In the football context, Guardiola and City were left to regret injuries, a team selection that did not work out and a horribly laboured first 45 minutes that left them with too much to do, despite the brief hope offered by Silva's second goal. City missed the invention of De Bruyne, only fit enough for the bench after suffering an injury in the stormy Champions Leaque quarter-final against Atletico Madrid, and the experience of defender Walker, who was ruled out completely. And Guardiola's loyalty to Steffen as his FA Cup keeper was not rewarded as the American made that crucial error that allowed Liverpool to build on their fast start. Guardiola will be disappointed but this is a quality side who will now refocus and set sights on the Premier League, where they lead Liverpool by one point, and the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid. He will hope to have De Bruyne and Walker back fully fit soon because, despite this loss, there is still so much at stake for Guardiola and Manchester City as they remain in a position to achieve stellar things this season.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61120882
460,Crystal Palace 4-0 Everton: Eagles fly past Toffees to reach FA Cup last four,SUN 20 Mar 2022,fa-cup,"Watch Crystal Palace thrash Everton to progress to FA Cup semi-finalsCrystal Palace boss Patrick Vieira says the club is enjoying an ""exciting period"" after booking their place in the FA Cup semi-finals with a dominant 4-0 win over Everton at Selhurst Park.First-half goals from Marc Guehi and Jean-Philippe Mateta put them in full control before Wilfried Zaha and Will Hughes secured the win, as the hosts' verve and attacking purpose overpowered a poor Toffees side.""Going to Wembley is fantastic,"" Vieira told ITV after the game. ""You can hear the atmosphere in the stadium, the fans; this is what they wanted and we wanted to give it to them. ""They've been fantastic in getting behind the team. It is just a step forward; there is a long way to go. This is an exciting period for us, we will enjoy it and we will enjoy today.""Palace will meet Chelsea, who beat Middlesbrough on Saturday, for a place in the final.Such a heavy defeat for Everton looked unlikely as they made a ferocious start, almost taking the lead inside the first minute through Michael Keane before Richarlison tangled with Guehi but was ruled to be offside.Vieira admitted his side were under pressure from the start, but said not conceding an early goal was key to the result.""We went through difficult times in the game, especially the first 15 or 20 minutes. But we didn't concede; when we scored first, we started to believe more and managed to win the game.""The crucial point was the first 15 minutes because they were on top of us; they had momentum. ""We showed maturity because we went longer and played for the second ball - it got us into the game.""After Everton's Andros Townsend was forced off with an injury, the hosts settled down and Guehi put them ahead on 25 minutes with a powerful header from Michael Olise's pinpoint corner. Everton's poor marking almost cost them again moments later as Zaha got across Godfrey to meet Mateta's byeline cross, only to fire narrowly wide.With half-time looming, Palace made it 2-0. Eberechi Eze combined with Zaha, who reversed roles with Mateta, crossing low for the striker to finish emphatically past Jordan Pickford.Striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin was summoned at half-time by Everton, but there was no immediate upturn in fortune for Frank Lampard's side, who lacked ideas and energy. Zaha made the result sure 11 minutes from time, slamming home the rebound after Olise's looped shot came back off the post.And, after a VAR check for handball, Hughes compounded Everton's misery with a close-range finish in the closing stages.Zaha no longer the only star at PalaceThere was a time when Palace needed Zaha to shine if they were to get a result, but this was another great example of Patrick Vieira's side now having plentiful routes to victory.The Ivorian played his part with an assist and a late goal, but there was also much creativity on show in the final third from Eze, who has recently returned from a long-term injury, and Olise.Conor Gallagher put in another superb performance, dictating the play against an Everton side with no ideas in response. Whoever meets Palace at Wembley will face a tough task.Toffees come unstuck againIf Thursday's victory over Newcastle offered hope of a late-season revival for Everton, Sunday was a stark reminder of why they have struggled so much.Their good start needed to lead somewhere, and the fact that a break in play stunted their rhythm to such a degree shows just how fragile their confidence is.Calvert-Lewin is not yet fully fit, but he was unable to make a difference after his introduction.

461,Southampton 1-4 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola's side into FA Cup semi-finals,SUN 20 Mar 2022,fa-cup,"Watch as Manchester City win 4-1 in their FA Cup quarter-final against SouthamptonManchester City boss Pep Guardiola says not many players in world football could have scored Phil Foden's goal in the 4-1 win at Southampton.The Saints were in contention for more than an hour in a tight encounter at St Mary's after Aymeric Laporte's own goal on the stroke of half-time cancelled out Raheem Sterling's early effort. This FA Cup quarter-final turned on Mohammed Salisu's reckless challenge on Gabriel Jesus that saw Kevin de Bruyne restore City's lead from the penalty spot after 62 minutes, effectively ending Southampton's challenge. Foden came off the bench to score a magnificent third and Riyad Mahrez rounded the afternoon off with 12 minutes left.Guardiola claimed Foden and Mahrez made the difference in breaking down a brave Southampton side.Speaking about the 21-year-old England international's goal, the City boss said: ""A few, there are not many but a few, he is one of them who has [the ability to score from there].""He has an incredible shot, he's quick, fast, he's a fantastic player - we know it. Close to the box he has a sense of goal, he was really brilliant.""It was a tight game, it was [like] in the Premier League games against Southampton because of the quality they have. They are incredibly organised and in front of the ball they are so aggressive and of course have a good build-up.""But after 2-1, the second half we were much much better and in the end the quality from Phil and Riyad made the difference.""City will face Liverpool for a place in the final, while Chelsea take on Crystal Palace in the other semi-final.Man City get the job doneManchester City ran out emphatic winners but until Salisu's needless intervention that resulted in De Bruyne's penalty they were threatening to pay a price for carelessness in possession. Once De Bruyne had scored, however, City showed the quality and ruthlessness that has put them at the top of the Premier League and still in contention for the FA Cup and Champions League. Manager Pep Guardiola can also introduce such strength off the bench, illustrated by the contributions from Foden and Mahrez. Foden's 75th-minute goal was a thing of beauty, a rising drive from 20 yards that made a sweet thudding sounded that echoed around St Mary's once he struck with his left foot. Mahrez scored one goal and could have had more but once again the great orchestrator was man-of-the-match De Bruyne, pulling the strings and stepping forward to beat Fraser Forster with a penalty that put City back in charge. The fact that City can win so convincingly without touching the heights they are capable of will sound an ominous warning to anyone wanting to deprive them of any of those three major prizes they will contest between now and the end of the season. Saints undone by Salisu challengeSouthampton were giving as good as they were getting until Salisu's unnecessary tackle on Jesus, hardly in a dangerous position and with the game in the balance.City gratefully accepted the gift and a vibrant atmosphere inside a packed St Mary's was instantly subdued as if both Southampton's players and fans sensed this was the decisive moment. And so it proved as City took advantage of deflated Saints, who had played with so much energy and deserved so much credit for that first 62 minutes, even hitting the post through Adam Armstrong at 0-0. The high-intensity style that has made them such difficult opponents for so many teams this season was rushing City into errors in possession, one of which required a fine save from keeper Zack Steffen moments before De Bruyne put the visitors back in front. Saints might even have scored a second equaliser when substitute Che Adams' point-blank effort was blocked by Steffen but this was an FA Cup quarter-final that had its destiny decided by Salisu's challenge. This is not to say Southampton would have gone on to win but that incident changed the emphasis of the tie and Ralph Hasenhuttl's team had handed the initiative back to Manchester City, never the best of ideas. Saints have contributed much to the FA Cup this season but all that remains now is for them to continue to ensure Premier League respectability and consolidation in a season that has contained plenty of promise.

462,Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp's side set up semi-final date against Man City after edging past hosts,SUN 20 Mar 2022,fa-cup,"FA Cup highlights: Late Diogo Jota goal helps Liverpool edge past Nottingham ForestLiverpool will play Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley after edging past Nottingham Forest in a pulsating encounter at the City Ground.Diogo Jota scored the only goal of the game for the visitors, prodding in Konstantinos Tsimikas' cross from the left with 12 minutes remaining. Jurgen Klopp's quadruple-chasing side dominated possession but were made to work for their victory by their relentless Championship opponents. Steve Cooper's side saw a late penalty appeal turned down by VAR when midfielder Ryan Yates fell after a challenge with Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson. The hosts also regarded Philip Zinckernagel's miss as decisive to the outcome, the Danish winger side-footing wide from six yards from Brennan Johnson's inviting cross just a couple of minutes before Jota's goal.""I think the game was decided on a defining two minutes - we had a good chance that we didn't take and they created one and did,"" said Cooper.While Forest had already beaten both Arsenal and Leicester in this season's competition, they found themselves taking a significant step up in class against Liverpool despite Klopp making seven changes to his starting XI. And while they were galvanised by the electric atmosphere in what was the first meeting between the clubs in the FA Cup since the rescheduled 1989 semi-final that followed the Hillsborough disaster, they spent long periods of the game under severe pressure.Yates also had a chance to head a late equaliser, but Liverpool, who also carved open several excellent opportunities of their own, deservedly advanced to the last four.Nottingham Forest left 97 seats vacant for game with Liverpool to honour those who lost their lives because of the Hillsborough disaster.Relive Sunday's FA Cup actionFootball Daily podcast: Liverpool pass quarter-final test to continue quadruple quest Polished Liverpool maintain momentumWhile Forest made an encouraging start despite the absence of three first-choice defenders, Liverpool's Premier League pedigree quickly became evident. The visitors' slick movement repeatedly caused problems as did the hosts' own attempts to play out from the back. And had Roberto Firmino not fluffed a golden chance to open the scoring, Klopp's side would have headed into the interval with a deserved advantage and possibly having laid the platform for a more convincing performance.Instead the Brazilian's attempted dink was well saved by Forest goalkeeper Ethan Horvath, who bailed out his team after Jack Colback's glaring mistake. ""It was the game we expected, especially if you don't use your chances,"" said Klopp.""We could have played better, but we should have scored in the first half. If we scored earlier it would be a completely different game. Everything was prepared to give us a knock as well but because we were prepared for a fight we came through.""Reinforcements were summoned just after the hour mark with Jordan Henderson, Thiago, Takumi Minamino and Luis Diaz all introduced to try and turn the contest in Liverpool's favour.But having survived a scare at one end of the pitch it was Jota who made the difference with his 19th goal of the campaign - his best ever return in front of goal in a single season.And it ensured that Liverpool reached the semi-final of the competition for the first time under Klopp and maintained their superb domestic form which has seen them win 13 consecutive games plus the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea after a penalty shootout.Forest turn focus to promotionForest were bottom of the Championship when Cooper took charge in September and the former England Under-17s boss has since overseen a significant upturn in fortunes. This was only Forest's second defeat since the turn of the year and, while they will take heart from pushing one of Europe's elite clubs so close, they can now focus all of their attention on trying to join Liverpool in the Premier League next term.

463,Middlesbrough 0-2 Chelsea: Blues beat Championship side to reach FA Cup semi-finals,SAT 19 Mar 2022,fa-cup,"FA Cup: Chelsea win at Middlesbrough to reach semi-finalsRomelu Lukaku scored his 12th goal of the season as Chelsea beat Championship side Middlesbrough to reach the FA Cup semi-finals.Middlesbrough had knocked out Manchester United and Tottenham on their way to the quarter-finals but their hopes of claiming another Premier League victim were dealt an early blow when Lukaku tapped in from Mason Mount's cross after a quick Chelsea counter.Hakim Ziyech made it 2-0 midway through the first half with a superb dipping effort from the edge of the box before Lukaku was denied a second when Anfernee Dijksteel cleared off the line.Middlesbrough showed plenty of endeavour in the second half as they looked to mount an unlikely comeback, with Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun shooting wide after a promising counter, while Duncan Watmore also sent an effort over the bar from a good position.However, Chelsea could have grabbed a late third when substitute Timo Werner met a free-kick but Middlesbrough goalkeeper Joe Lumley did well to palm away.Chelsea will find out who they will play in the semi-finals, which will be played at Wembley on 16 and 17 April, when the draw is made before Sunday's quarter-final between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool (18:00 GMT).Chelsea cannot show self pity - TuchelChelsea's run continues despite uncertainty There had been a bit of needle before this game with Chelsea having had to make an awkward U-turn over their request for the game to be played behind closed doors for ""sporting integrity"". The club were unable to sell their entire 4,500 ticket allocation for the fixture because of sanctions that have been imposed by the government on Russian owner Roman Abramovich because of his connection to Russian President Vladimir Putin.It meant they were backed by around 700 supporters who had got their tickets before the sanctions were brought in, while Middlesbrough were cheered on by a sell-out crowd at the 34,000 capacity Riverside Stadium. Chelsea players have responded well amid the uncertainty surrounding the club off the pitch. They had been unsure if they would have a 10-hour round trip by coach to get to Middlesbrough just hours after returning from a Champions League tie in Lille because of financial constraints.Since Abramovich had his assets frozen on 10 March as part of sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Chelsea have won all three games they have played and this was an ultimately routine victory against a side who have performed well against Premier League opponents in this year's FA Cup.Lukaku has endured a difficult campaign in which he has not looked completely happy at Chelsea but he was handed a start in this game. And he made a key contribution, opening the scoring for a third FA Cup goal in four games, making an important clearance from a Marcus Tavernier free-kick with the score 1-0, and was denied a second only by a goalline clearance.The Belgian's celebration of his goal was muted, doing little to quash speculation about his long-term future, but he did what he was asked to do as Chelsea kept alive their hopes of a ninth FA Cup title.Boro switch focus to Premier League returnIt has been an excellent run in the FA Cup by Middlesbrough, who have been rejuvenated since Chris Wilder took charge on 7 November.They started this game well and were not afraid to press high against a side who had won seven of their last eight games. Ultimately, that bold start proved costly as they were caught on the counter for the opener but their run in the competition and their performances against Premier League opposition will give them confidence as they now switch focus to joining their recent FA Cup opposition in the top flight next season.Middlesbrough are eighth in the Championship, two points off sixth but with two games in hand over most of those above them.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60698095

The striker was convinced the goal should have stood, but with no VAR it was, controversially, chalked off.Lees then headed home in the 13th minute for Huddersfield, who made six changes from the side that beat Peterborough 3-0 in the league last Friday.It followed an unusual set-piece routine, where the players hung around at the back post before the corner was swung into the near post and Lees advanced to score with an emphatic header.Surridge, who joined Forest from Stoke on transfer deadline day last month, got justice and his first goal for the club in the 29th minute when he fired a powerful shot past Jamal Blackman in the visiting goal.Yates then connected with James Garner's free-kick to turn things around and give Forest the lead eight minutes before half-time.Jordan Rhodes' entrance off the bench sparked Huddersfield for a late push as Danny Ward saw two efforts well saved by Ethan Horvath.But Forest had great chances of their own and Manchester United loanee Garner and Djed Spence were wasteful with two of them.Huddersfield, who have not made the quarter-finals since 1972, were on an 18-game unbeaten run across all competitions and had knocked out Premier League Burnley in the third round.Although the prospect of a meeting with Liverpool was the big prize at stake, both sides are also pushing for promotion to the top flight.Forest are ninth - three points off the play-offs - and Huddersfield in second spot, so this was always going to be a hard-fought battle.Steve Cooper's side edged it in the end and will have no fear about facing Jurgen Klopp's men on 20 March at the City Ground, having already seen off Arsenal in round three and thrashed holders Leicester 4-1 in the fourth round.Forest are one of two Championship clubs left in the competition, with Middlesbrough hosting European champions Chelsea in a game to be shown live on BBC Sport.'Yates is a diamond to be honest'Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper, speaking to ITV4: ""I though it was a great cup tie and I thought we had an excellent first half.

466,Luton Town 2-3 Chelsea: Romelu Lukaku scores Blues winner in FA Cup,WED 02 Mar 2022,fa-cup,"FA Cup Highlights: Luton 2-3 ChelseaChelsea survived a scare against Championship side Luton Town to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals in a tie overshadowed by owner Roman Abramovich's decision to sell the Stamford Bridge club. Abramovich made the announcement an hour before kick-off after growing speculation he would put Chelsea up for sale following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Chelsea's players were unaware of the developments before Abramovich made them public in his statement, and Reece Burke made their night more uncomfortable when he put the Hatters in front with a header following a corner after only two minutes. Luton lost goalkeeper Jed Steer to an ankle injury after only 14 minutes, and Chelsea were level before his replacement Harry Isted had been on the field that long - with Saul Niguez steering home a cool finish.Harry Cornick raced clear to restore Luton's lead before half-time but Chelsea turned up the pressure after the break to prevail despite an unconvincing performance. Timo Werner finished coolly after collecting Ruben Loftus-Cheek's long pass in the 68th minute, then crossed for Romelu Lukaku to slide in and put Chelsea ahead for the first time 10 minutes later. Follow Wednesday's FA Cup action liveChelsea make hard work of itConfirmation Abramovich was leaving Chelsea was the talk of Kenilworth Road before, during and after a highly eventful FA Cup tie.It was a hugely significant moment in the club's history, even though there was an air of inevitability given events in Ukraine.Whether or not the news was still sinking in with Chelsea's players, they made the most sluggish of starts and were behind inside two minutes against a lively Luton side.Manager Thomas Tuchel had rung the chances after defeat on penalties by Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday - even giving Kenedy his first start for the club in 1,505 days. 'He's got his goal' - Lukaku puts Chelsea ahead LutonAnd it showed as they struggled for rhythm, even after Saul's equaliser - falling behind once more before Werner and Lukaku saw them through. Those goals should be a confidence boost for both strikers given their struggles to establish themselves, and Tuchel needed them with Chelsea in trouble against lower-division opposition. This night, however, was all about the plots and sub-plots surrounding Abramovich's departure, whenever that will be, and the mood of Chelsea's players at the final whistle was one of relief rather than celebration.Luton deserve huge creditCornick's cool finish puts Luton ahead against Chelsea for second timeThis was a throwback to Luton's better days in the top flight as a packed, compact Kenilworth Road carried all the ingredients for an FA Cup shock.And Nathan Jones' Hatters did their best to provide it as they took Chelsea all the way, leading twice before running out of steam and falling to their visitors' greater quality. Luton showed why they are in the Championship play-off places as they performed with real verve and energy that bodes well as they push for promotion to the Premier League.There will be disappointment in defeat but also great credit because they matched their opponents for long periods, even threatening a shock until Werner and Lukaku stepped up to rescue Chelsea.

Referee Andre Marriner initially missed it but gave the spot-kick after watching the incident on the VAR monitor.""Making nine changes doesn't mean that we're not looking for this cup,"" Hasenhuttl told BBC Sport. ""It's a super opportunity for us. But we shouldn't forget these players have brought us here.""You can't speak about having a big squad and trusting everyone and not show the right signals.

""He looked extremely sharp. He showed all of the things he knows for sure he has in him. It was a complete performance. ""The two goals were great but all the rest he did was top class as well.""Minamino had scored four goals in five EFL Cup games for Liverpool this season but was left out of the starting XI for the final.Asked if he would have been disappointed by that, Klopp added: ""It was disappointing, I can imagine. ""How he is, I don't think that is the reason why he played so good tonight. He isn't the kind of person for this sort of anger. ""Takumi was a massive part of the whole journey. Not playing in the final might have been hard in the moment but in the long term, he can look back [on the fact] that he won the League Cup and that can be a good thing.""Takumi Minamino has scored nine goals this season with seven of those coming in cup competitionsIt was not a straightforward win for Liverpool as Norwich showed fight late on, giving their impressive away following hope when Lukas Rupp found himself in space to thump a fierce shot beyond Alisson. The Liverpool goalkeeper then pushed over a powerful Jonathan Rowe strike as Norwich pressed but the hosts held on to secure their passage into the last eight.Klopp's side have now beaten Norwich four times this season - home and away in the Premier League and in the EFL Cup third round, along with Wednesday's win.It is also the first time in the Reds' history that they have beaten the same team four times in a single campaign.""I thought the team who deserved to go through went through,"" Norwich boss Dean Smith told BBC Sport.""But we asked enough questions of them. We created chances. A lot of players who haven't had many minutes have come in and done exceptionally well. That'll help us picking the team.""Reaction to Wednesday's FA Cup gamesFA Cup progress paving the way for quadruple?Victory in Sunday's EFL Cup final means an unprecedented quadruple - winning the Champions League, Premier League and two domestic cups - remains a possibility for Liverpool.The Reds have a 2-0 lead over Inter Milan from the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie and are six points behind Manchester City in the title race but winning the lot is something Klopp has, understandably, played down.No English club has ever managed the feat. City came close in 2019 after winning a domestic treble but they were beaten by Tottenham in the quarter-final of that season's Champions League.But while Klopp may play down a clean sweep of trophies, he will nevertheless be keen to win at least the FA Cup, given that it is a trophy that has so far eluded him and Wednesday marked the first time he had taken the Reds beyond the fifth round.Squad depth is going to be key to the Reds' hopes of challenging for multiple trophies and Minamino's display underlined just how much talent they have.With Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Diogo Jota and new signing Luis Diaz, the Reds have a plethora of attacking options - but despite that, Minamino has played his part this season.Asked about how important squad depth has been for Liverpool's form this season, Klopp said: ""That's the reason for the situation we are in. We have this kind of mentality and character in the squad. ""It is exactly what we need to be successful in the long term. That is the quality we need and the boys have to be ready.

However, Omoijuanfo struck five minutes from time to give Norway the win.Stephen Kenny's Republic side round out 2022 with Sunday's friendly away to Malta.This week's friendlies against the Norwegians and Malta offer Kenny a chance to assess his squad before the start of the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign in March. He opted to make four changes from September's Nations League win over Armenia, recalling Josh Cullen, Callum Robinson, Callum O'Dowda and Browne to his side, and may be tempted to dip deeper into his squad for Sunday's trip to Malta.Drab first halfWhile O'Dowda looked bright at left wing-back and Robinson fired over early on, the Republic lacked a cutting edge with Norway keeper Orjan Nyland largely untroubled during the first half. The Republic were unable to fashion a chance from any of their three corners in the opening 45 minutes, but Norway showed their own threat from set-pieces when Ostigard shook off John Egan and powerfully headed Odegaard's corner past Gavin Bazunu. Having not had much to shout about in the first half, the Republic fans came alive after the break as the hosts' urgency for an equaliser produced a string of chances. The Republic thought they had earned a draw thanks to Alan Browne's fine strikeEgan poked a Robinson cross just wide moments before Norway defender Morten Thorsby nearly turned a Michael Obafemi pass into his own net. From the resulting corner, Nyland produced a sharp save to deny Browne after Norway had only half-cleared the set-piece, before O'Dowda headed straight at the away side's keeper after being picked out by Josh Cullen's superb diagonal pass.However, the Republic got their goal when Browne hammered a superb drive into the bottom corner to cap the home side's best spell in the match. With the crowd coming alive in the second half, there was a sense that the Irish would press for the winner after gaining the momentum.However, it was Norway who were celebrating in the closing stages when substitute striker Omoijuanfo pounced to fire underneath Bazunu after Nathan Collins had failed to clear a cross into the box. 'Really poor to concede from two set-pieces'Goalscorer Alan Browne was disappointed that the Republic conceded from two set-pieces on a night when they were hoping to give the Dublin crowd a positive result.""I think they nullified us very well, they were really compact,"" he told Sky Sports.""It's really poor from our point of view, to concede from two set-pieces is really not like us. We need to look at that and improve on that. ""We found it hard to break them down, there was no real zip to our game, we were a bit flat. The second half was definitely better but there is a lot more room for improvement. ""We wanted to put on a performance for the fans and get the win but ultimately we did neither. I did think we were the better team in the second half but it is utterly disappointing to concede another set-piece. ""It was just a stroke of luck in the box [for the Norway winner], it fell nicely for him. It was unfortunate for us but we need to learn from that and improve on it.""

474,Turkey 2-1 Scotland: John McGinn's goal mere consolation after ragged display,WED 16 Nov 2022,international-friendlies,"Turkey game 'showed depth of Scotland squad' - Steve ClarkeScotland conceded soft goals either side of the break to slip to a friendly defeat against Turkey in Diyarbakir.It was a just third loss in 16 for Steve Clarke's side, who looked shaky defensively in the first meeting of these nations in 62 years.Ozan Kabak got between two defenders to head in a free-kick, before Cengiz Under finished a smart break after Stuart Armstrong coughed up possession.John McGinn gave the Scots hope but his stunning strike was mere consolation.Indeed, for all that the visitors rallied and might have had a penalty when Lyndon Dykes was wrestled in the box, the Turks could have been out of sight before then.Ranked five places behind Scotland in 45th spot, they struck the frame of the goal and were denied on several occasions by Craig Gordon on his 700th senior appearance.'Some things worked, some didn't' in Scotland lossRobertson predicts big future for RamsayReaction & as it happenedOne bright spot for the Scots was a debut for Liverpool's 19-year-old right-back Calvin Ramsay, who Clarke opted not to use from the start. Instead, the head coach went with a tried and trusted line-up perhaps in recognition of the test that lay before them. His players wilted under that examination and arguably escaped with a lenient outcome, albeit they did rally as the game wore on.The intensity of the boisterous home crowd in the first-ever international in Diyarbikar, was matched by the quality of the men in red. It meant a lot and that was reflected on the pitch.John McGinn's goal was mere consolation for ScotlandFrom the outset, Turkey went at Scotland's backline. Captain Hakan Calhanoglu had an early shot parried by Gordon and the Inter Milan playmaker was instrumental, particularly in the first half, with another of his efforts diverted by the goalkeeper's legs.Scotland hung on and did have a decent chance when Armstrong sent a lovely ball across the six-yard box that just evaded Dykes, but further scares would follow when Andy Robertson diverted an effort over his own bar and Kabak cracked a header off the bar from the consequent corner.And Kabak would soon break through from another set-piece, rising unchallenged to angle his header from a Calhanoglu delivery across Gordon. Defensively, Scotland looked ill at ease. They were almost caught out again from a simple diagonal ball but Gordon thwarted Samet Akaydin, so it felt almost like a relief that they reached the break just one behind.  That status didn't last long, though. Armstrong might have slipped in Robertson when in possession on the edge of the Turkey box but was robbed and Under raced away before jabbing a sublime finish through Scott McKenna's legs and away from Gordon.The game looked gone, but from nowhere McGinn burst forward, rode a challenge and thumped an excellent strike into the far corner. It was his 15th international goal - tied with James McFadden - and suddenly Scotland looked reborn.Clarke's side had a double penalty shout waved away when Dykes and McKenna appeared to be manhandled while trying to meet a deep delivery and Hendry connected with another ball at the back post but was off target.Substitute Ryan Christie came close, too, but his angled shot after an excellent move flew over.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63564471

479,Argentina 5-0 Estonia: Lionel Messi scores five times in friendly win,SUN 05 Jun 2022,international-friendlies,"Lionel Messi moved up to fourth in the all-time scoring charts in men's international footballLionel Messi scored all five of Argentina's goals as they continued their fine form by thrashing Estonia in a friendly in Pamplona, Spain.The Argentines swept aside Italy 3-0 in the Finalissima - a game between the champions of Europe and South America - on Wednesday.Messi provided two assists in that game and he was once again in vintage form.He opened the scoring with a penalty and his fourth moved him above Ferenc Puskas who scored 84 goals for Hungary.Messi is now the fourth highest-scorer in men's international football, behind only Malaysia's Mokhtar Dahari (89), Iran's Ali Daei (109) and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo (117).It is the first time the 34-year-old has scored five in a game for his country. In fact, he has only ever achieved the feat once before in his career, in a 7-1 win for Barcelona over Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League in 2012.He would have been closer still to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese scored twice in his country's Nations League win against Switzerland on Sunday.Messi's goals in Pamplona demonstrated his vast array of skills.He put Lionel Scaloni's team ahead with a calm penalty after eight minutes, then doubled the lead with a powerful side-footed effort into the roof of the net from a tight angle.His third was a predatory finish, showing his trademark precision to direct Nahuel Molina's right-wing cross into the bottom corner from 12 yards.His fourth owed much to his alertness. As other players stopped and anticipated a free-kick award that never came, Messi picked up a loose ball, drove into the box, produced a dummy which left the Estonia keeper and a defender lying on the ground and rolled the ball into the empty net.He concluded his remarkable performance when he was again quickest to react to a loose ball and slotted in a low finish from next to the penalty spot with 14 minutes remaining.While Estonia did not provide the sternest of tests, this result - coupled with the victory over Italy, their unbeaten World Cup qualifying campaign and last year's Copa America triumph - suggests Messi could yet have a great chance of winning the World Cup, the one trophy that has eluded him in his glittering career.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61700518

It was a lovely feeling.""Joakim Maehle and Jesper Lindstrom also scored for Denmark as Eriksen grabbed his country's third with a fine strike from 22 yards in the 57th minute in the friendly victory.Danish fans held up a banner before the game that said 'Welcome back Christian''Welcome back Christian'Eriksen was back at the venue where he nearly lost his life 290 days ago.In the first half of that match against Finland, and with no players around him, Eriksen collapsed having suffered cardiac arrest.Team-mates and medics rushed to help him before he was revived and taken to hospital, with Eriksen later saying he had ""died for five minutes"".He was subsequently fitted with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) - a type of pacemaker - so he could continue his career.However, he had to leave his club Inter Milan as players with an ICD device are not allowed to play in Italy's Serie A, before the former Tottenham midfielder returned to the Premier League with Brentford.He came on and scored during Denmark's 4-2 defeat by Netherlands on Saturday and was greeted by a rousing reception from the Danish fans in Copenhagen on Tuesday with a banner reading 'Welcome back Christian'.Eriksen was involved in the build-up to Denmark's first goal as his left-wing corner was only partially headed clear with Maehle firing low into the net from 25 yards.Lindstrom added a second when free in the penalty area early in the second half, before Eriksen gave the fans the moment they wanted by scoring a well-taken goal four minutes later.Eriksen, who could feature for Denmark in the World Cup in Qatar later this year, received a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 79th minute.Christian Eriksen applauded the fans at Parken Stadium before the matchEriksen was named Denmark captain for the gameEriksen scored Denmark's third goal in the 57th minute",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60901275

482,Austria 2-2 Scotland: Steve Clarke says his side can 'look forward' despite losing two-goal lead,TUE 29 Mar 2022,international-friendlies,"Club Bruges centre-back Jack Hendry bundled in the opening goal for ScotlandScotland head coach Steve Clarke says his side can ""look forward"" after extending their unbeaten run to eight games, despite spurning a two-goal lead in a late friendly collapse in Austria.Jack Hendry's first-half header was followed by John McGinn finishing off a fine free-flowing move in Vienna.But Michael Gregoritsch's header pulled one back for Austria before Alessandro Schopf's quickfire second levelled. ""We'll take the draw and go eight unbeaten,"" Clarke said post-match.""From 2-0 it's always a little bit disappointing to not see out a win, but it's a tough place to come. Austria were competitive and they wanted to give their manager a good send-off.""Following Thursday's late draw with Poland, it is six wins in eight games for Clarke's men.The Scots are due to return to action in June when the domestic campaign draws to a close, with a quartet of Nations League games currently scheduled to be played over a 10-day period.The World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine and a potential final are also due to be rearranged for that month, but it remains to be seen whether they will replace or add to the four games already in the calendar.""Hopefully we are playing Ukraine, that's my one wish,"" Clarke added. ""If we are playing them in June that means the situation there has improved dramatically and that will be great for everyone.""Reaction & as it happenedIt could have been the night Scotland booked their place at a World Cup for the first time this century. If your glass is half empty, it could have been another night of heartbreak.Instead, a subdued Ernst-Happel-Stadion, where the Austrian support looked outnumbered by the travelling Tartan Army, played host to what turned out to be an entertaining friendly. For certain, the home fans were drowned out audibly by the visiting Scots as they watched their side break forward on the counter, resulting in Stuart Armstrong crossing for McGinn, who smashed a volley into the arms of Daniel Bachmann early on.Craig Gordon added to his showreel of fine Scotland saves up the other end to deny Sasa Kalajdzic twice, first extending his left arm to stop a header before thwarting the Stuttgart forward at his near post with his feet.Both chances came either side of another Scotland breakaway, with Armstrong again providing McGinn. This time, the Aston Villa man clipped a close-range effort past the far post when passing across goal to Che Adams looked the better option.Austria, looking to give departing boss Franco Foda a positive send off in his final game in charge, were the more likely as Gordon bettered his previous two stops to prevent Marko Arnautovic bursting the net with a first-time strike.But the Scots were always a danger on the transition as a driving run and fantastic pass from Andy Robertson led to Adams' deflected effort hitting the side netting.The following set-piece brought the opener. Hendry bravely nodded in a rebound after McGinn's inswinging cross was headed off the bar by Grant Hanley - a second Scotland goal for the Club Bruges defender.While Gordon was in inspired form, a more clinical attack would have made Scotland pay in the first half as RB Leipzig midfielder Konrad Laimer drilled wide from the edge of the area with the goal gaping.Scotland looked a more resolute unit at the start of the second period and doubled their advantage when a fantastic team move ended with Kieran Tierney pulling the ball back for McGinn to smash into the roof of the net.But Clarke's backline began to creak again when Gregoritsch's glancing header to the far post reduced the deficit.Bayern Munich's Marcel Sabitzer then drilled a shot wide, but Schopf made no mistake from similar range, guiding a low shot from the edge of the area past a rooted Gordon.On another fantastic international display, the Hearts keeper had one more vital intervention to make, racing out to deny Andreas Weimann.Friendly or not, that save could prove to be crucial for morale as it ensured the away side's unbeaten run rolls on into June.Man of the match - Craig GordonWith so much hype surrounding Scotland's young talent, the 39-year-old again proved how much he has to offer between the sticks in another standout performanceWhat did we learn?Scotland's World Cup qualifying win in Vienna six months ago, a turning point in their campaign, was viewed as seismic. Now, it is the standard.For that reason, coupled with how late both goals came, this result will sting, regardless of the importance of the fixture.Crucially, the eight-game unbeaten run will carry on to June, when Scotland are expected to play their rearranged play-off semi-final with Ukraine - a potential career-defining game for these players.Only between October 2019 and November 2020 have the national team enjoyed a longer unbeaten streak under Clarke, and spirit in the camp will remain high when the squad regroup in the summer.What's next?Scotland are scheduled to return to action in June, beginning their Nations League campaign with a quartet of games over 10 days. Two fixtures against Armenia bookend a home match against Ukraine and a trip to the Republic of Ireland - but there is also a play-off semi-final against the Ukrainians to rearrange, with a potential final against Wales to come.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60874723

The hosts were well in control and leading through Ollie Watkins' close-range finish, before former Tottenham defender Serge Aurier's dismissal - when he was shown a second yellow card for dissent - five minutes before the break. ‘It’s ridiculous’ – Southgate and Grealish on England fans booing MaguireRaheem Sterling, captain for the night and creator of Watkins' 30th-minute opener, made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time, effectively ending the game as a contest. Defender Tyrone Mings' injury-time header completed the formalities.Booing Maguire an 'absolute joke', says England boss SouthgateHas Bellingham made himself an England starter?Reaction to England's win over Ivory CoastBellingham stakes his claimSouthgate made 10 changes from the side that came from behind to beat Switzerland 2-1, giving a start to Bellingham in the number 10 role. And how the Dortmund player, who is not 19 until June, revelled in the responsibility with yet another astonishingly mature display that simply confirmed once more how comfortable he is at international level. Bellingham has already proved his class and quality for England, as well as his club in both the Bundesliga and Champions League. The sky really is the limit for this richly-gifted youngster.England untroubled by the ElephantsIn the end, it was victory at a canter for England against an Ivory Coast side who delivered little in the way of attacking intent - and only produced several heavy challenges by way of resistance to the home side's superiority. James Ward-Prowse received warm applause when he was substituted after almost scoring with a trademark long-range strike, but Manchester United captain Harry Maguire did not receive the same reception from the Wembley crowd. England manager Southgate has kept faith with Maguire despite his abject form at club level but some of the home fans were less forgiving, with audible jeers greeting his name when it was read out before kick-off and also with his first touches. Other than that, it was a mercifully quiet night for centre-back Maguire who, despite those Old Trafford struggles, has rarely let England down. Harry Kane was restricted to a cameo as a second-half substitute so did not get the chance to claim a 50th England goal on his 69th appearance for his country. It was the sort of confident performance Southgate will have wanted, with the added bonus of giving his squad even more experience. Crystal Palace full-back Tyrick Mitchell was able to cruise through his first start following a debut against Switzerland. England now wait to hear their World Cup group opponents at Friday's draw in Qatar, before they return to action against Hungary in Budapest for June's Uefa Nations League encounter. The second half was very low-key once England had scored twice and the visitors went down to 10 men, but there was still plenty to please Southgate as he formulates and finalises his plans for when the World Cup action gets under way in November.

486,International friendly: Northern Ireland lose at home to Hungary despite late rally,TUE 29 Mar 2022,international-friendlies,"Northern Ireland's Niall McGinn gave the ball away for Hungary's goalNorthern Ireland fell to a disappointing 1-0 defeat at home to Hungary in a largely low-key friendly international in Belfast.A Niall McGinn error early in the second half led to Roland Sallai scoring what proved to be the winner, despite a late rally from the hosts.NI captain Steven Davis hit a post and McGinn had an effort well saved by Denes Dibusz in the first half.Dibusz also denied home substitute Dion Charles in injury time.The ball fell to the Bolton Wanderers striker in the six-yard box but, as he swivelled and shot, the visiting keeper made a fine block to ensure his side survived a final 10 minutes of extensive Northern Ireland pressure. Charles' close-range effort was the last last of a flurry of late chances for the hosts, with George Saville having a header saved just before young Sunderland full-back Trai Hume almost marked his debut with a memorable goal, but his header could also not beat Dibusz. On another night we could have had four goals - BaracloughHungary's crucial goal arrived in the 55th minute when experienced winger McGinn seemed to under-hit a backpass which allowed Sallai to get to the ball before goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell and take it round him before sliding into an empty net.The defeat follows Northern Ireland's 3-1 friendly win away to Luxembourg on Friday night and completes their preparations for their Nations League campaign, which begins at home to Greece on 2 June before a trip to Cyprus three days later. It also brings to an end a three-match unbeaten run that included a home victory over Lithuania and an impressive scoreless draw with Italy in World Cup qualifying before the Luxembourg victory.Fleetwood Town's Paddy Lane, 21, joined Hume in making his senior debut, starting the game on the left flank but struggling to make an impact, with Sunderland full-back Hume coming on as a late substitute just a few months after moving to the League One side from Linfield.  Baraclough tweaks system but NI fail to fireWith 3-5-2 having very much become Northern Ireland manager Baraclough's formation of choice, his side started this friendly in what looked more like a 3-4-3 shape, with McGinn and Gavin Whyte playing either side of Magennis in a front three.It meant 21-year-old debutant Lane playing on the left side of the middle four, with the ever-versatile Paddy McNair on the right, and captain Davis and Ali McCann in the middle.Lane, in the senior squad for the first time after impressing for the Under 21s, worked hard out wide but struggled to make any real impact going forward and spend most of the half tracking runners as the Hungarians looked to get in down their right hand side. It was a fairly drab opening half, with both sides enjoying decent possession but neither showing any great urgency - though the hosts did have the capacity crowd on their feet on two occasions as they came desperately close to opening the scoring.On 11 minutes, Rangers midfielder Davis - who moved into the top 100 all-time international appearance makers by winning his 134th cap - almost made the visitors pay when he latched on to a stray pass and, with goalkeeper Dibusz off his line, hit an audacious curler with the outside of his right foot that struck the outside of the post.McGinn nearly broke the deadlock four minutes before the interval after Whyte got on to a Magennis flick-on to feed him with a pass, but the winger's shot was tipped round the post.The second half brought a host of substitutions but it was only in the final 10 minutes that Northern Ireland showed any real urgency to produce those three big opportunities in the closing stages.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60830351
487,Republic of Ireland 1-0 Lithuania: Last-gasp Troy Parrott goal clinches friendly win,TUE 29 Mar 2022,international-friendlies,"Parrott rifled home a brilliant shot in the 97th minuteSubstitute Troy Parrott's superb strike, seven minutes into added time, lifted the Republic of Ireland to a 1-0 friendly win over Lithuania in Dublin. Parrott arrowed an unstoppable shot into the bottom corner with virtually the last kick of the game as the Irish backed up Saturday's draw against Belgium with a hard-fought win.The goal came after the Republic had four goals disallowed for offside. The result stretches the home side's unbeaten run to eight games. Parrott's piledriver was met with a mix of elation and relief as the 20-year-old forward, on loan at MK Dons from Tottenham, intervened to settle a game that had brought nothing but frustration for the Republic. Up against a deep and stubborn Lithuania defence, Stephen Kenny's side managed to put the ball in the back of the net on four occasions before the winner despite operating below the energetic levels that earned them a creditable 2-2 draw with Belgium. Chiedozie Ogbene was twice foiled by the linesman's flag while Conor Hourihane and Scott Hogan also had efforts ruled out. Parrott's stunning intervention will further boost the feelgood factor around this Irish team as Kenny prepares to switch focus to June's Nations League triple-header against Ukraine, Armenia and Scotland.Parrott responds to Kenny praise in styleDespite the fourth official's board having indicated five minutes added time, the clock had ticked into the 97th minute before Parrott popped up to devastating effect. After Lithuania half-cleared a Hourihane cross, the forward - who had earlier been denied by Lithuania keeper Dziugas Bartkus' flying save - took two touches, set himself and lashed a rasping effort into the bottom-left corner. It was Parrott's third international goal, his first at home, and it comes less than a week after Kenny praised the young striker for ""knuckling down"" at MK Dons following a difficult spell in his fledgling career. Long touted as a prospective Republic star after a string of excellent performances for the under-21s, Parrott's inability to break into the Tottenham first team saw him take in loan periods at Millwall and Ipswich before agreeing a season-long stint with MK Dons.With five goals for the League One side this season, his strike against Lithuania was a reminder of how clinical he can be, and will undoubtedly aid his quest to push himself into Kenny's starting line-up before the upcoming Nations League. Kenny last week praised Parrott's work ethic at MK Dons having failed to break through at TottenhamHaving held an understrength Belgium on Saturday, Kenny opted to rotate with six changes, including first starts for Wigan striker Keane and Burnley defender Nathan Collins. Another player brought in was Ryan Manning and the Swansea full-back made an early impact when he sprung down the left and crossed for Ogbene to fire home, but the forward's celebrations were cut short when the linesman raised his flag for offside. That close call failed to spark the Republic into life during a drab first half and their frustration deepened after the restart when Hourihane's effort was ruled out because Callum Robinson and Keane were standing in an offside position in front of Bartkus. Ogbene then had a second effort chalked off before Hogan's 95th-minute effort was ruled out.Tottenham full-back Doherty was dangerous throughout but missed three chances, while John Egan had a header saved, leaving the stage clear for Parrott to provide a spectacular conclusion to an otherwise forgettable friendly.

490,Wales 1-1 Czech Republic: Wayne Hennessey wins 100th cap in friendly draw,TUE 29 Mar 2022,international-friendlies,"Rubin Colwill (left) celebrates his first international goal with Rhys Norrington-DaviesWayne Hennessey celebrated 100 caps for Wales as their friendly with the Czech Republic ended in a draw in Cardiff.Tomas Soucek's fine swivelled strike put the Czechs ahead before Rubin Colwill finished a swift team move to instantly level for Wales.After a slow start, a much-changed Wales side created a flurry of second-half chances with Brennan Johnson impressing in attack.Hennessey was then given a standing ovation when he was substituted.The goalkeeper, who captained Wales for the night, also had his best friend in the squad Gareth Bale join in as the team's usual skipper made a late cameo appearance. After last Thursday's momentous World Cup play-off semi-final win over Austria, this friendly was always likely to feel a little anticlimactic. As Wales manager Robert Page said himself, the important game was done.But Hennessey's milestone at least gave the fixture some significance that would otherwise have been lacking.This was the evening when Wales were meant to be playing their play-off final against Scotland or Ukraine, but because of Russia's invasion that semi-final had been postponed.Wales instead arranged this fixture, with the Football Association of Wales donating profits from the game to the Disasters Emergency Committee Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal.With the footballing stakes so low, Page made 10 changes to the team that beat Austria. While Bale was benched and Aaron Ramsey left out of the squad entirely, Hennessey was the only player to retain his place in a starting line-up in which none of the players had scored an international goal.By contrast, the Czech Republic made only five changes from their 1-0 extra-time defeat against Sweden in Thursday's World Cup play-off semi-final.The visitors' greater experience and match sharpness showed in the opening exchanges as they controlled possession and created a handful of chances, with Jan Kuchta's header forcing Hennessey into an excellent save.Wales 1-1 Czech Republic: As it happened & reactionThe Czechs deservedly led after half an hour as captain and West Ham midfielder Soucek finished superbly with a first-time shot on the turn.But Wales were level just two minutes later as Johnson broke into the penalty area and pulled the ball back to Colwill, who did not break stride before side-footing into the bottom corner.The home side almost pinched another before half-time but Will Vaulks' low sliding effort from a Rabbi Matondo pass hit the base of the post.Ondrej Lingr had a goal disallowed for offside early in the second half but, after a slow start, Wales had several chances to lead.Wayne Hennessey is the third man to win 100 caps for Wales, following Gareth Bale and Chris GunterVaulks shot wide from 20 yards before Johnson darted into the box and shot narrowly wide. Chris Mepham then had a header blocked by Soucek before substitute goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik saved another effort from Johnson.The Nottingham Forest forward, who has lit up the Championship this season, was the most threatening attacking player on the pitch, constantly worrying the Czech defence with his pace, direct running and intelligence in the final third.Hennessey was given a standing ovation when he was replaced by Adam Davies after an hour and, as is often the case in friendlies, the match lost what impetus it had when both sides made a raft of substitutions.Bale made an appearance for the final 10 minutes, eager to share in the celebration of his old friend Hennessey's achievement. The Real Madrid forward tried his luck with a couple of audacious long-range strikes but both teams seemed content with the draw.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60874724

492,Republic of Ireland 2-2 Belgium: Late Alan Browne goal earns Republic draw in friendly,SAT 26 Mar 2022,international-friendlies,"Browne rose to meet Chiedozie Ogbene's cross and earn the Irish a draw against the world's top-ranked teamAlan Browne came off the bench to score a late equaliser and earn the Republic of Ireland a creditable friendly draw with world number one side Belgium. The visitors took the lead after 12 minutes through Michy Batshuayi.Chiedozie Ogbene levelled with a deflected bicycle kick before Belgium regained the lead when Hans Vanaken's header went in off Seamus Coleman. But Browne thumped a towering header past Simon Mignolet to earn the Irish a draw four minutes from time. Back in action for the first time since the end of the World Cup qualifying campaign in November, the Republic will feel they deservedly took something from the game as they stretched their unbeaten run to seven matches. With manager Roberto Martinez having only selected players with fewer than 50 caps, Belgium were missing Manchester City playmaker Kevin de Bruyne and Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku among others. However, the visitors showed how dangerous they can be without their star players when Batshuayi opened the scoring with a ruthless finish. Drifting out left to collect Vanaken's pass, the striker drove between Coleman and Matt Doherty and beat Caoimhin Kelleher with a curling right-foot effort.Given Belgium's early dominance the home fans had little to shout about, but boos rang around the stadium after 25 minutes when the visitors' bench featuring Thierry Henry was shown on the big screen, the France legend's handball having famously denied the Irish a place at the 2010 World Cup.However, Belgium failed to turn first-half dominance into clear-cut chances and were pegged back when Ogbene levelled in spectacular fashion after 35 minutes.Ogbene scored the Republic's first equaliser before teeing up Browne late onCallum Robinson's left-wing cross fell to the Rotherham United winger, whose bicycle kick deflected off Jason Denayer and past Mignolet.It was Ogbene's third goal in six Republic caps, and his first at home having netted the others in World Cup qualifiers away at Azerbaijan and Luxembourg, impressing once again with his energy and direct running. Having finished the first half on top, the Republic continued to trouble the Belgium defence and should have taken the lead within three minutes of the restart, only for Denayer to clear James McClean's effort off the line after Jason Knight failed to find Robinson. But the Irish found themselves behind once more when Vanaken rose highest to meet a corner, his header taking a decisive touch off Republic captain Coleman to wrong-foot Kelleher. After Robinson was denied by Mignolet, it looked as though Belgium would leave Dublin with a narrow victory - only for Browne to intervene. Having replaced Jeff Hendrick, the Preston midfielder headed Ogbene's cross home to spark joyous scenes as Stephen Kenny's side delivered a deserved draw for the Football Association of Ireland in a game marking the governing body's centenary. What's next? The Republic host Lithuania in another friendly on Tuesday (19:45 BST) while Belgium face Burkina Faso at the same time, before attentions turn to the Nations League in June.

493,England 2-1 Switzerland: Luke Shaw & Harry Kane goals help Three Lions earn Wembley win,SAT 26 Mar 2022,international-friendlies,"Luke Shaw's only previous goal for England was the opener against Italy in the Euro 2020 final at WembleyHarry Kane moved level with Sir Bobby Charlton on 49 England goals as they came from behind to beat Switzerland in a friendly at Wembley. England were grateful to the excellence of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in the first half but they still fell behind when Breel Embolo's header put Switzerland in front after 22 minutes. Gareth Southgate's side were second best to the confident Swiss but were handed a route back into the game when Fabian Frei's error ended with Luke Shaw providing an emphatic finish for England's equaliser in first-half stoppage time. England, who gave debuts to Marc Guehi, Kyle Walker-Peters and Tyrick Mitchell, completed the turnaround with 12 minutes left when Kane scored from the spot after VAR adjudged that Steven Zuber had handled from a corner. Kane scored with his usual expertise and now stands just four goals behind England's record marksman Wayne Rooney. Football Daily podcast: Harry moves above Gary as England beat SwitzerlandGuehi reveals 'nervous' family were not at WembleyRecap England's victory over SwitzerlandPlayer Rater: Rate the players out of 10England unconvincing but get over the lineEngland, perhaps understandably, struggled for any rhythm over long periods as manager Southgate gave his line-up an experimental appearance for the first of two Wembley friendlies in this international break. It was only the fine work of Pickford that prevented Switzerland establishing a more decisive advantage before Frei's error gave England an equaliser they barely deserved in the closing moments of the first half. Walker-Peters did well to stretch and intercept Frei's risky clearance, allowing the excellent Conor Gallagher to provide a pass that rolled into the path of Shaw, who made no mistake at the same end where he scored for England in the Euro 2020 Final against Italy at Wembley in the summer. Under Southgate, England have developed a habit of getting the job done on many occasions when they have not been at their best and so it proved again as an improved second-half display ended with Kane's winner. Kane has been approaching his best for Tottenham in recent weeks and he scored from the spot with power and precision as he took a step closer to the England record books. Kane’s strike was the 100th penalty England have scored in all competitions (excluding shootoutsHe now stands just those four goals behind Rooney's record of 53 and it is only a matter of time before he takes top spot, currently standing on a highly impressive tally of 49 goals from 68 appearances. England struggled in the opening 45 minutes, Southgate's plans disrupted in the moments before kick-off when John Stones was injured in the warm-up. He was replaced by Ben White, who saw Xherdan Shaqiri's cross float over his head for Embolo to score. Gallagher pressed his claims with a fine performance, although Declan Rice's absence from the starting line-up, then his appearance as a substitute, only emphasised his crucial importance to every element of Southgate's plans in this World Cup year. Southgate will enjoy another morale-boosting victory and he can experiment further when England meet Ivory Coast here at Wembley on Tuesday. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60803641

497,International friendly: Northern Ireland hit late double to grab away win over Luxembourg,FRI 25 Mar 2022,international-friendlies,"Northern Ireland manager Ian BaracloughCaptain Steven Davis and striker Gavin Whyte came off the bench to score two late quickfire goals that gave Northern Ireland a satisfying 3-1 friendly win in Luxembourg.The pair found the target in the final seven minutes as manager Ian Baraclough's experienced side made it three games unbeaten.Josh Magennis had given NI an early lead with an excellent finish that was equalised after the break by Marvin Martins' header from a corner.Northern Ireland are back in action in Belfast on Tuesday night when they continue their Nations League preparations by hosting Hungary in a friendly.Friday night's friendly was a first outing for Northern Ireland since they ended their World Cup 2022 qualifying campaign with an impressive 0-0 draw with Italy at Windsor Park in November - a result that sent the European champions into the play-off that they lost against North Macedonia on Thursday.Late surge adds gloss after second half became scrappyWhyte grabbed his fourth Northern Ireland goal on his 22nd appearanceIt was a satisfying victory in the end for Baraclough's men, who started the match strongly with Magennis and Shayne Lavery very lively up front. The hosts came back into the game well, however, and the match had become scrappy by the time Martins levelled on 58 minutes with a backpost header from a corner that Craig Cathcart failed to head clear.Whyte and Davis were two of four subs made on the hour-mark by Baraclough and both were involved in the 83rd-minute goal that restored the visitors' lead and moved him to joint third on the all-time Northern Ireland goalscorers' list with 13.In-form Oxford United forward Whyte showed invention in the box to turn and lay the ball off to fellow sub Niall McGinn, whose low cross broke to Davis and he prodded home from close range with the sole of his foot.Whyte, traditionally a wide man who has played through the middle more and more for NI, found himself through on goal two minutes later and composed himself well to slide a clever low finish into the bottom corner. Classy Magennis finish follows strong NI startNorthern Ireland striker Josh Magennis opened the scoring with a stylish finishWith a lot of the narrative in the build-up to the game surrounding a number of young new call-ups to the squad, Northern Ireland boss Baraclough went with a very experienced line-up skippered by Jonny Evans, who was a late addition to the squad this week.It meant the likes of Trai Hume, Paddy Lane and Caolan Boyd-Munce will have to bide their time before making their senior international debuts, though Reading goalkeeper Luke Southwood did make his first appearance when he came on at half-time for Conor Hazard.Northern Ireland signalled their intent as early as the second minute when the ever-willing Shayne Lavery wasted little time in making an impact on his return to the fold by closing the ball down and winning possession.The Blackpool striker got in behind  the home defence and delivered a dangerous low cross that flashed across goal but was just too far ahead of his strike partner Magennis.Lavery was again to the fore six minutes later when Joran Thompson found space in midfield superbly and fed the livewire forward with a fine pass that he took in his strike before delivering a low shot that went just wide of the post.Once again set up in the 3-5-2 formation that has become manager Ian Baraclough's blueprint, Northern Ireland remained on the front foot and went close again through a Corry Evans curler that was well saved by home goalkeeper Anthony Moris, who then reacted well to thwart Thompson on the follow-up.Daniel Sinani made sure Northern Ireland stand-in goalkeeper Conor Hazard stayed alive when he curled wide a few minutes before Magennis got that opening goal in the 16th minute, latching onto a long ball and shrugging Maxime Chanot with great strength before finding the far bottom corner of the net with a delicious low left-foot curler.The hosts responded well and played their way into the match, looking threatening a few times on the attack, though it was Lavery again who had the final say of the first half when he fired over the crossbar just before the break.

It is a penalty decision for a friendly game. It was soft. ""There's a lot to be pleased about. We'd have loved to have gone seven wins in a row, but it keeps the unbeaten run going.""Scotland will attempt to stretch that run to eight matches when they play a friendly in Austria on Tuesday. And if they can beat Ukraine when their delayed semi-final is played, they will face Wales in Cardiff with a place at the 2022 World Cup at stake after they beat the Austrians 2-1.Wales await in play-off finalPodcast: 'Clarke is a big, comfy armchair'Reaction & as it happenedOn a night of consequence across Europe, it would have been easy to lose Scotland amid the gravity of it all. When this date was first marked on calendars months ago, the heart of every Scotland fan would have fluttered with the excitement of a kid on Christmas Eve. Ukraine were the opposition, a shot at a World Cup play-off final the prize for both.Since, the world has changed due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with that semi-final postponed and a friendly with Poland shuffled in instead, leaving eight other countries left to it for now. Pre-match, the Hampden lights were dimmed and 15 beams in the centre of the pitch pulsed blue and yellow, with £10 from each ticket sold going to Unicef's appeal in Ukraine. But when the action started, it was the Scots who illuminated Hampden.This is a team who under Clarke are coming of age, and it was the imperious showing of two young men at the heart of it. Patterson has played 45 minutes of football at Everton this year, but he was inspired in the darker blue of his country. A threatening burst 10 minutes in unlocked the Polish defence and the crowd's excitement only for a tame shot to follow. Later in the half he would have a shot thwarted which would then trigger a scramble in the box, with the defender going close again amid a ruck of bodies and shots flying.In the middle of the park, Billy Gilmour pulled the strings and showed his class, so much so his recent lack of game time at Norwich City seems a mystery. Against a robust and experience Polish side, the Chelsea loanee was composed in possession and clinical with his passing. He, too, had a shot in that earlier melee, while a quite remarkable acrobatic goal-line clearance after the break brought Hampden to its feet.£10 from every ticket sold at Hampden was donated to Unicef's response to the invasion of Ukraine by RussiaDespite talisman Robert Lewandowski starting on the bench, Poland started brightly. Bartosz Salamon ballooned a header over from six yards. At the other end, Scotland's energy was palpable. Che Adams drove a low shot at Lukasz Skorupski, who gathered at the second attempt, while Ryan Christie headed over just before the break from a great Patterson cross.Piatek dragged a shot wide early in the second half, but it was Scotland who would kick on.John McGinn, who was captain for the night, darted through on goal after a perfect Gilmour pass. His heavy touch took him past the goalkeeper, who looked to catch the Aston Villa man, but he opted to stay on his feet with the ball running out.The game continued to rage in both directions with Gilmour's block cancelling out a rare mistake from Scott McTominay in the middle of the park. But within four minutes, the Scots thundered themselves into a deserved lead.McGinn's perfect delivery from a free-kick on the right whipped beyond a sluggish Polish back line. Arsenal's Tierney loitered and arced his body low to crash in an unstoppable header.That looked like being the winner until the dying seconds. Piatek burst past Craig Gordon in injury time and, after the faintest of touches from Grant Hanley, collapsed to the turf. Irish referee Robert Hennessy pointed to the spot, and Piatek thudded his shot straight down the middle to earn a draw.Man of the match - Nathan PattersonMinutes have been hard to come by for the Everton man, but here he was inspired. It's hard to see beyond him when that World Cup play-off arriveWhat did we learn?That none of the momentum built up by Scotland in 2021 has been lost over the last few months. Six games in a row were won coming into this one, and Clarke's team looked determined to make that seven. In the first of what may well be two dress rehearsals for a tie that nobody knows if or when it will happen, there was a tenacity about Scotland. The midfield had a bite, their press at times was intense.Most importantly, though, there was a cohesion and comfort. Against the Czech Republic and Croatia at Euro 2020, the Scots appeared overwhelmed at times. But here, against a team 12 places better off in the Fifa rankings, there was no panic in defence, not a hint of hesitation or lack of thought on the front foot.Clarke will hope the trip to Austria on Tuesday will see that continuity continue.Match statsPiatek's penalty halted Scotland's six-game winning run, which was their longest since 2007.Poland remain unbeaten in Scotland, earning two wins and three draws in five visits. It's the most Scotland have hosted any one nation without ever winning.Scotland are winless in six friendly matches at home (D2 L4) since beating Denmark at Hampden in March 2016. It's their longest winless run in home friendlies since 1997-2002 (7 games).Tierney scored his first Scotland goal in what was his 31st appearance. The goal was assisted by McGinn, who has now registered as many assists in his last three Scotland games as he had in his previous 40 (2).Gilmour earned his 11th Scotland cap - only Darren Fletcher (13), Willie Henderson (12) and Paul McStay (12) have made more appearances before their 21st birthday.What next?Scotland will now go to Vienna on Tuesday (19:45 BST) to face Austria in a friendly following the latter's World Cup play-off semi-final defeat by Wales. Poland, meanwhile, will host Sweden at the same time, with a place in Qatar the prize.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60775104
500,Tottenham 0-3 Everton: Toffees end losing run with comfortable Women's Super League win,WED 14 Dec 2022,womens-super-league,"WSL 2022: Everton stroll to 3-0 win over Tottenham HotspurEverton ended a three-game losing streak with a comfortable win over Tottenham in the final Women's Super League game of the calendar year.Katja Snoeijs opened the scoring before Jess Park capitalised on an awful error by home keeper Becky Spencer to double the lead.Ashleigh Neville was sent off in injury time for a high challenge on Everton sub Giovana, who added a fine third.This result meant Spurs closed out 2022 with four straight defeats.The form table suggested these sides were in freefall with three consecutive losses apiece, but Everton's came against title hopefuls Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United.They had intensity from the first whistle and it took just seven minutes to carve Spurs open. Sorensen found space down the right and her low cross was turned in first time by Dutch forward Snoeijs.Spurs struggled to respond and looked leggy on a frozen pitch, while Everton were comfortable and perhaps strengthened by a weekend off after their game at Brighton was postponed.They might have extended their lead before a horrible mistake gifted them a second in the 36th minute. There was little danger when Spencer received a backpass but, under pressure from Park, she hesitated, gave up possession and was helpless as the 21-year-old England forward tapped in. It has not been the start to the season Spurs had anticipated after finishing fifth last year and having made a raft of summer signings.Head coach Rehanne Skinner made three changes to the team that lost at home to West Ham on Sunday, but Everton had complete control from the start.The Toffees are the league's second-lowest scorers but did not have to work hard for their goals and were rugged at the back. They would have had another, only for sub Aggie Beever-Jones to be flagged offside after finishing neatly.Despite having more possession than their visitors, Spurs barely threatened in a pedestrian display and their misery was compounded when Neville saw red for a late lunge on substitute Giovana.The Brazil forward then took advantage of the hosts being a player down in added time as she fired a powerful shot into the top corner and sealed Everton's rise to sixth place.With their next WSL fixture not until Saturday, 14 January, Skinner's side are eighth and she has much to ponder.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443687
501,Manchester City 1-1 Manchester United: Entertaining WSL derby ends in draw,SUN 11 Dec 2022,womens-super-league,"Man City held by Man Utd in thrilling derbyManchester City played out a thrilling draw against neighbours and top-three rivals Manchester United at Etihad Stadium in front of the second-largest crowd in Women's Super League history.After a positive start from the hosts, their momentum took a knock when Leah Galton skipped past City defender Laia Aleixandri and played a one-two with Ella Toone before driving through the legs of Alex Greenwood in the 27th minute.City's first-half response was not encouraging for the subdued crowd of 44,259 - a record attendance for the hosts - and the opening exchanges of the second period did not make for better viewing.But Laura Coombs' header from Chloe Kelly's cross - which had evaded United defender Millie Turner, who was distracted by the presence of the WSL's top goal scorer Khadija Shaw - drew City level and sparked them and the home crowd into life.What ensued was an entertaining, end-to-end encounter, with both sides knowing a point - even though it was probably a fair result - would be no good to them if the title race and push for third-place goes down to the wire.City are fourth in the table, three points behind third-placed United after nine games. They trail leaders Chelsea by five points following the Blues' win over Reading on Sunday evening, but United have played one game fewer.The result means United have still never beaten their city rivals in the WSL. Four-way title race as Manchester United show no sign of fadingFollow live coverage of the Women's Super LeagueCity's game of two halvesThe hosts started the game well and for 20 minutes United struggled to deal with City's high press as the Blues limited their only chance to a Katie Zelem set-piece, smothered by goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck.But as the first half went on and the visitors managed to break through that press, City struggled to create any meaningful chances and momentary flashes of brilliance from Lauren Hemp, who did not see enough of the ball, were the only thing a subdued crowd could find to cheer about.City's frustrations came to a head when Leila Ouahabi's diving tackle cut out a superb driving run from Hannah Blundell and the former Barcelona defender screamed at her City team-mates, furious that Blundell had been able to make the run.The home side started the second half much the same and Coombs' headed goal came out of nowhere but it was the catalyst City needed to raise their game.Kelly sent in a dangerous ball that looked set for the back of the net before firing over the bar on the volley, while Hemp's low cross was skewed over the bar before it could reach the arriving Shaw.Earps twice denied the head of Shaw and the Jamaican striker almost had the chance to volley home after a scramble in the box as the crowd sensed something could be brewing.City manager Gareth Taylor paced his technical area, while United counterpart Marc Skinner opted for a more controlled position on the bench, as the crowd inside the Etihad willed the home side to find an elusive winner.After what started as a dispiriting City performance, Taylor will probably be disappointed his side could not wrap up the victory and firmly put his side among the title contenders.United's cohesion dangerous throughoutThis is the third WSL match in a row that United have played inside the bigger men's stadium and the players seem to be thriving on the big occasion.After a tricky start, where United goalkeeper Earps brilliantly punched Greenwood's deep corner away from the mouth of the goal, Galton and Blundell's link-up play down the left flank paid off.Galton's smash was the first goal United have scored in a Manchester derby at City's ground in the WSL.After the equaliser, United looked fired up and Ella Toone fired over the bar before the game settled but into something more intense than the first half, with Russo going close with her head before Roebuck produced a sensational save from a Martha Thomas header.United had chances to steal the points in the dying seconds as Toone shot over the bar before a mistake from Roebuck afforded Lucia Garcia an opportunity which was superbly blocked by Greenwood.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849445

""It's about having belief in our gameplan and not changing or letting the emotions take over at that point. It was good to see we continued to create a lot of scoring opportunities. ""We have had three games in a row where we have only, by our high standards, scored one goal in each game. That's why I think it was important from a self-confidence perspective to put a few more of the opportunities away today.""Victory briefly took Arsenal level on points with leaders Chelsea but the Blues re-established a three-point cushion by beating Reading 3-2 later on Sunday.Eidevall's side still hold a game in hand over their London rivals - and the two sides meet in their first game of 2023 when Arsenal host Chelsea on 15 January.This win was an eighth successive away triumph in the WSL for Arsenal, who always looked in control after cancelling out the early deficit, even if sixth-placed Villa did provide spirited opposition throughout.""All in all, I think we're in a great position in the league and now we need to focus on the Champions League,"" added Eidevall, whose side face Lyon and Zurich in their final two group games before Christmas.Away-day aces Arsenal avoid another 'second city' setbackAt the final whistle at Villa Park, both Arsenal and Chelsea had identical records of eight wins and just one defeat from nine WSL matches this term.That suggests this season's title race will be just as tight as last year when Chelsea pipped the Gunners by just a point. Perhaps it will be even tighter this time, with the two Manchester clubs not far behind.Last season, Arsenal were left to rue a surprise defeat at relegated Birmingham City that was construed by many to have cost them the title - and they looked in danger of suffering more 'second city' misery after Hanson's sixth-minute opener.The on-loan Manchester United forward took Kenza Dali's pass in her stride before firing a fine finish across Manuela Zinsberger into the far corner from the left-hand edge of the penalty area.Arsenal continued to look nervy at the back as Laura Blindkilde Brown's mis-hit cross struck Zinsberger's crossbar, but the Gunners retained their own threat going forward.Hannah Hampton saved well from Miedema before Hanson's opener, while Caitlin Foord blazed off target when well placed and McCabe's 25-yard free-kick whistled inches over.There was a slice of fortune about Arsenal's 26th-minute equaliser as Hampton's attempt to palm out McCabe's cross struck Corsie and ricocheted in, despite Danielle Turner's effort to clear it off the line.Arsenal led four minutes later as the luckless Hampton punched a corner straight to Miedema, who volleyed home through a crowd of bodies.After finishes of ninth and 10th in their first two WSL seasons, Carla Ward's Villa are progressing despite a raft of injuries and had won four of their past five games in league and cup.After the break, Alisha Lehmann and Dali both tested Zinsberger, but Arsenal possessed the greater quality in the attacking third, evidenced by incisive moves for their third and fourth goals.Lia Walti sent Steph Catley away and her cross was parried for Hampton for McCabe to slot home before Foord's low ball was expertly swept home by substitute Nobbs with six minutes left.Both teams now have more than a month off before their next game and Villa boss Ward is grateful for the break.""Now is the right time - I think everybody needs it mentally and physically,"" she said.""I think this next three or four weeks is a chance to not only get players back but also to bring three or four more faces into the building.

""People didn't even expect us to come here and contend with the likes of Chelsea but it shows that we can compete with the best teams,"" she added.On this form, though, Reading can look forward to their return to WSL action in January - and Chelsea's challengers for the title will have watched on encouraged as the leaders laboured to victory.Kirby haunts Royals againChelsea goalscorer Kirby - born in Reading, and a graduate of their youth system - has rarely shown mercy to her hometown club, playing a direct role in 11 goals in eight appearances against them.The England livewire averaged comfortably more than a goal a game during her three years as a first-teamer with the Royals, and her eighth against them relied on a piece of quick thinking from a free-kick and a failure from the officials to spot an apparent clear offside.The early first goal was reward for a crowd of 1,184 who sang Always Look on the Bright Side of Life during the early stages as they braved freezing conditions to watch the final game of the calendar year at Kingsmeadow.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849450

Arsenal were able to welcome back England captain Leah Williamson following a two-month absence because of a foot injury, with the 25-year-old coming on as a second-half-substitute.But Everton goalkeeper Emily Ramsey, who denied Caitlin Foord late on among her 12 saves, prevented the Gunners being assured of victory up until the final whistle.A 14th successive win over Everton moved Arsenal level with Manchester United, who earlier thrashed Aston Villa 5-0, and Chelsea after eight games - before the Blues' match against Leicester City concludes.Follow live text coverage of Saturday's Women's Super League actionMiedema stars as Arsenal bounce backArsenal have not lost consecutive league games since February 2021, while they last lost back-to-back home games in the competition in September 2016. Following the excellent Miedema's classy opener midway through the first half they rarely appeared in danger of suffering such a fate - although they could not put the game completely out of reach of a determined Everton.A dramatic 3-2 loss to Manchester United in their last league outing ended an 18-game unbeaten run for the Gunners - and suggested a four-team title race is a very real possibility this season.Manager Eidevall will be satisfied with this response after Miedema delivered the moment of quality required to clinch the points in Borehamwood.Having ended a seven-game wait for a goal last week with an equaliser against Juventus that keeps Arsenal in control of their Champions League group, the 26-year-old collected Caitlin Foord's pass and wrongfooted two defenders as she cut back on to her right foot before slamming the ball into the top corner.Miedema looked full of confidence after that spectacular finish, frequently dropping back to help her team and playing a key role in her side's most threatening attacks.She attempted seven shots - a tally matched only by team-mate Frida Maanum - but was left in disbelief as she was twice prevented from stabbing in at close-range as the Everton defence put their bodies on the line.Everton, for whom Jessica Park proved an exciting influence, struggled to manoeuvre themselves into promising positions but Nicoline Sorensen and Karen Holmgaard went close to snatching a late equaliser amid a flurry of late attempts.Lotte Wubben-Moy and Foord went close as they hosts pushed to seal the points, but victory accompanied by a 200th club appearance for the returning Williamson represented a pleasing afternoon for Arsenal.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63765147
510,Leicester 0-8 Chelsea: Leaders pile misery on struggling Foxes with ruthless display,SAT 03 Dec 2022,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights: Leicester City 0-8 ChelseaChelsea made light work of bottom side Leicester to maintain their impressive Women's Super League title defence at the King Power Stadium.The Blues were five goals up at the break thanks to Guro Reiten, Fran Kirby, Jessie Fleming, Niamh Charles and Sam Kerr.Fleming then grabbed her second and substitute Beth England headed home number seven.Kirby added an eighth on a ruthless afternoon for the leaders.It took just four minutes for Chelsea to take the lead through Reiten, who slid the ball into the bottom corner after clever link-up play with Kirby.Reiten then got the first of four assists eight minutes later, slotting the ball into Fleming and leaving her with a simple finish from close range.Fully in control, Chelsea began to exert themselves further, scoring three times in the final six minutes of the opening half.Kirby got in on the act with a classy outside-of-the-boot finish, before Charles headed home from a Reiten corner.Not to be left out, Kerr added a fifth as Reiten's assist stole the show again. Her searching ball left the Australian with an easy task, but her finish was typically emphatic.Five minutes after the break, Fleming added to Leicester's misery. Jemma Purfield's weak clearance from Charles' cross fell to her, and she dispatched with confidence.Moments after their introduction, Alsu Abdullina and England linked up for the latter to head home a seventh 15 minutes from time.There was still time for Kirby to bundle home late on, with Abdullina involved again.Brilliant Blues mark Hayes landmark in styleThis result is hardly a surprise. Leicester, albeit improving in terms of performances under Willie Kirk, came into this game bottom of the table without a point from their first eight games.By contrast, the champions kicked off knowing they'd need a victory to stay there after Manchester United's thumping win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford.Although they couldn't match or surpass their numerical dominance from their last visit to the King Power back in March when they won 9-0, their dominance here was just as evident.It was the Reiten show in the first half, and her ball for Kerr was particularly eye-catching as she enjoyed a record-equalling four assists in the WSL. But the difference in quality was so great that almost everybody had their moment on the occasion of coach Emma Hayes' 300th match in charge.Leicester battled well, but will be relieved their season will not be defined by tough games like this as they remain four points adrift of 11th-placed Reading.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63765142

Liverpool, in 10th place, are now five points clear of the Foxes, while second-bottom Reading have a four-point advantage.But they will feel like they could have won this match, having each gone in front in the second half.Rhiannon Roberts looked to have given Liverpool only their second league winThe Reds dominated the opening exchanges and deservedly went ahead when Stengel headed in Melissa Lawley's cross, only for teenager Primmer to equalise with a looping shot in first-half injury-time.Reading, whose only league win this season has come against Leicester, were much improved after the break and went 2-1 up through former Liverpool forward Dowie's close-range effort.The visitors, though, bounced back in an entertaining affair, with Stengal adding her fifth of the season and Roberts putting them on course for victory with 17 minutes left.But Reading equalised a second time in the closing stages as Troelsgaard met Amalie Eikeland's cross to deny Liverpool a second league win of the season.It means Matt Beard's side have recorded back-to-back 3-3 draws after ending a six-match losing run against Brighton last weekend.Meanwhile, Reading have now won just one of their past 10 home matches in all competitions and remain a point behind Liverpool.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62784258
512,Chelsea 3-0 Tottenham: Manager Emma Hayes returns as Blues go top of WSL,SUN 20 Nov 2022,womens-super-league,"Chelsea 3-0 Tottenham highlightsEmma Hayes said it was ""like being back with family"" as she returned to the dugout for Chelsea's 3-0 Women's Super League victory over Tottenham.Hayes had been missing since early October as she recovered from surgery.She oversaw a comfortable win thanks to goals from Sam Kerr, Erin Cuthbert and Guro Reiten.Hayes said: ""My back was killing me in the second half, but I didn't feel like I'd been away. I just felt like I was going back to my family.""The match was played in front of 38,300 fans at Stamford Bridge - a record home crowd for Chelsea women.The victory puts Chelsea three points clear at the top of the WSL after they, Arsenal and Manchester United started Sunday level on 18 points from seven games following United's extraordinary 3-2 comeback win at Emirates Stadium on Saturday.Bumper weekend shows WSL must grow to keep upHayes comes homeHayes, 46, has been away for six weeks following an emergency hysterectomy as part of her ""ongoing battle with endometriosis"".In her absence assistant Denise Reddy and general manager Paul Green have guided the team to six wins out of six in all competitions - and there was little doubt about Hayes picking up where her colleagues left off.In a typically irreverent press conference afterwards - in which she answered the phone to Kerr halfway through, before saying she had baked cookies and banana bread rather than watch Chelsea from home given her confidence in her staff - Hayes said: ""Pitch-side, when you're without the ball, you can get more stressed about something.""At home, against Man Utd, I felt comfortable first half, and I'm not sure everyone felt comfortable pitch-side - you can't be calm about it. ""Today, even when the game started slowing, I used my experience from home, and I chilled out - at least for the portions of the game which might stress the team out.""I don't want to be home on the sofa any more - Harry [her son] wants me there but I don't.""For the most part I was left alone  - I needed to recover, I was poorly. I don't think I spoke to Millie [Bright] and Magda [Eriksson] for two weeks, which I really needed.""I feel like a mother hen, coming back.""Kerr scored after 12 minutes through the first decent chance Chelsea had. A Bright ball from the back opened Spurs like a tin of beans, the Australian shrugged off her defender, had the freedom of Stamford Bridge to set herself and place the ball into the far corner past the goalkeeper and three covering defenders.Having quietened the crowd in the opening 10 minutes, it was a poor goal for Spurs to concede and they never fully recovered.Rehanne Skinner's side won 8-0 against Brighton in their previous WSL game on October 30 - a waterlogged pitch cancelled their game against Everton before the international break - but they looked a shadow of that side.Skinner said afterwards: ""There were some positives to take out of the game in terms of how we played in possession at times, I thought we moved the ball really well, created some opportunities to get into the final third but I don't think we were convincing in our shooting opportunities as much as we probably should have been.""We made a few mistakes and they capitalised on them and ultimately that cost us today.""The comfortable win for Chelsea will also reassure Hayes that they can deal with the absence of Pernille Harder, who suffered a hamstring injury while on international duty with Denmark.Cuthbert celebrates contract with wonder goalCuthbert this week signed a new deal that will keep her at Chelsea until 2025 - nine years after she joined as a teenager.She celebrated by scoring a stunning goal after 26 minutes, chesting down a half-cleared corner and volleying into the top corner from 20 yards. Spurs keeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela got a hand to it but could not stop it.Hayes said of Cuthbert: ""I'm sure I won't stop hearing from her. It was an outstanding goal from an outstanding player.""Soon after it was 3-0 as Ashleigh Neville clipped the heels of Lauren James in the area. Reiten was an unexpected choice to step up, but she confidently sent Korpela the wrong way.From then on it was a straightforward afternoon out for the hosts in a game which marked the 30th anniversary since the official founding of the women's team.They could have had more - Bright clattered the crossbar and Beth England flicked over the bar with her heel - but a Mexican wave midway through the second half showed just how comfortable the game became.The attendance eclipsed the 24,564 that saw Chelsea take on Spurs at Stamford Bridge in 2019, making it a successful afternoon all round for Chelsea and Hayes.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63612798

Reading are second-bottom with three.Daly firing on all cylinders for VillaEngland international Daly, who joined Aston Villa in the summer from the Houston Dash, has already scored eight for a club who only managed 13 in total last season.The versatile player, who has been used as a full-back by Sarina Wiegman for England, now leads the WSL's goalscoring charts alongside Manchester City's Khadija Shaw.Villa boss Carla Ward claimed earlier in the season that ""she's not a defender, she's a centre forward,"" and Daly's latest goals continue to add to her case.Wade's opener gave hope to the visitors yet their aspirations for a second win of the season were crushed by Daly by half-time.She met a well-guided cross from Rachel Corsie to net her first goal of the game, before converting Kenza Dali's corner, though the ball deflected off Royals defender Natasha Dowie on the way in.Burns' dismissal saw Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Moloney appear in a Royals shirt for the first time since September.She was beaten from the spot by Daly only minutes after coming on after Gemma Evans fouled the Villa striker inside the box.And the Villa striker came close to netting another minutes later as she had the ball in the back of the net once again but she was adjudged to have been offside.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63612800

But the entrance of substitute Van de Sanden proved pivotal on the Netherlands legend's return from an achilles problem.Former Brighton regular Emma Koivisto also went close for the Reds, who were denied by the crossbar as they avoided a third consecutive defeat in this fixture in dramatic fashion.Matt Beard's side now have the chance to move away from trouble when they visit Reading, who are level on points with them, on Thursday.Robinson strike marks memorable weekRobinson, 20, will not forget the most memorable week of her career so far, playing a starring role as the Seagulls made it eight goals in two games since the 8-0 defeat to Tottenham that signalled the end of former manager Hope Powell's reign in their previous home match.Robinson's impressive performances were rewarded by an England debut against Norway on Tuesday.Merricks said in the build-up to this game that Robinson would be buoyed rather than distracted by her Lionesses bow, and the youngster's challenging start to her senior career will surely enhance her mood.After an ACL injury kept her out of the 2020-21 season, the former England youth international signed a new contract at Brighton, made her WSL debut and also had a loan spell at Charlton earlier this year.The patience Robinson and her club showed has paid off, and her shot that looped over Eartha Cumings' outstretched arm was as destined for the highlights reels as it was for the roof of the net.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63612799

She's found a rhythm now in knowing she's the focal point of the team.""Everton equalised from a corner when a scramble in the box saw former Toffees keeper Sandy MacIver try to punch the ball away, but it fell straight to Rikke Sevecke who powered a header into the back of the net.But Shaw was there again to tap in the rebound and restore City's lead just after half-time when Laura Coombs fired an ambitious shot which smacked off the post.This is City's fifth consecutive victory in the Women's Super League and moves them fourth, level on points with Manchester United in third.Meanwhile, the loss was Everton's third consecutive home defeat of the season and leaves them seventh in the WSL.Arsenal host Manchester United at Emirates Stadium in Saturday's late kick-off.City 'still believe' they can win leagueReplacing England's top goalscorer Ellen White, who retired after the summer Euros, as the starting number nine at City is no mean feat but it is a mantle Shaw has taken on with ease.The 25-year-old's goalscoring form continues to devastate WSL teams as she notched her eighth goal in seven games, the most in the WSL, and caused Everton trouble throughout.She sent in a cross for Blakstad whose header went over the bar but, with four of Shaw's goals this season coming from headers, City would have preferred a role reversal.Shaw also had a goal ruled out for offside when she made a run deep into the Everton half and her shot from near the byeline found the back of the net.""A lot of her play was very high standard today,"" said boss Taylor. ""She was always there, she probably could've had a hat-trick today. It's great she scored but we're always thinking about how do we support and help her to play more consistently.""City, whose brilliance has gone somewhat under the radar this season with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United dominating the headlines, have won their past five consecutive league games after back-to-back losses at the start of the campaign.""We believe we can win the league still. We want to pick off the games one by one,"" said Taylor.""Having spent more time with players you can see the rhythm we're gaining, the communication is improving, the players are understanding the style more and more.""They had the chance to extend their lead when a cross ricocheted off the post to Kelly, who attempted an overhead kick which was helped along by Blakstad but her header hit the post.Unlike last season when City struggled for depth because of injuries, they seem to be clicking with a strong starting line-up and options on the bench.City will however be without winger Lauren Hemp until at least the derby, Taylor confirmed, after she picked up a knock in the 3-0 win over Reading last time out and was left out of the England squad for the Lionesses' recent international friendlies.Toffees still winless against CityEverton have now lost all 13 WSL matches against City - the worst record one team has against another in the competition.The Toffees have also not managed to win a game this season when conceding the first goal.They did have chances to get something from the match and the additions of Aggie Beever-Jones and Gio made an impact late on while the Toffees were fairly solid defensively.With just one goal separating the two sides Everton had chances to level proceedings when Gio was through on goal but opted to square instead where Ouahabi blocked, before Beever-Jones smashed a shot into the side-netting.A frantic final 10 minutes saw both sides go close as Ramsey was called upon to save a Kelly shot heading for the top corner, after Beever-Jones had another chance to level but her shot was weak.They were missing perhaps a moment of brilliance from someone like Jess Park, who, after scoring on her England debut last week, was unable to play against her parent club.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63606404

Skinner had called for ""brains on seats"" before the game, meaning that women's football has to attract dedicated fans rather than day trippers.If the 40,064 spectators at this game have some sense, they will surely think to come back for more after that spectacular conclusion.Relive Saturday's WSL action live here.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63606405

""That's good for the team and it's very good for her.""From a coach perspective, I like to see a lot of the goals we are scoring now and you can see a pattern in the goals.""The strikes from Foord and Catley mean 10 different Arsenal players have scored in their opening six games, and Leicester simply had no answer to the Gunners' dual threat from open play and set-pieces.Arsenal set the tone inside 30 seconds as Maanum's 20-yarder forced a smart save from Kirstie Levell and, a minute later, Blackstenius' shot was deflected onto the bar by a Foxes defender.Maanum broke the deadlock with a tidy finish with the outside of her right boot after Levell palmed out a Blackstenius cross, and Foord quickly doubled the lead from close range after Mead's fine run.In driving rain, Catley's corner evaded everyone in the six-yard box to creep in before Blackstenius rounded Levell from Lotte Wubben-Moy's ball over the top to add Arsenal's fourth.Arsenal could even afford the luxury of a rare Mead miss late on as they eased off for much of the second period with the game already won.Blackstenius 'wonderful' goal puts Arsenal 4-0 upDifficult enterprise awaits KirkFirst games in the dugout do not come much more daunting although Kirk, who took over from Lydia Bedford in midweek, will have drawn some positives from the way Leicester competed against their high-flying visitors.""It's not a game you choose for your first match,"" Kirk told BBC Sport. ""That's the best team in Europe so far this season and as far as I am concerned, I don't think they had to work too hard for their goals which is probably the most disappointing thing.""We worked hard for over 90 minutes. I thought that was very evident to see. I think we do have a bit to go in terms of fitness so that will only improve going forward.""Leicester had a great chance to halve the deficit at 2-0 when CJ Bott surged into the Arsenal area but was denied by a superb sprawling save from Manuela Zinsberger.Missy Goodwin's late 20-yarder also forced a smart fingertip from Zinsberger but while Leicester again failed to trouble the scorers, they did defend gallantly to keep the margin of defeat down and remain only three points adrift of Reading and Liverpool in the battle to stay up.Leicester survived last season despite losing each of their opening nine matches in their debut WSL season, but have now picked up only one point from the past 42 available across this campaign and the end of last term.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443693

There's been no talk in the dressing room or around the club,"" Ward told BBC Sport. ""They are professional, turn up and get the job done. We said all week it might be an ugly game and we needed to make sure we came away with the points.""Penalty decides close encounterIt was a wet afternoon at Prenton Park and both teams cancelled each other out for the first half an hour.Liverpool wing-back Emma Koivisto and Villa's Lehmann were often able to get in behind down the right-hand side for their teams as both sides were sloppy in possession.Reds defender Gilly Flaherty was particularly strong in the first half, while striker Katie Stengel did well to hold the ball up as Liverpool counter-attacked. Stengel teed up Koivisto when she almost curled it inside the right post, while Megan Campbell's long throws caused problems for Villa - Stengel nodding one into the side-netting from a tight angle.Liverpool were ending the first half strongly as Jasmine Matthews' header was cleared off the line but as it came back to Koivisto on the edge of the box, she slipped, allowing Lehmann to run clean through.She had to carry the ball almost the length of the pitch and as she approached goal, goalkeeper Laws steadied herself before tipping the shot brilliantly onto the post.That signed off a first half in which Villa's front three had posed a threat and were able to get in behind, but Liverpool had looked the more likely to score.""I think the best team won on the day. We dominated the ball. They had a foothold on things for about 10-15 minutes at the end of the first half and we had to ride the storm,"" added Ward. ""We were in second gear in the first half and needed to up the tempo and look after the ball better. In the second half we were a lot better. The goal changed the game obviously.""Villa's quality began to show more after the break as Hanson and Kenza Dali began to link up more effectively and Liverpool's midfield started to tire.Hanson was played in behind and she got to the ball quicker than Laws to win Villa's penalty, which Daly coolly thumped straight down the middle. That goal meant Liverpool became more open as they pushed for an equaliser - manager Matt Beard bringing on substitutes Shanice van de Sanden and Missy Bo Kearns to try to find a way back into the game.""It's an official's decision that's changed the game,"" Liverpool boss Beard told BBC Sport. ""I've watched it back. I have respect for the referee but it's not a penalty. It's frustrating because I don't know what a penalty is anymore. ""Moments like that shouldn't define games. But we can't lose our discipline like we did after it.""Ward added: ""I need to see it again but they feel fairly strongly, maybe they have a case. I don't know. From where I was stood I would have been astounded had it not been given.""However Villa, who now have three wins from their opening six matches, looked comfortable at the back and did not look like conceding in the second half.They host Reading in their next match after the international break in a strong position in the league.""I thought [the back four] were excellent. Dan Turner… find me a more in-form centre-half in the league. There's not. She's got to be knocking on the door [for an England call-up]."" said Ward.Meanwhile, Liverpool go into a period manager Beard has previously described as ""season defining"", searching for their first win since the WSL's opening weekend.""Ultimately if you want to win football matches you need to take your chances. If we had taken one or two of them today it could have been a completely different result,"" said Beard.""We have to change it and we need to do it quickly. We have an international break now so pray everyone comes back fit. It's a big four games now.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443690
520,Reading 0-3 Manchester City: Two own goals and a Bunny Shaw header earn visitors win,SUN 06 Nov 2022,womens-super-league,"Hemp has been involved in 13 goals in her last 13 WSL games for City, scoring seven goals and assisting six timesTwo own goals from Reading captain Emma Mukandi handed Manchester City victory in the Women's Super League at the Select Car Leasing Stadium.City lacked cutting edge in places but it was consistent pressure from Lauren Hemp that resulted in Mukandi's two second-half mistakes.Bunny Shaw's header from Mary Fowler's cross - her seventh goal in six league games - wrapped up the points.It is City's fourth consecutive league victory.Gareth Taylor's side are fourth in the table with 12 points, heading into the international break.Reading, meanwhile, are second from bottom with three points, having earned their first points of the season last weekend with victory over Leicester, which ended a run of 14 consecutive WSL matches without a win.Man City get the job doneCity were dominant in possession and had chances to see the game off in the first half as Hemp looked lively on the left-hand side and Deyna Castellanos led the attack from midfield.Their build-up play was clean and concise but Shaw struggled in the first half to find the clinical form that she has demonstrated in recent weeks.The Jamaica forward had chances to open the scoring when she took a heavy touch from a pinpoint Hemp cross before heading miles over the bar on the stroke of half time.Hayley Raso, who scored the winner against Liverpool last week, had a chance of her own when she nipped round Royals goalkeeper Jackie Burns and fired a shot hard and low into the corner but Burns dived down to her left and managed to punch the ball away.Although the two opening goals were poor mistakes by Reading captain Mukandi, it was undeniably as a result of Hemp's consistent and extensive pressure around the penalty area.The 22-year-old played a one-two with Shaw on the edge of the area and fired a square ball across the box where Mukandi completely mistimed her attempt to clear for the first goal.Hemp sent in another dangerous ball which was pushed away by goalkeeper Burns but ricocheted off defender Mukandi's thigh into the net for the second.City were more alert in the final 15 minutes after the arrival of Chloe Kelly and Shaw finally got her goal when Mary Fowler swung in a lofty ball and her team-mate buried her header.City have won 12 of their last 14 WSL matches.Follow live WSL action and reaction",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443688
521,West Ham United 4-5 Brighton & Hove Albion: Danielle Carter scores two as Seagulls win thriller,SUN 06 Nov 2022,womens-super-league,"WSL Highlights: Brighton edge West Ham in nine-goal thrillerDanielle Carter scored twice and set up another as Brighton began life without Hope Powell by winning a nine-goal Women's Super League thriller at West Ham. Brighton led 3-1 and 5-2 but were forced to hold on by a late Hammers rally as they climbed two places to ninth courtesy of only a second win of the season.Powell left Brighton this week, after five years in charge, following their dismal 8-0 home defeat by Tottenham and they again fell behind to Lisa Evans' early cross-shot.However, Carter pounced on Hammers goalkeeper Sophie Hillyerd's poor touch to equalise and then turned provider to cross for Veatriki Sarri to slide Brighton in front.Former Arsenal and England forward Carter made it 3-1 from the penalty spot after Grace Fisk tripped Julia Zigiotti Olme, only for Victoria Williams' own goal to hand the Hammers a lifeline.Cool finishes from Elisabeth Terland and Jorja Fox seemed to have sewn victory up for Brighton but Viviane Asseyi's late double set up a frantic finale including almost 10 minutes of time added on.Relive West Ham v Brighton and the rest of Sunday's WSL actionThey had a number of opportunities to salvage an unlikely point but Claudia Walker spurned the clearest chance, prodding wide after an error from Seagulls stopper Megan Walsh.Walsh had been caught out by Evans' third-minute effort that looped over her head but Carter then took control as Albion completed a quickfire turnaround with three goals in 12 minutes.Hillyerd was at fault for two of them, gifting Carter the ball for the first and then spilling a cross in the lead-up to the penalty for the third, although she did make a fine save from Olme's 20-yarder.After the break, Williams diverted a deep free-kick into her own net under pressure to halve the Hammers' deficit and then collided with Hillyerd at the other end in a worrying moment for the latter.With no goalkeeper on the bench, Hillyerd was deemed fit to continue after a lengthy spell of treatment but conceded from the resulting corner as Terland was allowed time to hook home.Fox drilled Brighton's fifth into the bottom corner after Hillyerd parried a cross but Asseyi scored twice in two minutes with, first, her head and, then, her right foot from a pair of inviting Evans crosses.However, the Hammers could not find an equaliser and slip to eighth, a place above Brighton, who move six points clear of the relegation place despite conceding 23 goals in their opening six games.The result continued Brighton's hold over the Hammers, having beaten them in each of their past five meetings, as well as winning four of their past five away at the Irons.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443686
522,Manchester United 1-3 Chelsea: United suffer first defeat of season,SUN 06 Nov 2022,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights: Manchester United 1-3 ChelseaChelsea scored two goals in four minutes to end Manchester United's perfect start to the Women's Super League season at Leigh Sports Village.United had won five consecutive games without conceding a single goal.But one sloppy passage of play gave Sophie Ingle the opportunity to pick out Sam Kerr, who fired her shot into the bottom corner past goalkeeper Mary Earps.United were opened up again when a long ball got behind the defence and found Kerr in space on the edge of the area and Lauren James coolly converted her simple pass.United pulled one back through Alessia Russo's swept shot but Erin Cuthbert sealed the deal for Chelsea in injury time.Chelsea move level on points with Arsenal at the top of the WSL while United drop to third.Man Utd boss vows to 'bridge gap' after stumbleChelsea show experience and classDefending champions Chelsea, going for their fourth consecutive WSL title, came into this game with five straight wins under their belt and showed their experience against a United team searching for their first ever top-three finish.Although the first half didn't present many clear-cut opportunities, they were more comfortable on the ball and seemed happy to keep pegging United back.The Blues had an early shout for a penalty when Maya Le Tissier caught Guro Reiten just inside the area - but it did look like a slip and, perhaps coupled with Reiten's lack of appeal, the referee didn't see enough for a spot-kick.Chelsea came close when Niamh Charles looped in what at first seemed like a cross but Earps had to be alert as her fingertip save kept it out and a searching Cuthbert cross made its way to Kerr who volleyed across the box to Pernille Harder, whose header was just wide.Cuthbert, who had been fairly quiet, took her chance when it came and her deflected shot capped off a professional performance where the Blues could have probably scored more.Defending champions Chelsea remain without manager Emma Hayes as she continues to recover from a hysterectomy but showed their class to execute a professional performance.Blow to United's impressive startIt could be said that United, who have made an impressive start to the season and put themselves in the conversation as title-contenders, have not yet been asked real questions when it comes to their defence and form against the top sides.They have put in stellar performances, but this result puts a dent in not only United's unbeaten start to the season but perhaps also their confidence when faced with top sides.After a tricky first half United started the second much brighter as their attempts to unlock the Chelsea defence improved.But Chelsea's first goal was a sloppy one for United to concede and having shipped no goals in five games it clearly rocked the confidence of what had, up until then, been a solid defence.Maria Thorisdottir passed the ball straight to Ingle deep in United's half and it was all too easy for Kerr to finish the move one-on-one with Le Tissier.United showed their lack of experience in what is their first real test of the season when they conceded again less than four minutes later.But, buoyed by a record crowd of 6,186 at Leigh Sports Village, Toone released Russo after Chelsea carelessly gave the ball away to pull one back.The flurry of action gave United a boost as Hayley Ladd saw her decent effort from range sail over and Russo once again went close.But while the result showed vast improvement on last season's 6-1 thumping in the same fixture last season, Chelsea's quality and experience shone through.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63443694

Tottenham growing on and off pitch as WSL thrashing of Brighton showsBartrip's opener was a training ground move from a corner, ending with the defender lobbing Brighton goalkeeper Megan Walsh from outside the area. A Walsh error led to Spurs' second, the keeper failing to control the ball with her feet and allowing Karczewska to put the simplest of chances into an empty net.But there was nothing Walsh could do about the third goal, a brilliant volley from Neville where she had latched on to a flick-on from a corner. Neville was involved in the fourth with a superb backheel in the centre circle that enabled Spence to run in on goal before placing her shot past Walsh.There was no let-up after the break, Neville sending in a looping header for 5-0 and Spence converting a pass from Neville after spinning round to shoot low across Walsh.Naz, a second-half substitute, grabbed her first moments after Spence's second with a lob from long-range over a backpedalling Walsh, and she doubled her tally with seven minutes left when after nearly tangling with team-mate Cho So-hyun, she swept the ball past Walsh.The victory put Tottenham six points behind league leaders Manchester United with nine points from five matches, while Brighton are second from bottom with three points.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63362234

In doing so, the Wales international became United's 10th different scorer in the WSL this season.""The players were magnificent,"" Skinner told BBC Sport. ""We were ruthless when we needed to be.""Tougher challenges await Skinner's team in the next few weeks. They host Chelsea on 6 November (18:45 GMT) before facing Arsenal at Emirates Stadium on 19 November (17:30).""We want to pitch ourselves against the best,"" added Skinner. ""We know how tough it will be but that's what we're here for. ""That's where we aspire to be and we'll give everything to try and get the results from them.""If United's 100% winning record remains intact after Chelsea and Arsenal, they will have reason to aim for more than just Champions League qualification.Manchester United have won five games out of five in the Women's Super League in 2022-23Everton's home woes continueEverton have now lost eight of their past 14 home games in the WSL and have taken just 12 points from a possible 42 in front of their own fans.There is no doubt they are moving in the right direction under Brian Sorensen - but with a chance to produce a statement win under their new manager, they contributed to their own downfall with some sloppy defending.Gabby George, Aggie Beever-Jones and Karen Holmgaard tested visiting goalkeeper Mary Earps but it was far too comfortable for United in the end.Everton finished the match with 10 players on the pitch, with Katrine Veje forced off with an injury after they had made all their substitutions. ""We showed in small patches what we can do. But we need to put more than 25 minutes of good football to be a strong team like Manchester United,"" said Sorensen.""It's probably where we are right now.

Visitors Liverpool threatened and caused problems, though City had plenty of opportunity to add to their tally.Khadija Shaw opened the scoring as City won their third successive WSL match.Liverpool, who were promoted to the WSL after winning the Championship last season, stunned champions Chelsea to win on the opening weekend and threatened to take points off City at Academy Stadium.Matt Beard's side pressed and hurried City into making mistakes at the back, and it was England international Alex Greenwood who gave away possession to Stengel for their equaliser.""Before they scored we were a little naive in our play. I wouldn't say it's confusion but decision-making,"" said Manchester City manager Gareth Taylor.""I thought we started the game really well. They are difficult to play against, there's no doubt about that. We gave away far too many set-pieces and they have real weapons with that. ""We should have put the game to bed a lot quicker than we did, but it was great that Hayley [Raso] came on and made an impact within six minutes. ""She contributed again, then it was a case of seeing the game out as there were a few scary moments.""Stengel's equaliser cancelled out Shaw's opener which she coolly slotted past goalkeeper Rachael Laws after a through ball from Lauren Hemp. Jamaica international Shaw is in fine form with five goals in her past three WSL appearances and was denied on several occasions by Liverpool goalkeeper Laws. Hemp was a constant threat down the left, while Chloe Kelly almost set up Laura Coombs and Shaw with dangerous balls in from the opposite wing.Liverpool had a bright spell at the end of the first half when Missy Bo Kearns was denied from close range and Emma Koivisto was blocked at the back post by Coombs. But City responded after the break to take control and put further pressure on Laws in goal. They thought they had scored their second when defender Megan Campbell had to make a crucial goalline clearance to stop Hemp's header going in, before Raso came on to fire into the roof of the net for what proved City's winner. A stunning save from Laws late on kept out Coombs at the back post to keep it at 2-1, and Liverpool almost equalised when Rhiannon Roberts' header was scrambled clear in stoppage time.Liverpool have now suffered four successive defeats in the WSL after winning their opening game, while City are building momentum with three wins in a row despite losing their first two matches.""Matt [Beard] has a really well-organised team that work hard for him and fight to the end. They are always there. They won't give up,"" added Taylor. ""Liverpool have tenacious players and options from the bench. This was a vital three points to continue our run. It was all about the win.""Shaw continues impressive formKhadija Shaw has scored five goals in Manchester City's past three WSL gamesShaw came into this match in stunning form for Manchester City having scored a brace in each of their past two league victories over Leicester and Tottenham.Her opener at Academy Stadium was her 15th goal in her 14th league start and she is clearly a player full of confidence as she took it well.Hemp slid the ball precisely through a wall of Liverpool defenders and Shaw calmly placed it past goalkeeper Laws into the far corner.The Jamaican continued to be a nuisance but it was Raso who stole the headlines with a lovely finish after reacting quickest to the rebound from her own effort - set up by Shaw. Manchester City were made to work for their victory but have now extended their unbeaten record at home against Liverpool to seven WSL matches - they last dropped points against them at home in June 2016.There were positives for Liverpool, however, as they ended a run of three games without scoring and almost came close to nicking a point away from home for the first time this season.Defeat leaves them 10th in the table heading into a crucial run of fixtures against Aston Villa, Brighton and Reading. ""I thought we did well but probably the better team won,"" said Liverpool boss Beard.""We've had a difficult start. There's plenty of positives we can take but we need to start turning these performances into points. ""The consistency in our performance levels are getting better every week. We have shown we can compete. The next six weeks will be vitally important and they will define our season. ""Hopefully we can take confidence from how far we pushed Manchester City.""Liverpool were boosted by the return of summer signing Shanice van de Sanden from injury, who came on as a late substitute to make her debut in her second spell at the club.The Netherlands forward could be a crucial addition to the squad during Liverpool's next run of fixtures in the build-up to Christmas. ""She's an unbelievable character in the dressing room. To have her back and available is brilliant for me. You saw her pace,"" added Beard.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63362232

She has had to bide her time for minutes at Arsenal with competition for places in midfield but Nobbs now has two goals in four days after her strike against Zurich in the Champions League on Thursday.""Every one of us on the bench has been working so hard in training,"" Nobbs told Sky Sports.""It's a credit to the mentality. We've had so many games but we know those moments will come to get game time.""I've had a rough few years [with injuries]. We have such a talented squad and in the last few months I've just had to work really hard. That chance always comes and I'm glad I could take mine.""It was a deserved win in the end for Arsenal and they keep pace with leaders Manchester United, who recorded a 3-0 victory against Everton earlier on Sunday.However, West Ham put in a strong performance and should have been two goals ahead before Nobbs scored Arsenal's first shortly before half-time. Nobbs' equaliser cancelled out West Ham captain Dagny Brynjarsdottir's opener, who had earlier headed in from a corner but saw the goal wrongly ruled out after Kim Little appeared to slip.Brynjarsdottir was frustrated by the referee's decision to penalise her when Arsenal midfielder Little clearly slipped with no infringement in the box.The West Ham midfielder responded minutes later though when she pounced on a series of mistakes at the back by Arsenal - poking it over the line from close range after Steph Catley's poor back-pass bounced off the post and into Brynjarsdottir's path.That ended Arsenal's record run of 10 consecutive WSL matches without conceding but Jonas Eidevall's side showed their quality to recover and claim three points.""Happy with the three points and our performance but we were sloppy with mistakes,"" manager Eidevall told Sky Sports. ""We won because we fought our way back in and we had good substitutions. The three substitutions all added quality.""Nobbs came on in the 40th minute, replacing Little, who was helped off by the medical staff after twisting her knee and was then put on a stretcher.Blackstenius put Arsenal ahead in the second half, volleying in Catley's superb free-kick delivery, before Maanum netted her third goal in as many WSL starts when she headed in Katie McCabe's curling cross.""We're fortunate to have a player like Jordan [Nobbs] in the squad,"" added Eidevall. ""Once again we see a player that has prepared so well. She came on with quality and that's the difference.""Nobbs added: ""I know I need to play to get into the England squad. Sarina Wiegman makes that very clear. I just have to take chances when I can. I know I need to be playing football.""Arsenal's 100% record this season means they sit level on points with Manchester United and Chelsea - with the Blues having played a game extra - though they are in second place on goal difference.West Ham drop to seventh place with three wins from their opening six matches under manager Paul Konchesky, who took over this summer.Arsenal's impressive run rolls on despite West Ham's threat Dagny Brynjarsdottir has scored four goals in six WSL games for West Ham this seasonArsenal missed out on the WSL title by a point to Chelsea last season but they have shown their credentials as challengers again this year.After beating Zurich on Thursday in the Women's Champions League, Eidevall made six changes to the starting XI with Vivianne Miedema once again on the bench.He was forced into an early change with Little's concerning injury but Nobbs did not disappoint.She was also on the scoresheet on Thursday and picked up a second player-of-the-match award in a row with her performance against West Ham.Lina Hurtig also made an impression when she came on, forcing late saves from young West Ham goalkeeper Sophie Hillyerd, making her full debut. Hillyerd, meanwhile, was one of several impressive performers for West Ham as she kept out Caitlin Foord and Blackstenius, before Maanum struck the post in stoppage time.Full-back Kirsty Smith did well going forward and Brynjarsdottir caused problems all game - her late strike stopped by Manuela Zinsberger almost rebounded to Viviane Asseyi before it was punched behind by the goalkeeper in an impressive double save.Konchesky has overseen steady progress this season and West Ham's three defeats have all come against the league's top three - Arsenal, United and Chelsea.They showed plenty of threat at Meadow Park and in Brynjarsdottir, who has scored four goals in six WSL games, they have a player in terrific form.""We started very well again and for 70 minutes were great but maybe the strength in depth in the squad shows,"" said Konchesky. ""We could have had another goal but it wasn't to be. Dagny wasn't happy. Sometimes you get those decisions and sometimes you don't.

Foord hit the outside of the right post in the first half, while Stina Blackstenius was denied by Laws from close range after the break.Ballon d'Or runner-up Beth Mead had a quiet afternoon, though she was played in behind in the first half and could have had a clear sight of goal but for her poor touch. She also came close late on but was denied by Laws.'Everything Arsenal touches turns to gold'Arsenal were able to make changes in the second half too, bringing on striker Vivianne Miedema, who began on the bench for a second successive match.Japan international Mana Iwabuchi came on in stoppage time for her first minutes of the campaign but appeared upset at full-time.Eidevall, meanwhile, was seen speaking with Miedema at the end - but asked what that conversation was about, and whether she was frustrated not to start again, the manager said: ""That's internal. I can't speak about how other people would feel. You would have to ask her.""The Arsenal boss added: ""We knew this would be a test with Liverpool's set-pieces and direct style of play. ""I thought it was a real [show of] strength by the defenders who started the game, and also by Jen Beattie coming in, which shows the importance of having players ready to step in.""We could substitute some really tired legs here in the second half and I thought that added stability in our performance.""Arsenal have won all four of their matches in the WSL this seasonLiverpool, meanwhile, were frustrated again as they showed in patches their ability to compete at this standard but, without injured duo Leanne Kiernan and Shanice van de Sanden, lacked the firepower to hurt Arsenal.""Over the course of the game, we did well but everything Arsenal touch at the moment turns to gold,"" said Liverpool boss Beard.""We had a clear penalty that wasn't given. That could change the game a little bit.""Things will change up there [in the attacking areas].

Losing Leanne and Shanice is a big blow but we can take heart from today.""How Sunday's WSL games unfoldedArsenal show difference in qualityArsenal have had a strong start to the season and did not look likely to drop points at Prenton Park.They dealt with a bright start from Liverpool, held firm on set-pieces and had the quality to take their chances when they arrived.It was not the free-flowing and ruthless display they had put in against Lyon but it was more than enough to seal three points as they continue their pursuit of the WSL title they just missed out on last season.Arsenal have now kept a clean sheet in a record-extending 10 consecutive WSL matches - three games more than any side have previously achieved.In contrast, Liverpool have struggled to add to their points tally since shocking Chelsea on the opening weekend and have now lost three successive WSL matches.The Reds are yet to score a goal from open play this season, though there were positive signs for manager Beard in the second half as they looked more dangerous.A continuing concern will be Liverpool's inability to make half-time without conceding. They have conceded in the first half of each of their four matches in the WSL so far this season.Liverpool's start to the WSL season does not get any easier either. They travel to Manchester City for their next match on 30 October, while Arsenal host West Ham in London.""We've had a tough start to the season, we've played Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal, who all finished in the top five last year,"" Beard told BBC Sport. ""We've got Manchester City next week then we've got a run of games that will be against teams that will be in and around where we will be.""We have ambitions to do as well as we can in this league but we've got to realise that we've been out of it for two years and it's going to take time to adjust and adapt.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63274099

We've just got to get the selections right, keep the momentum going and keep rolling out the wins.""Defender Eve Perisset hit the crossbar with a shot from the edge of the box shortly after England put Chelsea ahead, but Brighton had several good chances in front of a crowd of 3,626 - a new record WSL attendance at Crawley's Broadfield Stadium.The Seagulls, who sit 10th on three points, were indebted to goalkeeper Megan Walsh for denying England and Charles with excellent saves during the first half.How Sunday's WSL games unfoldedChelsea earn hard-fought winHaving watched Arsenal and United win earlier on Sunday, Chelsea - who continue to be without manager Emma Hayes as she recovers from surgery - knew three points would be vital to avoid losing ground on the early leaders, who still have a game in hand on them.The evening had begun with players and staff taking an uncertain look at the sodden turf during a series of pitch inspections following thunder, lightning and downpours in the late afternoon.The conditions meant the ball rolled and bounced unpredictably, making both sides' willingness to take risks and play out from the back all the more admirable, with Brighton's Victoria Williams and Emma Kullberg notable for their nerveless composure.Green was wary of Brighton's tendency to trouble Chelsea in recent seasons, earning a point from this contest in January and ending their opponents' 33-match unbeaten run with a 2-1 win in February 2021.There was no shortage of confidence from Brighton from the off. On a pitch that would have tempted many defenders to indulge in long balls, Williams and her fellow defenders were dedicated to neat, composed passing - often under considerable pressure.Walsh was a loud and assured presence and Albion had their goalkeeper to thank on several occasions, showing alertness to paw Charles' header behind from a free-kick and tipping England's shot over the crossbar when it seemed destined for the roof of the net.The start of the second half began in end-to-end fashion before the classy England swept in on the line after another display of brave defending by Brighton almost kept them out.""I can't fault anyone's effort, attitude and application - I'm really pleased,"" said Seagulls manager Hope Powell.""I'm desperate for them to do well. The most important thing is that we create the chances and we did that today. We're desperately unlucky not to have got something out of the game.""Brighton can take encouragement from a performance that bodes well for their home game against Tottenham on 30 October, while Chelsea host Vllaznia in the Champions League and Aston Villa in the WSL before a potential top-of-the-table showdown at United on 6 November.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63274098

She had a great season last year but got overlooked a bit. She's the number nine now - she's a young player and there's a lot to come from her.""Shaw said: ""The position I play, the team look for me to score goals. I have been working on the training pitch perfecting what I am good at.""After 41 minutes in which City dominated but both sides lacked quality, Shaw made a scything run to the near post to meet Greenwood's driven set-piece and flick past international team-mate Becky Spencer.She then forced Angharad James into a mistake after 47 minutes, dispossessing the Spurs midfielder before slamming into the bottom corner from 25 yards past the wrong-footed Spencer for her 14th WSL goal in 13 league starts.Jamaica were given a tough group in Saturday's 2023 Women's World Cup draw, paired with France and Brazil in Group F. However, with 'Bunny' Shaw's finishing, they will have a chance.Brazil injury scuppers SpursEllie Brazil's injury caused a lengthy stoppage at the start of the gameThe game was overshadowed early on by a nasty looking injury to Tottenham striker Ellie Brazil, making her first WSL start for the club after joining from Brighton in the summer.Chasing an under-hit backpass, Brazil collided with City goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck and immediately hit the turf.Brazil, who has previously spent a year out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, was treated for several minutes and had to be taken off on a stretcher.Spurs created few clear chances throughout, and were beaten long before Hemp turned Amy Turner inside out before striking a low finish inside Spencer's far post.One positive for Spurs manager Rehanne Skinner was the return of Chioma Ubogagu, who was back on the bench for the first time after a nine-month ban for an anti-doping violation.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63267126

Full-back Jemma Purfield tested goalkeeper Emily Ramsey, on loan from Manchester United and making her Everton debut, when her free-kick was palmed away.But Everton were often in control of possession and got in behind the Leicester defence several times, though Izzy Christiansen and Jess Park were unable to link up.Striker Katja Snoeijs came close to getting on the end of one Christiansen delivery, before Gabby George fizzed in a dangerous ball from the left to test Leicester goalkeeper Levell.Everton substitutes Karen Holmgaard and Bennison made early impressions when they came on - both firing good efforts towards goal - while on-loan Arsenal winger Gio Queiroz also looked lively.The Toffees pushed for the winner in stoppage time and eventually it was teenager Bennison who stepped up to provide it, helped by goalkeeper Levell, who pushed the ball into her net when it looked likely to go wide of the post.It gave new Everton boss Brian Sorensen his second victory of the season, while Leicester made it three defeats from their opening three matches.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62784259

We grew into the game. It should have been more [goals] but it wasn't,"" said Chelsea manager Emma Hayes.""But I don't want to reflect on the things we didn't do. The season has just begun, I think we're performing like a team [in a season that] has just begun, trying to figure ourselves out.""There were positives for Chelsea as James, watched by brother and fellow England international Reece, was impressive again in a short appearance from the bench.Kerr, meanwhile, had a frustrating evening, but she caused plenty of problems for the West Ham defence.Lucy Parker, who earned her first England call-up on Tuesday, did well to keep her at bay for large periods but Kerr's quality was evident when she twice struck powerfully against the post.The Australia international eventually got her first goal of the season when West Ham failed to clear the ball in the box and it dropped kindly for Kerr to poke in from close range. Chelsea midfielder Guro Reiten had also came close, while Bright sent a header wide before netting the final goal in what ended up being a comfortable victory for the Blues.It was a second successive defeat for West Ham and manager Paul Konchesky said it was ""tough to take"" after conceding ""disappointing"" goals.""You know Chelsea's attacking power that they've got.

In the second half it was Chelsea who were in the ascendancy - James drove into the box from just beyond the halfway line and saw her shot well saved by Ellie Roebuck while Kirby had a similar chance to double the lead but shot over the bar.Leila Ouahabi's handball, which led to the penalty, might have been soft but was a just reward for Chelsea's second-half dominance. The hosts have now not lost to City in 11 WSL matches, winning five and drawing six.Chelsea show why they are defending championsFollowing Chelsea's 2-1 defeat by promoted Liverpool in their season opener, manager Emma Hayes said that her side ""couldn't hit a barn door"".They again squandered chances in the first half. Sam Kerr should have scored in the opening minute but poked Kirby's cut-back just wide. Then, when Kerr latched on to Steph Houghton's loose pass back to Roebuck, Chelsea looked certain to break the deadlock. However, the chance was missed when Kerr passed to Kirby instead of shooting herself and the England midfielder could not get a shot away.When Kirby did score it was largely against the run of play. City had played mostly for the previous 10 minutes in Chelsea's half and had 12 shots to their opponent's five, but the champions' clinical passing and speed on the break means you can never rule them out of a game. 'We were lucky' - reactionChelsea boss Hayes said her side were ""lucky"" in the first half after they struggled against City's pressing.""We overplayed and kept playing ourselves into trouble. We were playing out from the back in every situation and gave City the best chances,"" she said.""We were a bit tentative. Today was like the season opener - it looked like two teams that haven't got any momentum and sometimes that takes time. We were dominating by the second half, comfortable after a poor first half.""Hayes must now hope that her side can maintain their improvement after the upcoming international break - they next play at Everton on 16 October.""There are still transitions happening with us too but maybe the collective leadership in my group is further ahead than City,"" she added.Hayes does arguably have more experience in her group with City undergoing a more obvious period of change.They lost key players in the summer transfer window - Lucy Bronze, Georgia Stanway, Caroline Weir, Ellen White and record-transfer Keira Walsh - and City boss Gareth Taylor said Chelsea have ""experience of being successful"".Taylor added: ""It's an assumption that we're a new team with a lot of new players but I think we have good leadership and it comes in many forms.""City have now lost their first two games of the season after going on a run of 13 consecutive WSL wins to finish the last campaign.They have already failed to qualify for this season's Champions League group stage after losing to Real Madrid but Taylor said Sunday's performance ""gives us something to build on"".He said: ""It's not great but it is what it is.

547,Liverpool 0-3 Everton: Blues spoil rivals' Anfield WSL return,SUN 25 Sept 2022,womens-super-league,"Everton cruise to Merseyside derby victory at AnfieldEverton ruined Merseyside rivals Liverpool's day at Anfield and picked up their first win of the Women's Super League season.Defender Megan Finnigan gave Everton an early lead when she sent a header past goalkeeper Rachael Laws.The Blues were dominant and made it 2-0 when Jess Park coolly shifted the ball onto her left foot and slid it into the corner, before substitute Hanna Bennison scored a third late on to add salt to Liverpool's wounds.The derby was played out in front of 27,574, a record crowd for a WSL game at Anfield.Everton were deserving winners in this fierce derby as Liverpool struggled to make an impact and could not build on their stunning opening-weekend victory over defending champions Chelsea.The hosts were pinned back for most of the first half and though they improved after the break, they rarely tested goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan.Striker Katie Stengel and midfielder Ceri Holland missed big chances for Liverpool in the first half but Everton could also have extended their lead when Katja Snoeijs poked wide from close range.Blues defender Gabby George also headed a corner over the bar in the opening six minutes at Anfield, while Finnigan stung the fingers of Laws with a long-range strike shortly before breaking the deadlock.It was Everton's first victory under new manager Brian Sorensen and the sold-out away section of the crowd celebrated wildly at full-time.But the majority of the fans in attendance left with a familiar feeling of frustration as Everton claimed all three points in the derby for the second time at Anfield.The 27,574 in attendance beat the previous record set in the last meeting in 2019 when 23,500 watched Everton win 1-0.The game was marred by three incidents of pitch invasions from several members of the crowd with the players throwing their arms up in frustration.Confident Everton stamp their authority Liverpool came into this game full of confidence after their shock win over defending champions Chelsea on the opening weekend, following on from their success in the Women's Championship last season.In contrast, Everton had a poor 2021-22 season and got off to a disappointing start last weekend with defeat at West Ham.But it was the Blues who very quickly stamped their authority on the game, pushing Liverpool back and winning countless headers inside the box.It was only a matter of time before they opened the scoring and they went 2-0 up just as Liverpool had started to find their shape and were gaining success from a high press.Stengel's missed chance minutes before Park doubled Everton's lead was a significant moment and the Liverpool striker was at fault for giving the ball away needlessly in the build-up to the second goal.Liverpool boss Matt Beard had his head bowed at the half-time whistle but he could do little to change the outcome despite a change in shape for the hosts.Asked whether Liverpool's shape from the start had backfired, Beard said: ""It was a gamble that failed. Sometimes you make those decisions and sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.""The Reds pressed for a goal in the last few minutes as substitute Yana Daniels volleyed it straight at goalkeeper Brosnan, before Stengel stretched to head over the bar from close range.But Sorensen's side played with plenty of creativity and confidence - a promising sign for a club looking to bounce back from a topsy-turvy past 12 months - and Liverpool struggled to compete for large parts.Dane Sorensen hugged his staff and roared with delight when Bennison's late goal went in to confirm victory for Everton and fans will hope this first victory under him can help to build momentum. 'We executed gameplan to perfection' - reaction Liverpool manager Matt Beard: ""I thought Everton deserved to win. I'm disappointed with how we started. It was slow and we looked scared. We have to learn how to deal with these types of stadiums and crowds. Everton took full advantage of that. ""I don't want that to be the excuse though. We were disappointed with our performance. We finished the game well but we can't keep starting like we did today.""Everton manager Brian Sorensen: ""I am so happy for the girls.

The England forward made no mistake three minutes later, curling her shot in from outside the box into the top-right corner.Arsenal had confidence in abundance and were willing to shoot from all areas, Kim Little saw her effort from outside the box go just wide and Laura Wienroither also had a chance from long range.Spurs were sloppy in possession and Miedema latched on to a careless pass deep in the Spurs half to send the crowd wild for a second time.Arsenal were completely dominant and Souza leaped highest to nod home Mead's corner before Miedema glanced a header into the back of the net moments after the record attendance was announced over the sound system, with both greeted by rapturous applause.Arsenal have not conceded in their past eight WSL games and have scored 39 goals in their 10 wins, which go back to last season.The Gunners had 38 shots in their 4-0 win over Brighton on the opening weekend of the season and wave after wave of attack came again against Spurs, who were found wanting in possession and in attack.Mead brings Euros form into WSLMead was the top scorer and player of the tournament at the Women's Euros earlier this yearWatching Mead, who has now scored three goals in two games in the WSL this season, it is difficult to believe that she was left out of the Great Britain side for the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.After winning the Golden Boot and player of the tournament at Euro 2022, recording six goals and five assists, she has continued her exploits in the domestic season.Mead clearly relishes playing on the big stage and has proved herself time and again with her versatility and composure.Making her 100th WSL appearance for Arsenal, she was lively from the outset and with star striker Miedema also firing on all cylinders, despite admitting she is still recovering from Covid, the Gunners could be on track to avenge their heartbreak from the final day of last season, when they lost out on the WSL title by a point to London rivals Chelsea.Miedema scored 14 WSL goals last season, with Mead bagging 11, and the duo have picked up where they left off.Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall has strengthened his side with Sweden forward Lina Hurtig joining from Juventus in the summer, making Arsenal's forward line a frightening prospect for opponents.Gunners impress record crowd47,367 watch Arsenal's game against Tottenham at Emirates StadiumFollowing England's Euros victory, the main question has been around whether the support will sustain in the women's game.With the WSL attendance record increased by nearly 10,000 and attendances up at other matches so far this season, the momentum is set to continue.With no separate stand for away fans, Gunners supporters dominated all areas of the 60,000-capacity stadium and made their presence known throughout, with deafening cries of ""Arsenal, Arsenal"" as they delighted in their side's confidence.Arsenal are one of four WSL clubs playing in their club's main stadium this weekend, meaning the record combined attendance for a round of matches is set to be broken.The Gunners will play another five games at Emirates Stadium during the season.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62937304

""She was unwell yesterday and this morning. We didn't know after team breakfast if she was going to play and she's gone out and produced that today.""She's a winner, she sets standards, she gets after people but she can play for sure.""Daly said: ""It's a dream start. Getting on the scoresheet not once but twice is obviously nice, but more importantly getting a win at home against one of the top teams in this league.""We wanted to be brave, take risks, create chances and make this a horrible place to play and I think we did that.""It proved to be a difficult opening period for Gareth Taylor's City side, who welcomed back captain Steph Houghton from a long-term Achilles injury but initially struggled to find their rhythm as they adjusted to the loss of Keira Walsh in a world-record deal and several other star players this summer.Daly's tackle on Spanish midfielder Laia Aleixandri played a major part in the opening goal, allowing Swiss striker Alisha Lehmann to drive into the City area and fire into the bottom left corner. The hosts deservedly doubled their lead when Daly expertly curled a right-foot effort into the top corner after City had failed to clear their lines.However, a mistake by Villa goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, who tipped a Laura Coombs shot over her own line, was the catalyst for a City fightback. Khadija Shaw headed in a leveller from Houghton's nod back across goal and less than 90 seconds later Coombs drove in Chloe Kelly's cross to put the visitors ahead.But in a see-saw encounter France midfielder Kenza Dali equalised for Ward's side with a deflected effort from 20 yards, before Daly prodded in her second of the game to round off the scoring and inflict a first opening-day defeat on City for eight years.Follow live coverage from Sunday's WSL matchesCity adjust to life without LionessesAfter finishing third last season City boss Taylor has stressed that the club's focus is on winning a first WSL title since 2016, but his team served up the sort of showing that suggests it may instead be a year of transition.With Ellen White, Jill Scott and Karen Bardsley's retirements, Lucy Bronze and Walsh heading to Barcelona and Georgia Stanway and Caroline Weir also departing to Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, there was an unfamiliar feel and look to City's starting XI.For all the positives attached to their stirring recovery from 2-0 down to lead 3-2, Taylor will also be aware that the loss of five Lionesses, in particular midfielders Walsh and Stanway, were keenly felt. The use of Aleixandri, a summer signing from Atletico Madrid, away from her normal defensive berth did not work and while Japan midfielder Yui Hasegawa was unavailable, she offers a different type of solution further up the pitch.  Another new signing Mary Fowler came on with City chasing the game but both her introduction and that of fellow striker Deyna Castellanos did little provide the balance that appeared to be missing at times. ""It's a tough start, it's not the start we wanted but we've been in tough positions before and we'll fight back, roll our sleeves up and get back to work next week,"" Taylor said.In contrast Villa, who were without several regulars themselves including captain Remi Allen, appeared to reap the benefits of a bold summer transfer window. And this performance, along with the recruitment of Daly, Dali, Danielle Turner, Rachel Corsie, Kirsty Hanson and Anna Patten suggests they may be capable of improving upon their ninth-place finish last term.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62866709

Leicester, who just avoided relegation last season, started their second top-flight campaign with purpose but failed to make it count before Neville broke the deadlock ten minutes before the break with a stunning finish from 35 yards.Driving forward into acres of space, she unleashed a strike that looped over Kirstie Levell in the Foxes goal.Suddenly, the visitors were in full control. Levell denied Jess Naz from close range before Spence struck on the brink of half-time, arrowing a shot into the bottom left corner.Spence's afternoon took a turn for the worse 13 minutes after the restart when she turned a corner into her own net under pressure from Sophie Howard, halving the deficit for Leicester.Roared on by a raucous King Power crowd the home side went in search of an equaliser, but just like the first half, struggled to find a cutting edge to level it up.Spence proves worth despite mixed displayIt may have been her error which opened the door for a late Leicester onslaught, but Spence made a positive impact in her first WSL game since her move from Chelsea.The midfielder offered a different dimension to Rehanne Skinner's side's attacking output, helping them take control of the game after a positive start from Leicester.She could have opened the scoring earlier had she connected properly with the ball from within the area, but made up for it with her stunning long-range effort to double Spurs' lead. She seldom wasn't involved either, stamping her authority on proceedings from the middle of the park.Coming from Chelsea, Spence is used to winning, and on this early evidence she could be the difference in the north Londoners' fight for Champions League football this season.Closing the gap to the top three will be high on Spurs' agenda this season, having finished fifth last term, 15 points behind Manchester City, who took the final European spot.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62866710

Until then both sides had struggled to create clear-cut opportunities under their new managers.Everton's best chance came when Risa Shimizu flicked the ball past her own goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold late on. Follow live updates from the Women's Super LeagueThe Japan defender was one of five players, along with Kirsty Smith, Jess Ziu, Viviane Asseyi and her international team-mate Honoka Hayashi, to be handed their Hammers debut from the start by the former Hammers and Charlton full-back Konchesky. Konchesky, assistant to Olli Harder last term, saw his team defend stoutly while there were glimpses of promise from France international Asseyi - an exciting summer acquisition from Bayern Munich - and Hayashi, who went close with one fierce 20-yard drive.It proved a disappointing day for Everton and their highly regarded new manager Brian Sorensen. While his team dominated possession there was very little end product and it is clear that he will need time to mould them into an attacking force, with the likes of Simone Magill, Anna Anvegard, Claire Emslie and Kenza Dali all departing the club this summer. Vastly experienced Denmark defender Katrine Veje looked accomplished on her debut at right-back and teenage forward Aggie Beever-Jones took up some excellent positions without threatening.  And Sorensen should also be given some credit for altering the flow of the game towards the visitors with Izzy Christiansen, summer loan recruit Jess Park and new signing Gio all coming on as they chased an equaliser.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62866711
552,Liverpool 2-1 Chelsea: Late comeback spoils Chelsea's title defence opener,SUN 18 Sept 2022,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights: Newly-promoted Liverpool come from behind to beat champions Chelsea 2-1Chelsea manager Emma Hayes said her side ""couldn't hit a barn door"" as the defence of their Women's Super League title got off to the worst start with defeat at newly promoted Liverpool.Liverpool striker Katie Stengel scored two penalties in the second half to send a record crowd at Prenton Park into a frenzy.Fran Kirby had given Chelsea the lead within three minutes of kick-off from the penalty spot before the hosts mounted a stunning comeback.""They scored from a throw-in which was a penalty and a transition which was another penalty,"" said Hayes. ""It's not like in open play they've had lots of shots; they've just maximised the situations and for us going forwards I don't think we could hit a barn door today.""Chelsea are bidding to win a fourth successive WSL title this season, while two-time champions Liverpool are back in the top flight after a two-year absence. Matt Beard's side were made to work hard for their victory but Stengel's double was cheered deliriously by the 3,006 in attendance at Prenton Park - the most for a Liverpool women's game.""Going forwards we weren't good enough. Even at the end, the crosses into the box, nothing went where it was supposed to go,"" added Hayes.""Sometimes we always want to win things by bigger margins rather than follow the process, keep passing the football. ""I've been here before and we just chalk it off and go again.""Chelsea seemed to be in good fortune when Liverpool debutant Gilly Flaherty clipped Guro Reiten in the box to give away a penalty in less than 60 seconds.Kirby kept her cool and Chelsea began to dominate possession, though Liverpool carried a threat in attack.Leanne Kiernan hit the post but was offside in the first half, while new signing Emma Koivisto poked a rebound over the bar from a few yards out.But Chelsea appeared in control as Sam Kerr won countless headers in the final third and the movement of the Blues' midfield caused problems.Kerr had a goal disallowed for offside when she thumped in a half-volley from the edge of the box before Scotland international Erin Cuthbert struck an effort inches wide.Emma Hayes' side started where they left off after the break, but Millie Bright was penalised harshly for a handball in the box before Chelsea's new signing Kadeisha Buchanan gave away a foul for a second Liverpool penalty in 20 minutes. It was the perfect way for Liverpool to mark their return to the WSL under manager Beard, who guided them to back-to-back titles the last time he was in charge in this league.""There shouldn't be any hesitancy anymore. We should be in a position where we know we can compete at this level,"" said Beard. ""We frustrated Chelsea, one of the best teams in club football.""Stengel delivers as Chelsea stutterLiverpool's return to the top flight was witnessed by a record crowd of 3,006 at Prenton ParkChelsea's defeat came on a day when Aston Villa beat Manchester City 4-3 at Villa Park, making for an explosive start to the WSL season.The visitors were full of creativity and movement but lacked a ruthless edge in the final third - harmed by the late withdrawal of forward Pernille Harder who sustained a slight niggle in the warm-up.Liverpool took time to settle into the game as the intensity of Chelsea's switch of play and fluidity in midfield caused problems.But as the game wore on and Beard had gathered his players in at half-time, Liverpool started to find confidence and played more on the front foot in the second half.Stengel, who scored on her home debut for Liverpool last season, stepped up impressively to put away both penalties in front of the Kop to mark a superb WSL debut.It was a marker of Liverpool's intent this season as they hope to do more than just consolidate a place in the league.""It's stupid to ever say you just want to stay in the league. We're here to compete, we're not just here to survive,"" said Stengel. ""Let's make a run for it. We're in the league to win each game. We won't go into any game just wanting to be here and be happy. ""We want to stay humble, confident and believe in ourselves so we can grow throughout the season. Let's finish as high as we can.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62866708

The Guernsey-born England youth international impressed at Brighton and was wanted by champions Chelsea in the transfer market.United signed her to solidify their backline, but she offered just as much of an attacking threat in this game.Zelem's set-pieces, such a weapon for United last season, were once again superb and Le Tissier will fancy her chances of adding to her tally throughout the campaign with that service.Zelem had a memorable 100th game for United, while the fans were given what many had paid to see - a goal from Euro 2022 star Russo.Fans queued outside the stadium's entrance for at least two hours before kick-off to welcome the players, with England midfielder Toone given a particularly warm reception.Toone and Russo were a threat and both missed chances to extend United's lead, but their contribution this season will undoubtedly play a key role in the quest for Champions League football.There was little for Reading supporters to cheer, although Scotland defender Emma Mukandi - formerly 'Mitchell' - returned from maternity leave to captain the side for the first time.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62859250

Arsenal's title credentials may depend upon the pair's ruthlessness at the goalmouth.Fans thrilled to see stars againThe postponement of the first round of WSL fixtures last weekend meant several teams did not begin their seasons in huge stadiums.Arsenal are set to be part of a record-breaking north London derby attendance for a women's game when they host Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium on 24 September, but the 3,238 fans in the more modest Meadow Park provided a passionate atmosphere for their first home match of the campaign.Supporters were waiting outside the gates before they opened and a club shop to the corner of the North Bank - a name synonymous with Arsenal thanks to the famous old stand at their former home of Highbury - attracted a queue throughout the build-up.It wasn't long before chants of ""Meado"" and ""Mead will tear you apart"" went up, ringing out after shirts bearing her name had traded briskly from behind the counter.This was an occasion that would have felt very different for Mead and her fellow Lionesses to the packed Wembley where they had played their glorious previous competitive match.The adoration they absorbed was just as devoted, though - as was the renewed buoyancy of the women's game following an unforgettable summer.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62845786

It was a good performance from the hosts, who threatened throughout - Jess Naz firing over the bar after Kerys Harrop had a cross clawed off the goalline in the second half.Chelsea grew into the game in the second half as Millie Bright sent a fizzing strike over before Kerr was denied from close range.And the league leaders showed their clinical edge when Kerr headed in Jonna Andersson's cross and Fleming thumped in a stunning third to complete the comeback.""I don't think I've been in a position where there is as much pressure as there currently is,"" Cuthbert added. ""It's the most exciting year it's ever been since I've been at Chelsea. Teams are pushing us all the way. Arsenal have done a great job this season but we've really fought back.

Deciding to go aerially, goalkeeper Mary Earps pumped the ball long to set free Leah Galton, who picked out Thomas in the middle, but the out-of-sorts forward could only guide the ball past the post.Villa managed six shots, compared to United's 18, and this result will hurt the visitors far more.

It looked like we just wanted the game to end.""But you can't play football with fear and I'm happy we scored the fourth goal.""In Miedema, Arsenal have the league's crowning talent and she oozed class throughout. Her 100 goal contributions comprise 70 goals and 30 assists since her arrival in 2017.While she described her 10th of the season as ""an ugly goal"", it is more than Birmingham had scored in total in the WSL this season before the game.Arsenal's defeat by the Blues eight weeks ago was the shock result of the campaign, but it remains the only victory of a difficult season for Darren Carter's team.Birmingham struggled to create anything yet found some spirit in the last 15 minutes to punish defensive complacency from their hosts, Smith bundling home and Quinn threatening a spectacular comeback with a fine finish.Eidevall's side looked nervous as Birmingham hunted an unlikely point, but broke away and clinched the points as Foord fired home in stoppage time.

The levels of commitment remain high.""Hayes added: ""Most importantly, they're learning and understanding our way of playing.""Chelsea ended the calendar year unbeaten in 18 home games and will discover their quarter-final opponents when the draw is made on 10 February.The visitors, who had also already qualified, started brightly as they chased the two-goal win they needed to finish top and provide an upset for the second-highest home attendance at an English club ever recorded in the Women's Champions League.Kadidiatou Diani's spectacular early effort almost put the Division 1 Feminine leaders ahead, forcing the backpedalling Zecira Musovic to tip her arrowed 40-yard drive on to the crossbar.Relive the action as Chelsea swept to victory in their group stage finalePSG's belief was punctured two minutes before the break when Kerr opened the scoring with a rocket of a strike that looked as composed as it was sublime.Chelsea swiftly doubled their lead in the second half, James starting and finishing the move by pouncing on a misplaced pass inside the penalty area and providing the final touch following a slick interchange linking Fran Kirby and Kerr.Kirby set up James' second seven minutes later, locating her in front of goal after seizing on a perceptive Guro Reiten pass.English leaders light up Champions LeagueA year and six days ago, Chelsea crashed out of the Champions League with a 4-0 mauling at Wolfsburg in the group stage that left manager Emma Hayes rueing ""really, really difficult moments"" for her Covid-stricken squad.They are in rude health entering the Christmas interlude this year, reflected by their first European victory at Stamford Bridge - exorcising the memory of a 3-0 defeat by Wolfsburg in their only previous game at the men's stadium in the competition.They persisted in punishing PSG despite their opponents' attempt to turn the tide with a string of substitutions, refusing to let up and almost adding a fourth at the end when a classy Kirby volley hit a post.Chelsea's collective focus on their warm winter training camp will turn to the potentially pivotal game facing them on their return, when the WSL leaders face their closest challengers.Arsenal signalled their own intent in Europe by winning their Champions League group with a 9-1 rout of Zurich on Wednesday, and their next incentive is to draw level on points with Chelsea by ending their opponents' nine-game winning run in the league with victory at Emirates Stadium on 15 January.If either side can continue with the serene confidence they have shown on the continent this week, there could be more than a domestic title in sight for the WSL's top two.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64056765

We had the opportunity to close [conversations on] last year. The questions in and around the group stage last year - we don't have to answer any more,"" said Hayes. ""This team does so well to learn in its hardest moments. We understand what the group stage is in this competition and I think we've navigated them really well this season.""On a wet night in Albania, Wales midfielder Sophie Ingle put Chelsea 1-0 up after 12 minutes when she coolly struck into the bottom corner from Guro Reiten's deflected cutback. Fran Kirby doubled the lead shortly afterwards when she was slipped in by Jelena Cankovic, who acted quickly and Vllaznia were slow to react to a free-kick.Substitute Katerina Svitkova headed in a third goal late on, before Maren Mjelde also came off the bench to score from the penalty spot in added time.The Blues, who beat Vllaznia 8-0 in the reverse fixture in October, made light work of their progression to the knockout stages despite being drawn in a tricky group alongside Spanish side Real Madrid and French two-time finalists Paris St-Germain.They were guaranteed qualification with a draw against Vllaznia - and could still have progressed in defeat depending on results elsewhere.But the already eliminated Albanian side were no match for Chelsea on a wet evening at Loro Borici Stadium, despite plenty of endeavour from the hosts.'Competition for places will get even fiercer'Hayes made six changes to the starting XI and Ingle, wearing the captain's armband, was heavily involved in the first half, dictating play and scoring a fine opening goal.The Blues' defence was rarely tested, and chances continued to fall their way as Hayes made further changes after the break.Striker Sam Kerr had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before the lead was eventually extended when substitutes Svitkova and Mjelde added the finishing touches.It was another display of Chelsea's growing squad depth and Hayes expects competition for places in her side to get ""even fiercer"" in the new year as their summer signings continue to develop.""Our depth has always been a strength of ours, but the quality in the way we control games now is different than in previous years,"" added Hayes.""Having the depth means we can train at a higher level. It's less about rotation in games. It's about quality training and making sure the players are being pushed to go to a higher level. ""You can have a large squad and not necessarily have good quality but we have both. The [summer signings] impress me more and more and I'm starting to see every new player find their feet.""Chelsea now go into their final group match against PSG next Thursday knowing their spot in the last eight is already secure.They join WSL rivals Arsenal in the quarter-finals after they secured qualification on Thursday evening despite a narrow defeat by holders Lyon.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64007285

608,Arsenal 0-1 Lyon: Defeat for Gunners but they qualify for quarter-finals,THU 15 Dec 2022,womens-champions-league,"Miedema has scored three goals in seven Champions League games this season.Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall said he was ""very concerned"" by a serious-looking injury to Vivianne Miedema during their Women's Champions League defeat to Lyon.The Gunners qualified for the quarter-finals despite defeat but it came at a cost as Miedema was taken off on a stretcher on the stroke of half-time. The 26-year-old Dutch forward was quickly surrounded by team-mates when she fell awkwardly off the ball, before receiving medical attention and having her leg heavily strapped.""I don't know [how bad it is]. I haven't spoken to her or the doctor,"" said Eidevall immediately after the match. ""I don't have any updates but right now that takes a lot of my thoughts. I'm very concerned over that, but we had to stay focused on the game.""After the game we are concerned but [at half-time] we are super professional, we don't let anything take away our focus from what we are doing.""The Gunners top Group C with a game remaining, but it was not a celebratory evening at Emirates Stadium.A quiet first half ended badly for Arsenal when Frida Maanum's own goal gave Lyon the lead, moments before Miedema left the pitch in tears on a stretcher.Who needs what in the Women's Champions League group stagesMiedema 'did not feel appreciated by Ballon d'Or'Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Arsenal, who stunned the holders 5-1 in Lyon in October, searched for an equaliser in the second half and almost found it in the final minute of normal time when a corner was scrambled off the line and Stina Blackstenius' strike was saved at the near post.But Arsenal goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger was called into action to parry away a powerful strike by Lyon substitute Eugenie Le Sommer and the French giants carried a threat throughout. Eidevall's side go into their final match with Zurich on 21 December knowing a place in the last eight is sealed but victory will earn top spot in the group.""That's what's important. That we go to Zurich and we win, and we be the number one in the group,"" added the Swede.Arsenal's progression in the competition has been smooth but the latest injury to Miedema - while Ballon d'Or runner-up Beth Mead is already sidelined with an ACL injury - means qualification comes at a cost.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63976971

""It was a poor team performance, in and out of possession we were asleep. I made two half-time changes, I could have taken anyone off.""I thought it was a great response in second half, we could have won it - it was a point gained but a disappointing performance.""Unusual Berger mistake costs ChelseaChelsea entered this game with a perfect group stage record, including a 2-0 victory over Madrid at Kingsmeadow two weeks ago. Another win here would have seen them surpass their disappointing 2021 campaign where they failed to get out of the group.While much of the focus on Chelsea goes to their star-studded front line, goalkeeper Berger has been just as crucial to their strong European form, not conceding a goal in the 2022-23 Champions League before tonight.The German may have been unsettled by treatment she needed to her foot just minutes before the Madrid opener, but whatever the reason it was an uncharacteristic error as she attempted to pass the ball into midfield.Instead she only found ex-Manchester City midfielder Weir, who gratefully accepted the gift and slotted into the empty net from 22 yards.This was the second time Weir has found the net against a Women's Super League side after leaving City in the summer, having scored the only goal to eliminate her old side from the Champions League in qualifying.Chelsea were sloppy in midfield and while they dominated possession, 61% in the first 70 minutes, often gave the ball away in good positions.Hayes said after the game: ""Technically I've never seen us give ball away so cheap, in good positions we were overhitting the ball, erratic in front of goal - we struggled in all positions.""Chelsea lost the ball just outside their own box with 10 minutes to go, leaving Carmona to break through - only for Berger to make a fine spreading save, a timely reminder of her importance and ability.""She knows things happen, but it was a big save when we needed her to make it,"" Hayes said of her goalkeeper.Sam Kerr missed three clear chances on a frustrating eveningBlues get lucky with bizarre penaltyChelsea manager Hayes described the win over Madrid two weeks ago as a ""cagey affair"" - there was no such caution here as the Blues hit the woodwork three times, with the final one falling in their favour.They should have led inside two minutes when an Erin Cuthbert header from a corner was palmed away by Misa and fell to Sam Kerr who thumped the ball off the crossbar when she should have scored.It was an off night for Kerr, who spurned a similarly clear opening half an hour later. The Australian was put through one-on-one against Misa by Lauren James, but pulled her shot onto the outside of the right post.Hayes said of Kerr: ""I'd be more worried if we didn't create chances. It wasn't our best performance and we still got a point.""Instead it took an immense stroke of fortune for Chelsea to equalise, after Ivana Andres clumsily brought down Reiten in the area.The Norwegian took the spot-kick which hit the keeper's right-hand post - only to deflect back off Misa's back and roll agonisingly over the line.Kerr could have won it for Chelsea in the final minutes - and put her side into the quarter-finals - however she was denied one-on-one again by a superb save from Misa.The 2021 finalists look likely to make amends this season for their group-stage elimination in 2021-22, but this must count as a wake-up call.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63896139

""In the last two games here, we've seen some brilliant stuff from her both in attack and defence.""The weight of her passes and her touches, it's extraordinary how well she's doing things like that. ""If we finished a bit better, we would talk of her having multiple assists in these games as well and not only scoring goals. I'm very happy for her that she is able to show these performances.""Since Manchester United ended Arsenal's 14-game winning run in the WSL in November, she has provided Arsenal's only three goals.Before her strike proved the difference on Wednesday she scored the only goal against Everton in the league on Saturday, while her header in Italy secured a point against Juventus a fortnight ago.The Dutch forward was granted a leave of absence in November and spoke this week about the importance of players not being afraid to take breaks should they need to.It seems that break has worked a treat as their all-time top goalscorer looked her usual dynamic self, dropping deep to win the ball back and creating chances.England captain Leah Williamson started her first match since returning from a foot injury and Rafaelle Souza replaced her in the second half, making her first appearance on her comeback from injury.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63878841

We've come from a really tough game against United and are getting back to our way of playing against a tough team.""Gunners need Miedema to shine in Mead's absenceDespite United putting the first dent in Arsenal's record this season, the Gunners will arguably have been more disappointed to see their talismanic forward Beth Mead, who has scored five goals in all competitions this season, go off in tears at the end of that match.The disappointment will have increased with the news Mead had suffered an ACL injury and is now set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines.The Gunners squad was notably thin in Turin, with Leah Williamson, Lina Hurtig, Kim Little and Rafaelle Souza all also absent.Arsenal boss Eidevall said his side are in a ""tough situation"" with the amount of injuries, but some of his squad could return for the reverse fixture at Emirates Stadium on 7 December.Blackstenius was energetic in the first half but lacked a cutting edge and Arsenal will hope Miedema can now propel herself into the form that has seen her become the club's all-time leading goalscorer with 132 goals.The 26-year-old smashed two chances over the bar in the final 10 minutes, having only returned from a leave of absence in time for the game against United.""I'm very pleased with her goal, it's always about finding the balance with freshness and having continuity in training and play,"" added Eidevall.""You can see that Viv was fighting hard today with the team on the pitch and that's what we need.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63737086

I think that learning from previous years and learning from losing in the final [against Barcelona in 2021] helped.""Following a drab first half, the Blues took the lead through Sophie Ingle's 67th-minute header after Millie Bright flicked on a corner.Erin Cuthbert's dipping cross sealed the points with 15 minutes left, catching out goalkeeper Misa Rodriguez.Relive Chelsea's Champions League win over Real MadridBlues canter home at expectant KingsmeadowChelsea, who returned to the top of the Women's Super League on Sunday after beating Tottenham at Stamford Bridge, came into the match leading the group, two points ahead of unbeaten Real Madrid.After a 1-0 win over Paris St-Germain and an 8-0 victory against Vllaznia in their two other Champions League matches, a bouncing Kingsmeadow crowd was expectant.They came close through Fran Kirby's early curling effort in an otherwise uneventful first half.With 25 minutes to go there was a nervous energy at Kingsmeadow with Real Madrid growing into the game, but that was soon replaced with relief after Ingle's opener.And Chelsea nearly added a third through two Niamh Charles efforts at the death as they cantered to victory.Hayes praised her side's maturity, adding: ""I think a couple of years ago we'd have got impatient, especially in the first half.""It was a calm dressing room at half-time. When these two teams are so relatively matched, I'm starting to see the importance of our experience. ""We certainly play better European football, we're becoming more accustomed to it.""Scotland international and ex-Manchester City midfielder Caroline Weir was unable to find the perfect pass for the visitorsReal Madrid second-best in LondonThis was the first meeting between Chelsea and Real Madrid, but Las Blancas boast a fine record against English teams in the Champions League having knocked out Manchester City for the second consecutive season in August's qualifiers.The visitors came to west London having only lost once this campaign, against Barcelona in the Primera Division where they sit third in the table.And though they struggled in the opening exchanges, last year's quarter-finalists grew into the game as Esther Gonzalez saw a fierce shot blocked shortly after the restart.But it was to be their only meaningful effort, with Chelsea the better side on Hayes' first game back at Kingsmeadow since recovering from surgery.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63720058

622,Arsenal 3-1 Zurich: Lena Hurtig scores two in win that maintains perfect Champions League start,THU 27 Oct 2022,womens-champions-league,"Jordan Nobbs made her first start of the season for Arsenal, marking it with the first goalArsenal firmly established their lead at the top of Women's Champions League Group C with a comfortable victory over Swiss champions Zurich at Emirates Stadium.Jordan Nobbs scored a stunning volley to break the deadlock in the first half before Lina Hurtig flicked a header over the goalkeeper to make it 2-0.A thumping strike from Seraina Piubel gave Zurich hope in the 76th minute but Hurtig doubled her tally to seal victory for Arsenal just two minutes later.Jonas Eidevall's side have made the perfect start to their European campaign with two wins from two games.Last week's impressive 5-1 victory over holders Lyon put Arsenal in a strong position in their group and this victory put them two points clear of second-placed Juventus, who drew 1-1 with Lyon earlier on Thursday.However, Arsenal manager Eidevall said ""nothing is won yet"".""I am happy with the result but we have only played two games. There is nothing won yet. We are happy with that but there are a lot of tough games left,"" he added.""It doesn't matter [about the draw between Juventus and Lyon]. It doesn't change anything. Things can turn out in a lot of different ways. We will see where we end up.""It was not quite the ""beautiful"" night Arsenal experienced in France but it was a routine victory on home soil as they broke down a stubborn defensive block from Zurich.Defender Jen Beattie came close early on with a header, but the visitors held out for 38 minutes before a moment of real quality set Arsenal on their way.Steph Catley's curling cross from the left picked out Nobbs, making her first start of the season, and the England midfielder finished perfectly with a sidefooted volley in off the underside of the crossbar.Arsenal quickly doubled their lead when Mana Iwabuchi's creation set-up Hurtig.  Japan international Iwabuchi has had to bide her time for minutes this season, coming on for just seconds in last Sunday's Women's Super League victory over Liverpool, before making her first start in this game, but she dazzled in patches and was heavily involved.She had an effort saved in the second half before being substituted in the 74th minute.Zurich had little possession but did test Arsenal goalkeeper Kaylan Marckese, making her debut, with efforts from Naomi Megroz and Nadine Riesen in the first half.Their best chance prior to scoring fell to Piubel seconds after the restart but she dragged the shot inches wide. She made up for it later on, chesting down an excellent Eleni Markou pass, firing it past goalkeeper Marckese and sprinting away to the touchline in wild celebration.Zurich's goal celebrations were short lived, however, as Arsenal went up another gear to see the game off - substitute Stina Blackstenius' strike rebounded straight into Hurtig's path and she tapped it in.""It was just wonderful to be here in this fantastic stadium. It's something you work for every day to have that opportunity,"" said Zurich boss Inka Grings following the defeat.""Ninety per cent of our team still have a full-time job, so just to be here was a huge honour for us. We were clear it wasn't a holiday though. ""We wanted to be able to keep up with Arsenal and to score a goal and that is what we achieved.""Arsenal are now unbeaten in eight matches in all competitions this season, winning seven of them, and they are in a strong position to progress from the group stages of the Champions League.Hurtig at the double as Nobbs takes her chanceSweden striker Hurtig joined from Juventus in August but has faced strong competition for a starting place given Arsenal's attacking quality.She has shown her ability in spells this season but finally got her first Gunners goals here.""What you get from Lina is a wide forward that can produce a lot of goals and assists in maybe a different way than some of our other players,"" said Eidevall.""Her highs are so high. It's about her believing in them all the time. I think those two goals will help her even more. ""The 27-year-old was lively from the start, linking up with Iwabuchi and Beth Mead, but was unable to find the finishing touch.It eventually came after Iwabuchi weaved into the box with neat footwork but Hurtig still had plenty to do as she readjusted her head to flick the ball over the goalkeeper from a tight angle.She grew into the game even more in the second half too as compatriot Blackstenius set her up for her second goal and the two combined on several occasions - Blackstenius should have scored late on when she was through one-on-one with the keeper but chipped it over the bar.Hurtig's performance showed the level of squad depth available to Eidevall this season, with Nobbs another player who sparkled on a rare start. ""This game really came at a moment where we needed to trust the whole squad. It's nice. It's the Champions League so everything is at stake and I hope the players feel that and that we trust them,"" said Eidevall.""When you put players on in a Champions League game it's because you trust them. I've been really happy with how people have been training and how the spirit has been.""Nobbs' sublime volley was the catalyst for Arsenal to build confidence in the game and she was creative throughout. She will be keen to maintain the same levels of performance in the coming months as she tries to force her way into Sarina Wiegman's England squad for the World Cup in 2023.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63398966

They backed up their impressive victory over Paris St-Germain last week with a comfortable win at Kingsmeadow, against opponents cheered on by 420 fans travelling as part of Vllaznia's official supporters' allocation.""It was always going to be important to follow-up last week's result in Paris. We did that very convincingly,"" said Chelsea general manager Paul Green. ""It puts us in a good position in the group but there's still a long way to go as it's only matchweek two. There's still a lot of work to be done to ensure we go through to the latter stages. ""We have made a great start though.""The Albanian fans - despite being outnumbered in the overall crowd of 3,022 - were in terrific voice as they supported their side, competing in the group stages of the Women's Champions League for the first time. They chanted throughout, cheering Chelsea's missed chances and waving flags before throwing a flare on to the field and causing a brief stop in play late on.""I loved it. I thought it was awesome. I thought about stirring them up but didn't want them to take it the wrong way,"" Kerr joked.""I think that's what makes football so great. When I scored the second goal down there, I was thinking about it… I thought they were excellent.""Vllaznia were backed by more than 400 fans at KingsmeadowHowever, it was Chelsea who dominated on the pitch, with Kerr and Harder in clinical form and Reiten heavily involved in creation.Substitute Svitkova joined in on the action when she headed in her first goal in Chelsea colours since signing from West Ham in the summer.This was Chelsea's third match in a week and they made seven changes from their Women's Super League victory over Brighton on Sunday.Kerr was able to come off having scored four goals in just over an hour, while England international Fran Kirby made a welcome return off the bench after recovering from illness.Chelsea host Aston Villa in their next Women's Super League match on Sunday and they welcome Real Madrid in their next Champions League game on 23 November.Kerr enjoys herself as goals flowKerr was the WSL's top scorer last season with 20 goals for Chelsea - but heading into this match, she had just one goal from five games to her name this season.She looked hungry to increase her tally against the group's lowest-ranked side and she did not take long to open her account, dinking the ball coolly over the goalkeeper after Harder's incisive pass.Reiten was the provider for Kerr's next three goals, though the hat-trick goal was originally awarded to captain Magdalena Eriksson following a corner.Kerr, who clearly made contact with the header, smiled as she tried to correct the referee but saved her familiar backflip celebration for her fourth goal. She said: ""[The backflip] wasn't on my mind but at half-time Millie [Bright] said: 'If you score the hat-trick can you please do it?'""I haven't done a backflip here in a long time and this was my first in the Champions League. Scoring my first Champions League hat-trick is a night I will remember forever.""Kerr also had a disallowed goal in the first half - again set-up by Reiten - and general manager Green hopes it will give her confidence to add to her tally in the WSL.""Sam is a born goalscorer. She has won the Golden Boot in the last few years. We had no doubt she would score goals this season,"" said Green. ""Scoring four tonight will give her confidence and hopefully she can be on the scoresheet again this weekend. We haven't been worried about that at all. ""She is certainly one of the world's best strikers. She is very important to us and has proven that over the time she has been with us.""Former Netherlands striker Marco van Basten was the first man to score four goals in a Champions League group game 30 years ago, but Kerr has now become the first woman to do so.""Three games is a long time for me [not to score]! It was nice. I'm paid to score goals but I also think I bring a lot when I'm not scoring too,"" said Kerr.""It's about being patient and getting into my groove and I did that tonight. Hopefully I can do the same against Villa.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63390885

629,PSG 0-1 Chelsea: Win 'shows how far English game has come',THU 20 Oct 2022,womens-champions-league,"Chelsea defender Millie Bright produced the game's only goalChelsea general manager Paul Green says the wins from English sides in Europe this week shows how far the domestic game has come.A first-half volley from defender Millie Bright secured Chelsea victory over PSG in their opener in the Women's Champions League group stages, while Arsenal laid down a marker with a 5-1 thrashing of European champions Lyon on Wednesday.And Green, who is taking charge of media duties while head coach Emma Hayes is absent, thinks such results would have been ""unthinkable"" only a few years ago.He said: ""I think it shows how far the English league has come that ourselves and Arsenal have come to the top two teams in France and got two victories. ""I think it's a really positive thing for the English league and does show how far it's come. Relive Chelsea's win over PSGGo straight to all of our women's football content""In years gone by, it was probably unthinkable that teams would come to France and win games like this.""""Women's football is riding the crest of a wave after the Euros. Players coming back into club environments are bringing positivity with them, so that's part of it.""Centre-back Bright, who helped England to win Euro 2022 in July, volleyed home from close range after latching on to a well-timed Erin Cuthbert cross to give Chelsea a crucial three points.They didn't produce many more clear-cut chances but were rarely threatened.Chelsea failed to reach the knockout stages last year but a strong defensive performance helped them beat last year's semi-finalists.Chelsea kicked off their Champions League campaign with victory in ParisNo British club has won the Champions League since Arsenal lifted the trophy in 2007.But Green believes that the Women's Super League's status as a full-time division has aided English side's abilities to compete in Europe.""I think it's well-documented that to be in the WSL you have to be a full-time team. Our games week in, week out are high-intensity games. Any team can beat anyone else on any given day as we've already seen in this season's competition. I think it does help ourselves and Arsenal going into Europe.""The Blues continue to be without Hayes, who is recovering from an emergency hysterectomy as part of her ""ongoing battle with endometriosis"".They were also without creative forward Fran Kirby for the trip to Paris.But they stepped up to the task at hand on Thursday night, despite the hostile atmosphere produced by PSG's ultras, and produced a positive result.PSG and Brazil winger Neymar was among the crowd at the Stade Jean Bouin, where the noise was non-stop throughout the game.Cuthbert shines in ParisErin Cuthbert's work-rate in midfield helped to lead Chelsea to victoryVersatile Scotland midfielder Erin Cuthbert was the engine as Chelsea's European campaign got off to a winning start.She provided the expertly timed cross for Bright's opening goal but was integral throughout, producing a high-effort performance to thwart PSG's attempts to go forward.Her endeavours reduced the hosts to trying their luck from distance and nullified the threats they would otherwise have posed on the counter.""I thought she was absolutely immense tonight,"" said Green. ""I thought she was really strong and dominated that area, won tackles and dominated the ball for us. We've nurtured her and know how good Erin is.""Working as part of a double-pivot alongside the equally impressive Sophie Ingle at the base of the Blues' midfield, she helped to steady the play and allow Chelsea to move forward with fluidity.Cuthbert's previous work as a winger was evident in her excellent distribution to follow up a failed corner by expertly finding Bright at the back post.Her efforts in front of the defence aided Bright and Kadeisha Buchanan behind her to produce a steely performance and limit PSG to only a single shot on target.It was a display in marked contrast to their last appearance in the competition - when they were thrashed 4-0 by Wolfsburg last December to go out in the group stages.Green spoke before the game of getting back to basics - and they did just that.Striker Sam Kerr also looked threatening for the Blues and she drew a smart save from Sarah Bouhaddi in the first half, but it was their defensive efforts which enabled them to edge one of Europe's strongest teams.While the display and result bodes well for their chances of progressing, Green said the team ""don't want to get carried away"".He added: ""There are a lot of good teams out there in Europe and they need to be respected. It does give confidence that we can play against a top European team and play like we did.""The Blues have a difficult group with last year's quarter-finalists Real Madrid likely to make it a three-way battle, along with PSG, to qualify. Next up for Chelsea is a home match with Albanian debutants Vllaznia on Wednesday.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63321387

633,Lyon 1-5 Arsenal: Gunners stun Champions League holders with brilliant away performance,WED 19 Oct 2022,womens-champions-league,"Caitlin Foord fired Arsenal in front against reigning champions LyonArsenal laid down a stunning marker for their Women's Champions League campaign by thumping holders Lyon in France.Jonas Eidevall's side comprehensively outplayed the European champions, taking a 2-0 lead with goals from Caitlin Foord and Frida Maanum.Lyon pulled one back through Melvine Malard, however Beth Mead restored the two-goal advantage with a powerful free-kick.Quickfire second-half goals from Foord and Mead completed a brilliant win.The victory gives Arsenal early control of Champions League Group C, while Juventus beat Zurich 2-0 in Wednesday night's other fixture in the pool.Yet it is the nature of the success which will send shockwaves through European women's football.Lyon had never lost by three or more goals in this competition, and had not conceded more than four in a game for 17 years before this home thrashing.Magnificent Arsenal make a huge statementThere are few bigger statements a football team can make than beating the holders and Champions League winners in six of the last seven seasons on their own ground in the opening game of the group stage.Yet that is what Arsenal managed - their first win in six meetings with Lyon - and in truly eye-catching, jaw-dropping style.Not only did they put five goals past a club crowned European champions more times than any other, they did so with their star striker on the bench and first-choice centre-back pairing absent through injury.Vivianne Miedema, with 120 goals in 149 games for Arsenal before tonight, was replaced by Maanum, while the Gunners were still without Rafaelle Souza and Leah Williamson as Steph Catley and Lotte Wubben-Moy commanded their defence.While Catley and Wubben-Moy kept a clean sheet against Reading at the weekend in the Women's Super League, this game was expected to be a bigger test for them. Yet it was at the other end where Arsenal really shone.They deservedly took a 13th-minute lead when a long ball reached Stina Blackstenius, who played a great first-time pass across the box which Foord steered home.Shock Miedema exclusion justifiedFrida Maanum made her first start in the Champions LeagueMaanum then showed why she was selected ahead of Miedema. Good in the final third, she linked up play, continually disrupted Lyon's forward runs and earned her goal.It was a bold tactical call by Eidevall, one which would have seen him questioned had Lyon won, but the Norwegian midfielder repaid her manager's faith.Eidevall introduced Miedema for her 150th Arsenal game in the final 10 minutes for little more than a lap of honour as her team-mates had long since ensured Lyon would suffer just their second loss in 83 home games.They claimed the second goal in the 22nd minute when Blackstenius broke through, but was denied by Lyon goalkeeper Christiane Endler. Maanum, though, was there to collect the rebound and roll it into the net past the covering defenders.It meant Lyon trailed by more than one goal in the Champions League for the first time since April 2009 - and they looked like a side that had been affected by injuries.Ada Hegerberg, Catarina Macario, Dzenifer Marozsan, Sara Dabritz, Ellie Carpenter and Griedge Mbock were all missing, but it was still an impressive squad, with Eugenie Le Sommer, Lindsey Horan and Wendie Renard among the starters.They rarely made that quality tell though, and even their goal was fortunate as Horan deflected Selma Bacha's corner on to the crossbar and Malard tucked in the rebound.Good week for Mead gets even betterBeth Mead has now scored five goals in all competitions for Arsenal this seasonIt was Arsenal's night and, as so often in 2022, it was Mead's game which everyone else was playing in. The Euro 2022 winner and Women's Ballon d'Or runner-up was in scintillating form again, constantly getting the better of Bacha on the wing.She struck her free-kick goal low to the keeper's left, a powerful finish that Endler could not keep out.Blackstenius would have made it 4-1 on the hour mark had her 10-yard shot not struck a team-mate.Instead it was Foord who got her second with the pick of the bunch. Renard badly mishit a clearance under no pressure and Arsenal's Australian international calmly took the ball down and fired a 25-yard curler into the bottom corner.Mead was then played through as Lyon's defence fell apart, leaving a gaping hole for the England international to step through and smash a finish past Endler for her second goal.Lyon's misery was summed up in stoppage-time as Horan headed against the post from a free-kick, before the rebound was thrashed well wide.Last season's Champions League campaign was one to forget for Arsenal as they shipped four goals home and away to Barcelona and Hoffenheim, before being dumped out by Wolfsburg.On the basis of their dazzling display, though, this could be one to remember.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63307954

638,Arsenal 2-2 Ajax: Late Ajax equaliser levels Champions League qualifying tie,TUE 20 Sept 2022,womens-champions-league,"Arsenal were knocked out of the Champions League by Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals last seasonArsenal's hopes of reaching the Women's Champions League group stage are in the balance after a late Ajax equaliser in Tuesday's qualifier first leg.Having fought back from a goal down, Arsenal conceded late on as Netherlands international Romee Leuchter scored a tap-in to level the tie at 2-2.Substitute Katie McCabe then had a winning goal chalked off for offside. Jonas Eidevall's team must win in Amsterdam next week to guarantee a group stage place.A draw would take the qualifier to extra time and potentially a penalty shootout.Leuchter opened the scoring at Meadow Park for Ajax after 17 minutes before a Stina Blackstenius strike levelled the scores just six minutes later.Blackstenius, who also scored in Friday's 4-0 WSL victory against Brighton, scored with a volley after Rafaelle's header rebounded off the crossbar and fell to the Swedish forward.Following a scrappy first half for the home side, Arsenal went ahead after the break when captain Kim Little calmly slotted home from the penalty spot after Beth Mead was fouled by Soraya Verhoeve.Despite having the better chances, the Gunners fell foul to scrappy defending and failed to clear their lines as Leuchter claimed her second goal of the evening seven minutes from full-time.Line-upsLine-upsArsenal WomenFormation  4-2-3-11Zinsberger16Maritz6Williamson2Carvalho Souza7Catley10Little13Wälti9Mead11Miedema17Hurtig25Blackstenius1Zinsberger16Maritz6Williamson2Carvalho Souza7Catley10Little13Wälti9Mead11Miedema17HurtigSubstituted forFoordat 58'minutes25BlacksteniusSubstituted forMcCabeat 75'minutesSubstitutes3Wubben-Moy5Beattie8Nobbs12Maanum15McCabe18Marckese19Foord26Wienroither59Agyemang61Earl62ReidAjax WomenFormation  4-1-4-11Kop2van der Most26Kardinaal4Doorn5Verhoeve8Spitse15Grant10Noordam23Pelova11Weerden7Leuchter1Kop2van der MostBooked at 64mins26Kardinaal4DoornBooked at 69mins5VerhoeveBooked at 55mins8Spitse15GrantSubstituted forBakkerat 90+2'minutes10Noordam23Pelova11WeerdenSubstituted forHoekstraat 62'minutes7LeuchterSubstitutes6Munsterman9Tromp17Kruize18Keijzer19Hoekstra20Bakker21van Gool22Sabajo30Bussman31van der WalReferee:Frida NielsenAttendance:2,550",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62973872
639,Rangers 2-3 Benfica: Scottish side's Champions League group hopes on knife edge,TUE 20 Sept 2022,womens-champions-league,"Women's Champions League: Benfica beat Rangers in five-goal thrillerA controversial late own goal condemned Rangers to a Champions League second-round defeat by Benfica and left their group stage hopes on a knife edge.Two goals from Kayla McCoy looked to have earned the Scottish champions a draw to take to Lisbon.But Benfica snatched victory when goalkeeper Victoria Esson was adjudged to have narrowly carried the ball over her own line after a wicked deflection.Ana Vitoria had equalised, then put Benfica ahead in a thrilling game.As it happenedThe sides will meet again next Wednesday, with Rangers still in the tie despite the late heartbreak.Ibrox has witnessed its fair share of big European nights in the past. For Rangers Women, it was arguably the biggest tie in their history, and their first ever Champions League match on home soil.However they looked nervy early on and Benfica, the Portuguese champions, should have led on 19 minutes when an unmarked Marta Cintra side-footed off the near post with the goal at her mercy.Rangers weathered the storm and struck first when Brogan Hay picked out McCoy, who beat goalkeeper Rute Costa with a downward header at the near post.And as the hosts' nerves began to erode, Jenny Danielsson should have done better than shoot straight at Costa when left alone outside the box.But Rangers were caught napping when, from their own drop ball, Benfica stole possession and Vitoria played a one-two before racing into the box and finishing clinically into the far corner.After the break Benfica again began to show their quality and Vitoria thumped a second goal into the roof of the net in between fine saves from Esson to deny Pauleta twice.Yet, Rangers found an equaliser just two minutes after falling behind when McCoy raced on to Nicola Docherty's long ball and hammered home a left-foot shot.Benfica were undeterred and continued to up the tempo, and eventually found a third in bizarre circumstances when Esson had to scramble back to try and stop Lisa Martinez's attempted clearance going in.Rangers were adamant their goalkeeper had stopped the ball crossing the line, but the assistant referee gave the goal and Benfica saw the game out.It leaves Rangers with it all to do in Portugal and the deficit could have been greater, but Lucia Alves rattled the crossbar late on as she let fly from 25 yards.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62974177
640,Barcelona 1-3 Lyon: Brilliant Lyon win eighth Champions League crown,SAT 21 May 2022,womens-champions-league,"Lyon have reclaimed the title they won five times between 2016 and 2020 and eight times in totalLyon returned to the pinnacle of European football with an eighth Champions League title courtesy of a superb victory over tournament favourites Barcelona in a gripping final in Turin.The French side came into the game as underdogs against a Barca side that had lost just once in a season that included a flawless La Liga-winning campaign.But the most decorated side in the women's game started superbly, pressing high and picking apart the Catalans to charge into a 3-0 first-half lead. Amandine Henry struck a brilliant long-range strike to give them a lead that was doubled by a header from Ada Hegerberg, returning to Europe's biggest stage for the first time since her 20-month injury lay-off.The Norwegian forward then turned provider to set up Catarina Macario for a close-range finish to leave a shell-shocked Barca reeling.Ballon d'Or holder Alexia Putellas gave Barcelona hope just before the break with a low finish - her 33rd goal of the season and 11th of this Champions League campaign.Jonatan Giraldez's side then threw everything they could at Lyon, including an ambitious effort from Patricia Guijarro from close to halfway that hammered the bar, but the French side held firm to reclaim the European crown they last held in 2020.Best action and reaction as Lyon beat Barcelona in the Women's Champions League finalHow Lyon bullied Barcelona to reclaim European crownHegerberg helps Lyon conquer Europe againAda Hegerberg has scored an unmatched 59 goals in 60 Champions League gamesIt was predicted by many before kick-off that Saturday's game would be a symbolic passing of the torch in women's European football, from a Lyon side that dominated during the 2010s to a Barca team that had swept aside nearly all challengers in the past two years, including Chelsea in last year's final.But despite arriving in Turin with a competitive record of 41 wins and just one defeat in 2021-22, Barcelona simply could not match the French side for focus, ferocity and tactical nous in front of 32,257 fans at Juventus' Allianz Arena.Driven on by Champions League record scorer Hegerberg, Sonia Bompastor's side exploited defensive frailty in their opponents, while keeping the Catalan side's prolific attack at bay to seize firm control of the contest.Henry's goal was the pick of the bunch, arrowed into the top corner from 25 yards after she had returned to her feet following a ball-winning tackle. But Hegerberg provided the most regular threat.Had she taken her chances, she could have repeated her feat of scoring a first-half hat-trick the last time these two met in the Champions League final - three years ago when Lyon were 4-1 victors.Instead, Hegerberg settled for the one header - that took her record tally of goals in this tournament to 59 in 60 matches - and an assist for Macario that established too big a gulf to bridge, even for a Barcelona side that had outscored their rivals 159-11 to win their domestic league by 24 points.""It's team work, team work all day long, baby,"" said Hegerberg, who also struck the post with a volley in injury time. ""Incredible team-mates, I'm very proud of them. Winning this one this year wasn't easy.""Resilience, hard work - it's so motivating. I'm only 26 as well, so let's keep this going.""Putellas is considered the current best player in the world and so often an inspiration to this Barca side, but even this was beyond her considerable powers.She did her bit, providing hope with her 41st-minute finish, but beyond that she was well marshalled in midfield.Putellas saw plenty of the ball in a final 15 minutes spent almost exclusively in the Lyon half, but some dogged defending and misses from Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic and Irene Paredes saw the French side over the line.It represented a notable personal triumph for their boss Bompastor, who became the first woman to win the Champions League as a player and manager. The former midfielder, 41, was part of the successful Lyon side in 2011 and 2012.Henry's goal was the pick of those scored in Turin on Saturday eveningThe crowd of 32,257 was the second-best ever for a Champions League final after 2012 - when Lyon triumphed in MunichThe defeat was only Barcelona's second of the season. They can still seal a domestic double, with a Copa de la Reina semi-final against Real Madrid to follow on WednesdayHegerberg (centre) has now won six Champions League titles with Lyon",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61521276
641,Women's Champions League: Barcelona beat Wolfsburg on aggregate to reach final,SAT 30 Apr 2022,womens-champions-league,"Barcelona reached their second successive Champions League finalWomen's Champions League holders Barcelona progressed to this year's final despite defeat in Wolfsburg.Goals from Jill Roord and Tabea Wassmuth handed the German side a 2-0 win, but Barca won the tie 5-3 on aggregate.Barca struggled to to cope with Wolfsburg's intensity but could afford to sit back thanks to their first-leg performance in winning 5-1 at Camp Nou.They will now face either PSG or Lyon in Turin on 21 May.Spirited Wolfsburg performance not enough but exposes BarcaWolfburg's performance, with a well-worked gameplan, showed that Barcelona have weaknesses that can be exploited. Eight days ago, the German side had been continually unpicked by Barca who effortlessly controlled the game in front of a record-breaking crowd of 91,648.This meeting was different with Wolfsburg's intelligent pressing in the middle keeping Barca at bay throughout the match.The performance was all the more impressive given Lena Oberdorf, perhaps the hosts' biggest talent, was absent with a knee sprain.The visitors enjoyed the majority of the early possession, but the best of the first-half chances came for the hosts when Ewa Pajor slipped an excellent pass towards Roord, whose effort was stopped by Sandra Panos in the Spanish goal.The intensity then increased in the second half as Wolfsburg took the game to Barca.And it was an approach that worked, creating the chances which led to Wassmuth opening the scoring from distance before Roord made it two with her own outside-the-box effort soon after.Barca settled down and managed to prevent any further damage but still suffered defeat for the first time this season, a result that will give encouragement to their opponents in the final.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61286545

The second leg will be played in Paris on Saturday.Women's Champions League action as it happenedLyon have won this tournament a record seven times and will go to the Parc des Princes with a one-goal advantage after winning in front of a crowd of 22,774 at the Groupama Stadium.However, they had to come from behind to do so as they fell behind after only six minutes. The hosts failed to clear near the touchline and that enabled Sara Dabritz to pass to Katoto and she showed her pace to sprint clear of Renard and shoot past Christiane Endler.But Lyon were only behind for 17 minutes. Delphine Cascarino passed to Malard and her shot was only parried by Votikova before the Czech Republic international fouled Malard to concede the penalty, which Renard converted on a day when she made her 100th appearance in the competition.Lyon were gifted a second in the 33rd minute as Votikova's clearance fell straight to Ada Hegerberg and she released Macario to score her first.Her second and Lyon's third goal came in farcical circumstances early in the second half. Dudek passed the ball back to Votikova but the goalkeeper miscontrolled the ball, with it rolling towards her own goal before she lost possession to Macario, who had the simple task of scoring from close range.PSG have never won this tournament, but were awarded a penalty after Malard was judged to have handled and Dudek scored to give them hope ahead of the second leg.The winners of this semi-final are likely to face reigning champions Barcelona, who beat Wolfsburg 5-1 in the first leg at the Nou Camp, in front of a world record crowd of 91,648 on Friday.The final will be held at Juventus' Allianz Stadium on 21 May.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61210213

Diani did have the ball in the net for PSG in normal time, but it was disallowed for a foul on Leitzig, who made another smart stop from Marie-Antoinette Katoto moments later.Bayern tired, though, in extra time and, with PSG able to bring on fresh legs, the hosts capitalised when substitute Bachmann found the far corner with a smart finish with eight minutes to go.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60934507

City had several chances throughout the match - Hemp was denied by goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger, Laura Coombs fired inches over the bar, while Caroline Weir and Georgia Stanway had efforts deflected wide. Chelsea's resilience and determination to put bodies on the line was crucial in their victory as Jess Carter's sliding intervention stopped Ellen White from scoring for City in extra time before Kerr's decisive goal.The Blues, who have now won this competition four times under Hayes, celebrated completing the domestic Double in front of a crowd of 49,094 - the highest in Women's FA Cup history.It is their second piece of silverware in seven days and is the perfect send-off for departing trio Ji So-yun, Drew Spence and Jonna Andersson, who have all played their role in Chelsea's success this season.Chelsea 'will go down in history' says boss HayesRelive the Women's FA Cup finalWhy Wembley is fitting stage for Ji exitKerr the difference againChelsea have won two domestic trophies in seven daysIt was a tight encounter at Wembley between two sides who have developed a strong rivalry in the WSL, but until this season had not met in a domestic cup final.Gareth Taylor's side beat Chelsea to silverware in March when they won the League Cup after coming from behind, and they threatened to do the same again. Moments of quality in normal time kept the teams level - Kerr headed in Millie Bright's deep cross for the opener, Hemp cut inside before curling in an equaliser, Cuthbert struck home off the underside of the crossbar, before Raso's smart run in behind made it 2-2 with minutes remaining. But it was a swift counter-attack - and Kerr's unwavering form in front of goal - which proved the difference. Kerr and Jessie Fleming were both through on goal with only Alex Greenwood back for City, and despite the defender's best efforts she could do nothing to stop the shot nestling into the bottom corner.City will be disappointed as they had plenty of chances at Wembley, but Kerr has now scored in Chelsea's past three domestic cup finals and once again will dominate the headlines.Chelsea's players fell to the ground at full-time after a gruelling 120 minutes, while manager Hayes punched the air on the sidelines - the Blues' dominance of English football continues.'We can't stop smiling' - The FA Cup final that had everything'The best FA Cup final I have witnessed' - analysisFormer England goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis on BBC One:Every player was willing to do anything and everything to get their team over the line.Everything that epitomises women's football at this moment in time was on display this afternoon.

Instead, cup holders Chelsea threatened to extend their lead, with Sophie Ingle and Reiten forcing smart saves from goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger, before striker Bethany England fired one over the bar. Both sets of supporters were in fine voice - an indication of the growing rivalry between these sides, who occupy the top two spots in the Women's Super League.It was the fourth meeting between the sides this season, with Arsenal's only victory coming on the WSL's opening day at Emirates Stadium, while Chelsea won last season's delayed FA Cup final at Wembley in December.Manchester City saw off West Ham to progress to the final on Saturday, and so Chelsea will have an opportunity to make amends for their League Cup final defeat by Gareth Taylor's side in March.Fourteen-time FA Cup winners Arsenal have not won the competition since 2016, while Chelsea are aiming to win a third title in five years.Chelsea's depth shines as inconsistent Arsenal punishedRelive Chelsea's win over ArsenalMan City 'set benchmark' in win over West HamBlues clinical when it matteredArsenal 0-2 Chelsea: Emma Hayes praises 'dominant' Chelsea in FA Cup semi-finalBarely anything has separated these two teams this season, with Chelsea leading the WSL by just a point.The last meeting between them, an exhilarating league encounter at Kingsmeadow in February, ended in a goalless draw.This time, the first half was a little cagey with both sides trying to test the nerve of the other.Arsenal had started well - pressing from the front and asking questions of Chelsea with runs in behind. Mead and Stina Blackstenius were not able to pick out Miedema with a few cut-backs and the hosts finished the half without a shot on target, after inviting some pressure from Chelsea towards the end.The Blues came out the blocks fast in the second half, though, and put away their chances when it mattered.That stalled Arsenal's early momentum and Chelsea went on to dominate, going 2-0 up just after the hour mark.Emma Hayes will now seek to guide Chelsea to the completion of a successful FA Cup defence against an in-form Manchester City side in the final on 15 May at Wembley.Arsenal, who have missed out on two domestic trophies this season, will be hoping to regain top spot in the WSL, needing to close that one-point gap with just four games remaining.'This win means nothing for the league' - reactionChelsea manager Emma Hayes, speaking to BBC Two: ""The first 20 minutes, we were horrific. But once we executed the game plan, we stifled them and they struggled. The goal came at the right time and we dominated them.""We got a clean sheet and we limited them to one chance in the first half. Defensively we were solid. That's our foundation.""This win means nothing for the league. We're in the final, at Wembley.

It was an entertaining semi-final in front of a raucous crowd in Dagenham, with plenty of chances for both teams.City could have had several more with White having two headed goals ruled out - the first as Lucy Bronze failed to keep the ball in play, before White was offside when she was picked out by Keira Walsh.The hosts came close through Tameka Yallop and Katerina Svitkova after the break but City hit the crossbar when Hemp teed up substitute Filippa Angeldahl.City will face the winner of Sunday's match between the Women's Super League's top two Arsenal and Chelsea - live on BBC Two from 12:15 BST - in the final at Wembley on 15 May.Relive City's victory over West HamEmma Hayes relishing Arsenal test'Think like a squirrel' - EidevallEmotional goal for City's KellyChloe Kelly scored her first goal since returning from an anterior cruciate ligament injuryIt was an emotional occasion for Kelly, who was starting her first game for City since returning from an anterior cruciate ligament knee injury.Her goal was gifted to her by West Ham defender Gilly Flaherty but it did not take anything away from what it meant to Kelly, who immediately jumped into the air, clenching her fists before being hugged by her team-mates. She was smiling as she jogged back to the halfway line and exchanged words with manager Gareth Taylor. At half-time, she gestured to family in the stands before heading down the tunnel.The stage speaks for itself - an FA Cup semi-final with a place at Wembley up for grabs. But the timing is also notable given it is only three months until England's opening game at the Euros.If Kelly keeps scoring, playing regularly for City and can get near the level of form she showed before her injury, Lionesses' manager Sarina Wiegman could become interested.

So we have lots of options.""While Daly impressed when moved out of defence, Maya le Tissier stood out at right-back on her senior international debut in a defence which has now conceded just twice in their last six games.The Manchester United full-back made a crucial challenge inside the opening two minutes as Emilie Haavi had a shot saved at the near post by Roebuck, and looked at home with the Lionesses to continue a superb few months since her summer move from Brighton.History made despite Roebuck mistakeEllie Roebuck deputised for the benched Mary Earps in MurciaThe 3,000-seater Pinatar Arena in Murcia was not the most auspicious surroundings to end England's year, but nothing should be taken away from a truly historic 12 months for the Lionesses.What looked like a controlled performance and win was lost with 11 minutes remaining however, as  reserve keeper Roebuck, deployed with regular starter Mary Earps on the bench, blotted her copybook with an awful error.She raced out of her goal to clear a long pass but missed the bouncing ball to allow Arsenal midfielder Maanum to race through and slot into an empty net.Wiegman said of Roebuck's mistake after the game: ""It's disappointing. That happens sometimes too, when it is a goalkeeper then it is a goal. It is unfortunate. As a team you have to concede that and have to try and score another goal.""It was a disappointing end to the night for a youthful England side. With Le Tissier and Roebuck given chances, seven of the starting XI were 25 or under. Only Daly was over 30.Ultimately this showing was well below arguably England's most impressive display of 2022, their 8-0 dismantling of Norway at the Euros. The Norwegians are now under the management of ex-Lionesses and Team GB coach Hege Riise and have improved since that embarrassing defeat.They troubled England all night, even without the injured Ada Hegerberg and Barcelona's Caroline Graham Hansen, who announced in August she would take a break from international duty because of cardiac problems.They were set back on 72 minutes when Anja Sonstevold picked up a rare friendly red card after two bookable fouls on Nikita Parris, but were then gifted a draw by Roebuck's mistake.Nevertheless, while this England display never touched the levels seen at the Euros, it provides a satisfactory conclusion to a year of which Lionesses fans could previously only have dreamed.

662,Northern Ireland 1-0 Italy: Sarah McFadden scores famous winner in Belfast,TUE 15 Nov 2022,womens-international-friendlies,"Watch: NI enjoy memorable friendly win over Italians Sarah McFadden scored a famous winner as Northern Ireland rounded out a historic 2022 with a 1-0 win over Italy at Seaview.McFadden poked home in the 63rd minute in front of a sold-out Belfast crowd.Italy, ranked 14th in the world compared to Northern Ireland in 49th, pressed for an equaliser but struggled to break down the home defence.The match was NI's first at home since the Euro 2022 finals - the country's first major women's tournament.The winner came as Northern Ireland put in their best spell of the match on the hour mark. Half-time substitute Joely Andrews forced Italy goalkeeper Laura Giuliani into a fine save and Demi Vance's corner was touched towards goal by Emily Wilson.Giuliani was able to keep the forward's effort out but McFadden reacted quickest to find the bottom corner and set-up a memorable win.Northern Ireland beat Italy - as it happenedBack at the tight Seaview pitch where Northern Ireland produced the majority of their success prior to the Euros, manager Kenny Shiels' side largely contained the Italians but were dangerous on the counter attack, with the pace of Lauren Wade in particular causing the visiting defence issues.Federica Cafferata dragged an early effort wide for Italy and, at the other end, some confident passing ended with a sloppy pass across goal that almost allowed Caragh Hamilton in, but goalkeeper Giuliani managed to get a touch to take the ball away from the lurking winger.The hosts grew into the opening stages and Callaghan's rasping first-time effort was straight down the throat of the Milan keeper.Watch: 'No better feeling'  - McFadden reflects on winning goalItaly struggled to get their flair players on the ball and were restricted to half-chances. Valentina Cernoia saw a powerful effort blocked by Nadene Caldwell, and Barbara Bonansea fired into the arms of the comfortable Jackie Burns.Reading winger Wade was causing problems, and she got there ahead of the onrushing Guiliani but her momentum took her out of play, and Italy's best chance came when the otherwise impressive Rebecca McKenna lost possession in her own half and Manuela Giugliano could only hit the side netting when trying to lift the ball over Burns.Both sides were restricted to long-range efforts in the closing stages of the half, with Chloe McCarron and Caldwell both off target while Cristina Girelli forced Burns into a straightforward save.McFadden stands up as NI hold firmBeating Italy 'a great step forward' for NI - ShielsJuventus striker Giirelli headed off target and Cernoia fired narrowly wide as the Italians started the second-half on the front foot.However, Northern Ireland's best play of the match came on the hour mark when Andrews found Emily Wilson out wide, and the Crusaders forward returned the pass but Andrews' low effort was held by Giuliani.Andrews was involved again as Hamilton showed superb strength and pace to get to the line and her cutback forced Giuliani to make a strong save from the Glentoran midfielder.McFadden grabbed the opener from the resulting corner to spark wild celebrations.The goal changed the atmosphere around Seaview and lifted Northern Ireland. Vance powered forward from left-back to test Giuliani, who was by far the busier of the goalkeepers, but Italy crept back into the game and Giugliano saw an effort deflected over. Burns produced a brilliant, diving save to claw away Beatrice Merlo's header but, in a blow to Northern Ireland, McFadden was forced off with a leg injury and was replaced by Julie Nelson, winning her 130th cap. Seconds later Caitlan McGuinness was millimetres away from scoring her second international goal when she touched the ball past Giuliani but her effort was weak and scrambled off the line.Italy were frustrated and pressed forward, but Northern Ireland held firm as Toni-Leigh Finnegan and McGuinness fired over in the closing stages.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63624261
663,Scotland 2-1 Venezuela: Scots secure win despite Deyna Castellanos finding net from halfway,MON 14 Nov 2022,womens-international-friendlies,"Deyna Castellanos has scored 16 goals in 31 international appearancesScotland survived a wonder goal from Deyna Castellanos to beat Venezuela in their first full international since their World Cup play-off defeat by the Republic of Ireland.Headed goals from Kelly Clark and Claire Emslie gave Pedro Martinez Losa's side a deserved half-time lead.But Castellanos caught out Scotland goalkeeper Jenna Fife with a lob all the way from near the halfway line.Venezuela had the Scots reeling, but they recovered to see out the win.Scotland's fourth victory in six outings sent Venezuela, 27 places below the Scots in 52nd place in the world rankings, to a fifth consecutive defeat.The South Americans on Thursday had lost 3-1 to Panama, who the Scots defeated 2-0 two days later in what had been downgraded to an under-23 international.Reaction & as it happenedOnly Chelsea playmaker Erin Cuthbert was asked to start again in a side showing four changes from last month's loss to the Irish at Hampden as both sides looked to put behind them the disappointment of having missed out on next year's World Cup finals.While the Scots started tentatively in Cadiz, Venezuela looked comfortable on the ball as they belied a side who lost a South American fifth-place play-off to Chile that would have taken them to the inter-continental play-offs.However, as the Scots began to dominate, they looked to have taken the lead when Fiona Brown rose to meet an Emslie cross - but, as the ball trickled over the line as it emerged from a group of bodies, the referee ruled for a foul on Nayluisa Caceres when it looked like the goalkeeper had actually collided with her own defenders.That was one of the few opportunities created despite a wealth of possession until Celtic defender Clark connected with Caroline Weir's corner whipped into the near post after 36 minutes.Scotland extended the lead within another four minutes as Rosengard's Brown jinked inside her marker and found unmarked fellow winger Emslie to head powerfully home from 12 yards.It looked like a routine win was on the cards - until Castellanos showed the class of a player who made the opposite journey to Scotland's Weir this summer, from Real Madrid to Manchester City.Shortly after Gabriela Garcia had her joy cut short by an offside flag, her strike partner spotted Fife drifting to the edge of her penalty box and launched a shot over the goalkeeper's head from just inside Scotland's half.Having looked ragged and rattled, Scotland steadied themselves to threaten again at the other end, but substitute striker Kirsty Hanson's stabbed effort against the outside of a post was the closest they came to making the scoreline more comfortable.Scotland head coach Pedro Martinez Losa: ""We put in two good performances within two days with different players. It is important that we keep the standards no matter who plays and it was very important to give opportunities to some young players.""They sent a message out that we are still alive, we are here, we are still progressing. Apart from the pain we still feel and will feel for a long time, we are willing to put in the work to make sure we don't miss the next opportunity.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63618112
664,International friendly: Wales 1-1 Finland - Penalty cancels out Carrie Jones goal,SAT 12 Nov 2022,womens-international-friendlies,"Carrie Jones, shown here after giving Wales the lead, made her Wales debut as a 15-year oldWales ended their 2022 schedule with a 1-1 draw against Finland in Pinatar.Wales led at half-time thanks to Carrie Jones' 31st-minute tap-in after Jess Fishlock's run into the box caused problems for the Finnish defence. Eveliina Summanen levelled after the break with a cool penalty after Rhiannon Roberts was harshly adjudged to have handled the ball.Wales were never at their best and Finland looked more likely to find a late winner.This was Wales' final game of a calendar year that promised so much with Gemma Grainger's side reaching a first major tournament play-off, but ultimately ended in disappointment with a last-gasp 2-1 defeat in Switzerland in the play-off final.Live as it happened - Wales 1-1 FinlandGrainger made just one change from the side defeated by Switzerland for the friendly at the Pinatar Arena in Spain with defender Lily Woodham replacing Carrie Holland, who withdrew from the squad with injury.The switch allowed Rachel Rowe to play in a more advanced position in a contest Wales were viewing as the first step in their preparation for trying to reach the 2025 European Championships.Finland played in the last Euros and they began the contest strongly, seemingly determined to end a run of seven successive defeats, with Summanen's shot deflected wide.Wales' goal was barely threatened, but Finland were certainly playing the more incisive football with Linda Sallstrom's deflected effort almost bringing them reward on 25 minutes, but goalkeeper Laura O'Sullivan tipped the ball around the post.A failure to make their possession pay was punished fully by Wales on 30 minutes when Jones was able to tap home as Finland failed to deal with Fishlock's cross.Fishlock, Wales' most-capped player, always looked the most assured player in possession on a night on which many of her team-mates were below their best.This friendly contest was played with a good intensity and both Woodham and Emma Koivisto were shown yellow cards before Olga Ahtinen's effort went wide.Grainger took the opportunity to give match minutes to back-up goalkeeper Olivia Clark and within minutes of her introduction Clark had an opportunity to impress after a harsh penalty was awarded against Rhiannon Roberts after the ball struck her hand.However, there was nothing Clark could do to stop Summanen's excellent penalty as the Tottenham midfielder fired the ball into the roof of the net.It was Finland - ranked one place above Wales - who looked the more likely winner with Katarina Kosola's run culminating in a shot just off target before Clark saved from Summanen's header. Wales manager Gemma Grainger:""Overall I am really pleased. There were some signs of how we want to move forward. After the Switzerland game we wanted to be better in certain areas of the pitch and I think we did that tonight.""There were spells - particularly in the first half and then towards the end of the second - when we really put our stamp on the game and we saw some of the best in-possession football against a higher-ranked nation that we have had. ""We get better out of possession game by game and I think we have seen that again tonight.""The penalty was a little bit soft. The arm was in a fairly natural position and when the ball and player are so close, it's difficult to see that go against you.""We made five changes. Tonight was about not only the performance but utilising the depth we had. It was pleasing see how well the players coming on did. Moving forward we want to utilise as many players as possible.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63469305
665,England 4-0 Japan: Jess Park scores on her debut in Lionesses win,FRI 11 Nov 2022,womens-international-friendlies,"Jess Park replaced Georgia Stanway in stoppage time before scoring with her first touchSubstitute Jess Park scored 79 seconds into her England debut to round off a comfortable victory over Japan in a friendly in Spain.Manchester City forward Park, 21, who is on loan at Everton this season, came off the bench and tapped in a fourth goal for England with her first touch in stoppage time.Chloe Kelly had earlier netted her first goal since the Euro 2022 final, while Rachel Daly and Ella Toone also got on the scoresheet.England remain unbeaten under manager Sarina Wiegman, extending their run to 25 matches having conceded just once in their last five games.Relive England's victory over JapanWright spoke to Mead after diversity commentsFA urges more girls' sport access in schoolsThe Lionesses were tested by a technical and creative Japanese side but looked comfortable for large spells.They controlled the majority of possession, despite a late period of pressure from Japan, and had plenty of chances to add to their tally.Manchester United striker Alessia Russo headed Kelly's cross on to the right post early in the first half before Daly put England ahead. Kelly was a threat throughout and her deliveries from the left caused problems for Japan.It was her cross that was not dealt with by the 2011 world champions when Daly followed up in the box to coolly slide in the opener. Aston Villa forward Daly, playing as a full-back under Wiegman, has now scored an impressive eight goals in 10 starts for club and country this season.Manchester City winger Kelly capped off a strong evening when she fired in Beth Mead's cross to make it 2-0 in the second half.Toone, who signed a contract extension with Manchester United this week, dinked it into the far corner for England's third goal after she was teed up by substitute Ebony Salmon.But it was Park who had the greatest impact off the bench, coming on to poke over the line just seconds after her introduction.Speaking to ITV afterwards, she said: ""I'm a bit overwhelmed at the minute, it's absolutely amazing and I'm so honoured to play for my country and score a goal.""I've dreamed of this ever since I was a young girl, now I'm here and it's come true! My head has gone, I'm so happy.""I don't think there are any words to describe it. It's just absolutely unbelievable.""England take on Norway in their next friendly on Tuesday (19:00 GMT kick-off) in Murcia. England make light work of Japan testChloe Kelly has not scored yet for Manchester City this seasonWith eight months to go until the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, this was another test against varied opposition which England made light work of. Japan are often full of creativity but they struggled to get out of their half as England pressed and hurried them. Euro 2022 top scorer Mead almost scored when she won possession on the edge of Japan's box before her shot was pushed wide and Toone was busy, often linking up with club team-mate Russo.It took a bit of time for England to build their rhythm as the slow pitch and windy conditions impacted their usually fluent attacking play.However, when Daly eventually found the opener, England imposed their dominance and Japan rarely tested goalkeeper Mary Earps.""We played a very good game - lots of football,"" manager Wiegman told ITV. ""They played in a shape that we haven't had against us a lot, so it was good to practise that. We're doing good, we're developing.""Wiegman was forced into several changes due to injury as captain Leah Williamson, Barcelona defender Lucy Bronze and forward Lauren Hemp were all absent through injury but England still showed their quality in depth off the bench.Chelsea's Lauren James came on and performed well, while Salmon provided the assist for Toone and Park, with the latter making her mark in front of goal. This was a test England would expect to win and though Japan were disappointing, it was another sign of the advancing direction under Wiegman before the World Cup.

666,England 0-0 Czech Republic: Lucy Bronze earns 100th cap as Lionesses' winning run ends,TUE 11 Oct 2022,womens-international-friendlies,"Lionesses centurion Lucy Bronze threatened on the right as England struggled to break down the Czech RepublicEngland defender Lucy Bronze has said she did not expect to make 100 international appearances ""in a million years"" after reaching the landmark for England in a 0-0 draw against the Czech Republic in Brighton.Bronze earned her century of caps as part of a dominant display by the Lionesses, who hit the post twice via full debutant Lauren James and Lauren Hemp as they failed to find a way past a determined Czech team.""There aren't too many players who can say they've done that,"" said Bronze, calling her caps total ""pretty amazing"".""I've played alongside players like Fara Williams, Jill Scott, Karen Carney, Kelly Smith - these players that hit 100.""I always thought, 'wow that's an amazing achievement'. Never in a million years did I think I'd put my name alongside those kinds of players on the list.""The result in front of an attendance of 21,222 meant that England failed to win for the first time since a 0-0 draw against Spain in the Arnold Cup Clark in February, while the Czech Republic extended their unbeaten run to four matches.Brilliant Bronze brings up her centuryMore than nine years after making her England debut against Japan, Lucy Bronze became the cap centurion she thought she would never be with a typically enterprising display on the right.Always available on the flank, Bronze's perceptive passing, arrowed runs towards the penalty area and confident defensive work were a feature of the first half as England searched for an opener against opponents keen to impress the largest audience many of them had ever played in front of.Simona Necidova raced in to whip the ball away just in time on one occasion when Bronze burst into the box, while an excellent crossfield delivery from Fran Kirby would have set her free beyond her marker had the Barcelona newcomer not lost her footing.Bronze was also assured and accurate in her crossing, with her only moment of concern coming when she was floored by a robust challenge at the touchline before rising to her feet to demand the ball.Reflecting this week, Bronze revealed that she had been told as a 20-year-old to expect her career to last a maximum of seven more years because of four severe knee injuries that had left her unable to run as a teenager.Had a crystal ball given her a glimpse into the future, Bronze would have seen herself as the reigning England Player of the Year on her 28th birthday, as well as an imminent Champions League winner with Lyon, among other trophies.The move Bronze made to Barcelona only seems likely to enhance her determination and keep her standards as high as this dependably brilliant player's standing in the game.""People keep asking me what's next, can I catch up with Jill [Scott, 161 caps] and Fara [Williams, 172 caps] but I think they're miles off.""I just want to keep playing for England as long as possible. I feel good in this team and I'm playing well. A hundred more? Maybe that's too much, but I just keep going.""Remaining an England mainstay for the rest of Wiegman's reign is the least we should expect from Bronze. She has spoken of emulating Brazil legend Formiga by playing until 43 - and on current form and fitness, that seems merely ambitious rather than outlandish.Compact Czechs cause conundrumThe Czech Republic were always going to provide a markedly different proposition to the challenge England faced in their 2-1 win over the USA at Wembley on Friday.Guided by former international Karel Rada, the visitors were unbeaten in three matches and had shared a 3-3 draw at home to Hungary on Friday, including a hat-trick from Sevilla's Andrea Staskova.Tereza Szewieczkova, who started, had scored twice when her side took the lead against England before losing to an 86th-minute goal in 2019, and the visitors immediately subdued the atmosphere by going close.England could not have come any nearer to scoring, hitting the post twice and seeing Olivie Lukasova and her defenders repeatedly thwart their attempts to find the net.Had they scored through that early chance for James, Wiegman believes the match would have become much more open.The England manager acknowledged that she could have picked easier opposition but wanted her players to test themselves against teams who would shut down space and provide significant resistance.""We knew they would drop a little deeper,"" said Wiegman. ""That's what they did and we have to do a little better in those situations. For us, it is a very good learning moment.""I hoped we would have broken down their defence more easily. We tried to do that but we didn't. We have to be better in possession in small spaces.""We can expect opponents in the future who are tight, very physical and drop deeper. We could easily play opponents where we know we're going to win but we have to be uncomfortable, too.""Reaction as England held by Czech Republic in Brighton",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63209760
667,England 2-1 USA: Lionesses beat world champions in Wembley friendly,FRI 07 Oct 2022,womens-international-friendlies,"England's opening goalscorer Lauren Hemp was playing as a number nine in place of the injured Alessia RussoEuropean champions England beat world champions the United States for the first time since 2017 in front of more than 76,000 fans at Wembley Stadium.It promised to be a blockbuster fixture and did not disappoint with VAR drama, goals and a penalty featuring in the showpiece friendly.Manchester City winger Lauren Hemp, filling in as a central striker for the injured Alessia Russo, put the Lionesses ahead after just 10 minutes. The USA responded when Sophia Smith fired in an equaliser, but England were awarded a penalty for a high boot on Lucy Bronze after referee Riem Hussein went to check the VAR monitor.England honour former Lionesses in 50th anniversary celebrations at WembleyReaction to England's victory over USAGeorgia Stanway stepped up to make it 2-1, before the USA had a goal ruled out for a marginal offside minutes later.Chances continued to fall for both sides after the break - the visitors having the best of them - in an open, frantic encounter.There was further frustration for the USA after they were awarded a penalty for handball in the 81st minute, but referee Hussein once again checked the VAR monitor and overturned her decision.England held on to record a huge victory against their long-standing rivals in their first meeting at the national stadium, and extend their impressive unbeaten run to 23 matches under manager Sarina Wiegman.Speaking to ITV Sport after the game, Wiegman said: ""That was really intense, just what we wanted. USA played as we expected, they gave us hard times sometimes. I thought we played well in moments, better first half than second.""This was just the third time England have beaten the USA in 11 meetings - and the first victory since the SheBelieves Cup in March 2017. The teams met in the 2019 Women's World Cup semi-finals when the USA won 2-1.It also comes 10 months before the 2023 Women's World Cup which England are bidding to win for the first time, while the USA are hoping to defend their crown for a third successive tournament. Before kick-off, England showed solidarity with the USA after an inquiry uncovered ""systemic"" abuse and misconduct in the National Women's Soccer League earlier this week.Players wore teal armbands, Wembley's arch was lit in teal and both squads gathered in the middle before kick-off, arm-in-arm in front of a banner saying 'Protect The Players'. England and USA players joined in a show of support over allegations of abuse in the NWSLUSA manager Vlatko Andonovski said after the game: ""Obviously it was an extremely difficult week for everybody. It wasn't easy for them to see and experience everything they went through.""I applaud their bravery and their fearlessness and relentlessness. They showed once again nothing will stop them playing the game they love. I hope we never have to go through that again.""It was a very special moment when the players got together and had the banner in front of them. It gave me goosebumps when the crowd applauded them. It was a statement, and once again the players did an incredible job to use this game and this event as a platform to fight against it.""England lay down marker for World CupThis was one of the Lionesses' biggest tests so far under Wiegman, and though both teams were missing key players, it was a dress rehearsal for what could come at the World Cup next summer in Australia and New Zealand.It was pleasing therefore that the fine margins went England's way in this fixture, when they have suffered so much heartbreak in the past. Beth Mead's curling cross was not dealt with by defender Alana Cook and Hemp was able to poke in from close range for England's opener.The 22-year-old was playing in a less familiar number nine position because of Russo's absence and thrived, causing havoc all match and creating numerous chances.Wiegman said of Hemp's performance: ""She was enjoying herself and giving them a lot of problems. It helps that she scored a goal!""Mead and Chloe Kelly on the opposite wing were also hugely dangerous in an impressive England attack, but Wiegman's side were also given good fortune.USA substitute Hailie Mace was shown a yellow card when her high boot caught Bronze in the face, leading to the penalty which Stanway put away to restore England's narrow lead before half-time.And VAR twice came to England's aid when Trinity Rodman's finish was ruled out after Smith was inches offside in the fluent build-up.It was another warning sign for England, who were cut open on numerous occasions at the back with Rodman, Megan Rapinoe and Smith all having big chances.Asked whether she was happy with her team's defensive display, Wiegman said: ""Sometimes we were very open and we know the USA are very quick, but we wanted to play a game with the high press. We will review and see if we can do better, but this is how we want to play.""England could have extended their lead too - Stanway fired wide and Bronze struck the side-netting - but the USA thought they had been handed a lifeline when referee Hussein blew for handball with less than 10 minutes remaining. Replays showed the ball deflected off the back of Rachel Daly and the decision was overturned, before England held on to pick up a significant victory over the World Cup holders in front of 76,893 supporters at Wembley.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63175129

And Van de Donk passed up another chance after Miedema's header came back off the crossbar, the rebound shot looping over to safety for Scotland.Miedema was then unfortunate to see her shot deflect wide.The second period produced fewer chances, though Miedema forced a good save from Lee Gibson after latching on to the ball in a central position.A fierce drive by Erin Cuthbert after some delightful footwork by Caroline Weir was held by home keeper Daphne van Domselaar, who then blocked Emslie's header after the forward pounced on a loose ball.Weir directed a low shot wide and, at the other end, Scotland had a let-off when substitute Pelova's volley rattled Gibson's left-hand post.But the Dutch pressure told when Jansen's effort took a nick and looped up, Gibson pushing the ball on to the bar only for Kalma to pounce.An unfortunate end for Scotland, who were competitive throughout and gave game time to 17 players in all.Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

670,International friendly: New Zealand 0-0 Wales,TUE 28 Jun 2022,womens-international-friendlies,"Wales had beaten New Zealand 1-0 the last time the sides had met in 2019.Wales warmed up for the climax of their World Cup qualifying campaign with a goalless draw against New Zealand.Natasha Harding went close for Wales before New Zealand's Jacqui Hand hit the bar.The friendly came at the end of a Spanish training camp boss Gemma Grainger hopes will prove ideal preparation for September qualifiers against Greece and Slovenia.Wales need four points from those two games to secure a World Cup play-off.Grainger's side have now won only once in five matches but, while a victory over New Zealand would have been welcome, it is the fixtures which lie ahead that really matter.Grainger can take satisfaction from a solid workout - and a clean sheet - to round off her squad's week-long stay in south east Spain.New Zealand are already assured of a place at the 2023 World Cup as they are co-hosting the tournament with Australia.The Football Ferns are ranked 22nd in the world by Fifa - nine places above Wales - yet their form has been poor since these two nations last met, in a Cardiff friendly in 2019.Kayleigh Green scored a late winner that day, and the Brighton striker led the Welsh line once more as Grainger picked her strongest available team. Only Jess Fishlock, who did not travel to Spain because of her hectic club schedule, was missing from the side which started Wales' last game, the 3-0 qualifying win in Kazakhstan in April.Yet Grainger's players have had little football of late, so perhaps it was not a surprise that they lacked fluency in a game which was scrappy at times.Wales' best opportunities came in the first half, when they threatened for a while to seize control of the contest as Angharad James - winning her 98th cap - and Sophie Ingle took charge in midfield.Their first threat came when Rachel Rowe burst into space down the New Zealand right, but her low cross was just too strong for Ceri Holland to tap home.Ingle's threaded pass then sent Harding in behind the Kiwi defence, but the former Reading forward's shot deflected narrowly wide of the far post. Orlando Pride midfielder Angharad James believes Gareth Bale will excel in the USAJames and Green both lifted efforts over the bar before New Zealand's Elizabeth Anton took aim from distance and Wales keeper Laura O'Sullivan pushed the ball over the bar.Wales were opened up from the short corner which followed, and were relieved to see the unmarked Meikayla Moore head wide from Katie Bowen's cross. It was New Zealand who had the first chance of the second half, when another corner ended with captain Katherine Stott driving a shot over the bar.Grainger turned to her substitutes - as planned - and Ffion Morgan's first contribution was a sharp break and cross which the stretching Green volleyed over the top. New Zealand improved as Wales faded in the heat, and there was a scare when O'Sullivan could only punch a cross as far as Olivia Chance, but her goalbound effort was hacked clear by Rhiannon Roberts.  But O'Sullivan was on hand to save Wales a minute from time, the Cardiff City goalkeeper leaping to her right to push Hand's header on to the bar. Wales manager Gemma Grainger told BBC Sport Wales:""We will take so many positives. My instant reflection is around the changes we made and the impact they had. To play higher-ranked opposition, and the mentality we have when we do that, we are making huge improvements.""To come here [to Spain] and learn what we have on and off the pitch, we have definitely achieved our goals. We will reflect on that and put it into September's preparations.""We are at the right place for us. The players go back to their clubs, continue with their pre-season and take care of themselves with the focus on coming back here in September.""For me it will [now] be about making sure I connect with individual players and building relationships with clubs to make sure we get the best out of them, and obviously making sure we are prepared for the opposition.""

671,England 5-1 Netherlands: Lionesses impress as they come from behind to beat Dutch,FRI 24 Jun 2022,womens-international-friendlies,"Beth Mead scored a minute after the Netherlands missed a penaltyEngland came from behind for the first time under manager Sarina Wiegman to register an impressive victory over European champions the Netherlands.Substitutes Beth Mead and Ella Toone made an impact as they both got on the scoresheet in a one-sided second half.The Dutch led through Lieke Martens' header before Lucy Bronze equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time.Mead then struck moments after Dutch captain Sherida Spitse hit the post from the penalty spot, before Toone and Lauren Hemp doubled England's tally in the space of two minutes.Arsenal winger Mead added a fifth goal late on to confirm a resounding victory in a statement performance from the Lionesses in Leeds.England's victory, played in front of a vibrant crowd at Elland Road, extended their unbeaten run under manager Wiegman after she joined from the Netherlands in September.They have just one friendly remaining - against Switzerland on 30 June - before opening the home Euros at Old Trafford against Austria on 6 July. It was an entertaining match throughout as England were pressed intensely by the visitors in the first half and found themselves trailing when Martens' well-timed header caught out Mary Earps on a corner.Bronze then looped a cross - intended for Beth England - inside the far post to ensure the teams were level at the break.The Netherlands were awarded a penalty following a VAR review when Alex Greenwood brought down ex-Arsenal midfielder Danielle van de Donk but Spitse, making her 200th appearance, struck the post.Within seconds, England went up the other end and Hemp curled it into the path for substitute Mead to direct home.The crowd were on their feet and momentum was with England as they pushed to extend their advantage - Toone eventually curling in a third, before Hemp pounced on a rebound off the post to fire in a fourth.It was a taste of the exciting football England are capable of producing at the Euros and the supporters who chanted ""we want five"" after Hemp's goal were given what they asked for when Mead fired in another in the dying moments.Those leaving Elland Road will no doubt have come away feeling even more anticipation for the first game which is just 12 days away.England send message to Euros rivalsEngland deliver against 'biggest test'Wiegman, who led the Netherlands to the European title on home soil in 2017, said they would be England's biggest test in their friendlies before the tournament.They proved to be hard to contain in the first half as Lineth Beerensteyn came close on two occasions and Martens was dangerous on the left. But England bounced back well after Martens had given the visitors a 22nd-minute lead and went up another gear in the second half.Wiegman admitted the missed penalty proved a gamechanger, with England taking the lead just a minute later.""We were struggling in the first half; the Netherlands were playing well,"" she said. ""They got the penalty and didn't score, within a minute we scored, and then we sped up the levels of the game. The Netherlands had trouble with that and then we just kept scoring.""Scoring within a minute was a gamechanger. We also showed against Belgium that this team has depth; we can make substitutions and get the game to the next level.""Toone and Mead were explosive and dynamic when they came on, striker Alessia Russo was constantly on the move inside the penalty area and Hemp's deliveries from the left were pin-point.There was a party atmosphere at full-time as 19,365 fans celebrated with a rendition of 'Sweet Caroline', the waving flags and scarves a taste of what could come this summer.Toone shines as selection headache emergesElla Toone scored 10 minutes after coming on as a substitute at Elland RoadWiegman still has some decisions to make over her team selection as the Euros draws nearer and the performances of Toone, Mead, Chloe Kelly and Fran Kirby have produced even more headaches. Kirby was given the nod in midfield - with Wiegman opting for Georgia Stanway in the 3-0 win over Belgium - and the Chelsea star was bright and creative.She linked up well with Kelly in particular in the first half but Wiegman's decision will not be easy as Kirby's replacement, Toone, stole the show in the second half.The Manchester United youngster, who had appeared in every game under Wiegman prior to this month's friendlies, got on the scoresheet and it was her shot which struck the post leading to Hemp's goal.On Toone and Mead's impact off the bench, Wiegman said: ""They very energetic and you could tell they were having fun on the pitch. That comes into the rest of the team.""With both Toone and Kirby providing strong options, Wiegman admitted the midfield places were still up for grabs.""Yeah that is, absolutely [a decision still]. We have so much quality. We were trying things out. We have one more game to try things out then we will be ready to go,"" said Wiegman.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61904229

It was the visitors who started the brighter side under the setting Lier sun as Kirsty McGuinness' ambitious effort was pushed away by Nicky Evrard in the home goal.However, the Red Flames grew into the half and Wullaert's effort bounced off the outside of the post after Sarah McFadden's swing and miss failed to connect with the ball, however the Belgian captain made no mistake with her next opportunity.Tine de Caigny cut open the Northern Ireland defence with a clinical pass between Julie Nelson and Abbie Magee, which allowed Davina Philtjens to find the unmarked Wullaert and the forward made no mistake for her 66th international goal. Northern Ireland pushed for an immediate response with two corners that were dealt with by Evrard, however they had a let-off at the other end when Nelson's half clearance fell to Hannah Eurlings but the forward could only fire over from the edge of the area.McGuinness had another snap shot from the edge of the area, but Northern Ireland got the goal they deserved when Wade stepped up with a superb effort on the stroke of half-time.Winger McGuinness flicked the ball across the edge of the area and Wade reacted quickest and launched a first-time effort into the top corner beyond the diving Evrard, sending Northern Ireland in level at the break.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61918023

England will not expect to have as many opportunities against teams such as Norway, who are in their group at the Euros, so will need to show more ruthlessness.They were not short of creativity, though - Stanway looked dangerous when carrying the ball from midfield, Beth Mead linked up well with both Lucy Bronze and Williamson on the right, while Hemp was unpredictable on the left.While those chances are still being created, Wiegman will feel confident in England's ability to eventually get the job done. Kelly's introduction was a pleasing sign too - she has looked sharp since her return for Manchester City at the end of the season just completed, and if she is closer to full fitness by the time the tournament comes around, she will be a significant threat.'Wiegman is a perfectionist' - reaction England winger Chloe Kelly to ITV: ""It couldn't [have gone better]. It was brilliant to be back out there.""I said from the start I wanted to be at the Euros. I worked hard each day.""Sarina [Wiegman] told me to be an attacking player, to get balls in the box and enjoy myself. I tried to get my player one v one and enjoyed every minute of being out there.""Former England defender Anita Asante on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It has been a good test. England had to work hard to break Belgium down and the substitutes had to make the impact.""You see the cohesiveness in the side. It is great momentum going into the next two friendlies before going into the Euros. Sarina Wiegman will be impressed with the display and a positive performance; now it is about tweaking the fine details.""Ex-England defender Laura Bassett on BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The Lionesses would have put pressure on themselves to win because they are expected to win. Did we see entries into the box? Yes. Did we see shots on goal? Yes. Did we see bits that need refining? Yes. There are a lot more positives than negatives. ""The clean sheet was huge and England got tested in possession. They will be tested in other ways against the Netherlands. Sarina Wiegman is a perfectionist and will be asking if we can get to the next level.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61820674

With a penalty shootout looming, Humm's delicate near-post finish meant a painful conclusion to a fine campaign for Wales.Victory would have put Gemma Grainger's side within sight of the 2023 World Cup, but instead they are left licking their wounds after a valiant rearguard effort counted for nothing.Grainger will point to the progress made during her first qualifying campaign as manager, with Wales finishing second in Group I to runaway winners France before beating Bosnia-Herzgovina in last week's play-off semi-final.'Gutted' Ingle proud of entire teamBut Switzerland were the better side in the play-off final and, while the timing of Humm's winner was difficult to take, Wales could not complain about their defeat.Switzerland justified their pre-match billing as favourites against a Wales side who are ranked 30th in the world by Fifa, nine places below their hosts, though Nils Nielsen's team were made to work for their victory. The Swiss went to last summer's European Championship - their third major tournament in the last seven years - whereas Wales have never previously made it as far as the play-off stage of qualification.Wales eventually got the better of Bosnia-Herzegovina courtesy of Jess Fishlock's extra-time goal, and there was no surprise as Grainger named an unchanged team.They had to cope with early pressure in Zurich, with Switzerland asking questions of a Welsh defence which had last been breached by France in April.Rhiannon Roberts (centre) celebrates after scoring just her second goal for WalesThere was a scare when a half-cleared set-piece dropped to Viola Calligaris 25 yards from goal, and her skidding drive kissed the outside of Laura O'Sullivan's post.Wales gradually grew into the contest - and snatched the lead through their first opportunity of any note.Angharad James' corner was not dealt with by the Swiss defence, giving Kayleigh Green the chance to head the ball into Roberts' path.The Liverpool full-back's task was simple, as she rolled the ball beyond a helpless Gaelle Thalmann.Wales were in dreamland, their pockets of fans at Stadion Letzigrund sensing something special was on the cards as Grainger's team defended their lead with relative comfort for a while.Yet the mood changed just before the break, when Lia Walti spotted a gap in the Welsh rearguard and rolled a perfect pass down the right flank for her Arsenal team-mate Noelle Maritz.Her pull-back picked out Bachmann, whose crisp shot flashed past O'Sullivan and into the net.Switzerland carried momentum into the second half, and thought they were ahead after a penalty was awarded against Rachel Rowe for handball.Rowe appeared to have dealt with Eseosa Aigbogun's cross only for Swedish referee Tess Olofsson to give the spot-kick after a lengthy look at the VAR monitor.Barcelona's Crnogorcevic fired the penalty against the base of the post before sweeping in the rebound.But Swiss celebrations were halted by Olofsson, who rightly ruled the goal out because no other player had touched the ball between Crnogorcevic's two efforts.Switzerland celebrate after former Chelsea player Ramona Bachmann's equaliserWales were off the hook.The visitors carved a rare chance as Fishlock found Green in the area but her effort looped over.Then, six minutes from the end of normal time, came the second major intervention from Dutch VAR Jochem Kamphuis. Bachmann thought she had scored her second as she turned sharply in the area and found the far corner - but the goal was eventually ruled out for a marginal offside in the lead-up against substitute Riola Xhemaili.For a moment Wales looked beaten, yet they wriggled off the hook for a second time.Having dug deep to force extra time, Wales had to delve further into the reserves as Switzerland dominated the additional period. Bachmann danced round a couple of challenges only to shoot too close to O'Sullivan, before Crnogorcevic headed narrowly wide and Rachel Rinast volleyed the wrong side of the post.Xhemaili then came close to finding a winner only for her header to be headed off the line by Rachel Rowe.With that an epic contest seemed sure to be decided by a shootout, but Switzerland carved one final opportunity.Geraldine Reuteler made ground down the left and crossed for substitute Humm to deliver the game's decisive blow.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63191596

In a close contest, Fishlock's presence ultimately proved the difference.Fishlock and Holland combined beautifully on five minutes as Wales should have taken the lead, with a freekick routine straight from the training ground culminating in Holland crossing for Fishlock, but her shot from six-yards out was straight at goalkeeper Almina Hodzic.Hodzic denied Wales again on 10 minutes, when Holland found space inside the penalty area following Kayleigh Green's cross, but her header was straight at the goalkeeper.Wales also had the ball in the net on 15 minutes, but the video assistant referee was not needed to show that Green was clearly offside as she gathered the ball after Fishlock's tricky run.Wales have never previously gone so far in World Cup qualifyingHowever, Wales did also need to rely on goalkeeper Laura O'Sullivan in a frantic opening 20 minutes as she saved expertly with an outstretched leg after Marija Aleksic found herself completely unmarked at a corner. This was as close as the visitors would come to scoring.The best efforts were coming from the hosts and after Hodzic could only parry Rachel Rowe's long-range effort the goalkeeper did superbly to tip Holland's rebound onto the crossbar.Holland looked the most likely player to break the deadlock and Hodzic did well to save her low effort after Green's neat flick sent her clear.Wales' best chance of the first-half came and went on 42 minutes when Angharad James volleyed over after Fishlock's inviting cross, with Bosnia-Herzegovina coach Samira Huren no doubt happy to have reached the interval level.Bosnia-Herzegovina began the second half far more competitively and threatened when Hayley Ladd's header almost caught out O'Sullivan, but Ladd was able to clear the danger herself.As it happened & reaction: Wales 1-0 Bosnia-HerzegovinaWales thought they had their breakthrough on 64 minutes, but an offside flag once again denied Green after Fishlock's through ball.The tension of the night grew with every minute that passed without a goal, with both sides terrified that one mistake would undo the efforts of 10 qualification games.Women's World Cup qualifiers: How they workRhiannon Roberts' fine cross on 77 minutes just needed a touch with Fishlock millimetres away, before substitute Ffion Morgan saw an 84th-minute effort ruled out for a contentious offside decision by VAR, with Roberts adjudged to have been interfering with play, despite not touching the ball.Incredibly, Wales found the net for the fourth time just a minute later, but Fishlock was offside.Those disallowed goals meant an extra 30 minutes of football, with Holland seeing a shot deflected agonisingly wide two minutes after the restart.Extra time was essentially attack versus defence with Wales desperate to avoid a penalty shoot-out, especially with goalkeeper Hodzic performing so impressively.However, Wales' magic moment arrived in stoppage time at the end of the first-half of extra time as Fishlock's fabulous volley from Rowe's pinpoint freekick left Hodzic stranded.All the visitors' efforts had been on taking the contest to penalties and Wales were able to see out the contest comfortably as their World Cup dream continues.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63119766

The Bristol City forward met it around six yards out, leaving the net bulging and Hampden's main stand a swaying sea of soggy limbs and flags.From there, the Scots took control.

Denise O'Sullivan's well-taken 37th-minute strike proved decisive as the Irish backed up Thursday's victory over Finland in Dublin with another important win.The Republic can now look forward to a one-legged second round play-off match on 11 October.With Belgium, Serbia and Austria having dropped points over the weekend, the Republic went into Tuesday's game in Senec knowing that a win would seal their place in the second stage as one of the three best second-place finishers of the nine that reached the play-offs.And while they were often frustrated by a physical Slovakian outfit, O'Sullivan's fifth goal of the qualifying campaign ensured Vera Pauw's side edged closer to reaching next summer's finals in Australia and New Zealand. With Slovakia offering little attacking threat, the Republic enjoyed large spells in possession but struggled to create chances during a scrappy opening 30 minutes. Republic skipper Katie McCabe saw her looping volley dip over the bar in the second halfDiane Caldwell had the visitors' first clear opening after 33 minutes when she fired wide after Louise Quinn's knocked down header from a corner. But the Republic only needed to wait another four minutes for the all-important goal as O'Sullivan confidently swept Heather Payne's cross into the Slovakian net, sparking jubilant scenes among the players in orange. After the break, the Republic chased a second as they looked to put the game beyond their hosts, but it proved elusive as Katie McCabe sent a looping volley just over the bar before Claire O'Riordan saw an effort cleared off the line. While Slovakia caused the Republic problems when the sides drew 1-1 last November, the hosts failed to put the Irish defence under sufficient pressure as Pauw's side comfortably held on to boost their chances of progressing through the convoluted play-off system.

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue‘.Accept and continueScotland prepared for the 2023 Women's World Cup play-off draw with a six-goal thrashing of the Faroe Islands in their final qualifier.Nicola Docherty curled in the opener before strikes from Caroline Weir, Erin Cuthbert and Martha Thomas - all in the space of six first-half minutes - sent the Scots into the break four up.Rachel Corsie and Jen Beattie both nodded in to add a fifth and sixth for Pedro Martinez Losa's side, who had already booked a spot in Friday's play-off draw.Despite finishing second in Group B, Scotland will be among the unseeded nations, meaning they will have to navigate two one-off ties to qualify for the finals in Australia and New Zealand.They will face one of Austria, Belgium, Portugal, Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Switzerland, Iceland and Ireland awaiting in the second stage.The two winners in that round with the highest ranking will qualify, with the third play-off winner competing in the inter-confederation play-offs.First-half burst leaves Scots in controlAfter a period of sustained pressure, Rangers left-back Docherty saw the net ripple when her curling effort from the edge of the area nestled in the bottom-right corner.Cuthbert then provided for Real Madrid midfielder Weir, who doubled the advantage after creating room for herself before drilling in a second from 20 yards, before Weir assisted for Chelsea's Cuthbert to lash in a stunning long-range effort.And it was four before the interval when the dangerous Claire Emslie put in a low cross for Thomas to finish at the near post via a slight deflection.It was more of the same after the break when Emslie again created havoc by crossing for captain Corsie to glance in a fifth.Corsie's centre-back partner Beattie then got in on the act by nodding in at the back post, capping off a convincing night's work which acts as perfect preparation for October's play-offs.Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

681,Women's World Cup qualifiers: Three own goals help NI past Latvia in final match,TUE 06 Sept 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Watch: Latvia score three own goals in NI defeatLatvia scored three own goals as Northern Ireland beat the minnows 3-1 in their low-key final World Cup qualifier in Jurmala.The Latvians, ranked 122nd in the world, took the lead against the run of play when Anastasija Rocane's powered a header home to capitalise on Demi Vance's mistimed jump on 27 minutes.Vance redeemed herself with a crucial role in Northern Ireland's equaliser 10 minutes later when her dangerous corner was spilled in to her own net by home goalkeeper Enija-Anna Vaivode.Marissa Callaghan struck the crossbar as Kenny Shiels' side pressed for a winner, which came when Arta Luize Lubina touched the ball beyond the Latvian line with two minutes to play before Vaivode's second own goal, which came after Caragh Hamilton's effort hit the post, sealed NI's win.Northern Ireland could not progress to the World Cup finals and were locked into a third-place finish behind Euro 2022 winners England and Austria, however the win secured a record points tally of 19 in a qualification campaign.The match was Northern Ireland's final competitive outing for 12 months until the start of Euro 2025 qualifying and Shiels' side will have to count on friendlies to maintain the momentum built during a maiden appearance at a major tournament at Euro 2022 this summer.As it happened: Northern Ireland end campaign with Latvia winIt was a similar performance to Friday's penultimate qualifier in Luxembourg, where Northern Ireland dominated against a lower-ranked nation but struggled to turn their possession into goals.However, unlike in Friday's game NI were punished when Rocane capitalised on Vance's mistimed jump to give the hosts a surprise lead from a corner.There was an element of fortune about the equaliser as Vaivode inexplicably pushed the ball in to her own net from a corner.Latvia, with one win from nine matches, appeared determined not to surrender their lead despite the visitors' pressing, with Marissa Callaghan hit the crossbar in NI's best chance before the crucial second goal came in the 89th minute when Sarah McFadden went to challenge Vaivode from a corner and the unsighted goalkeeper pushed the ball in to the net off the unfortunate Lubina.The three points were wrapped up in the final play of the match when Hamilton charged onto Kirsty McGuinness' ball across goal.Hamilton's effort came back off the post and struck Vaivode before nestling in the net to complete an unfortunate hat-trick of own goals by the Latvians.Lacklustre NI almost punished by LatviaNorthern Ireland, who beat the Latvians 4-0 at Windsor Park last September, almost took the lead in the early stages when Emily Wilson found Caitlin McGuinness in the area, and the teenage striker did well to bring the ball down but could only fire over on the turn.Rebecca McKenna's outstretched foot denied Karlina Miksone the opener before Hamilton, debutant Ellie Mason and Toni-Leigh Finnegan all spurned half-chances.The NI pressure kept coming as McKenna's effort was blocked by Rocane, however the Latvians, who lost 20-0 to Euro 2022 champions England earlier in the qualifiers, almost took the lead when Nelle Treimane's effort was pushed over by Jackie Burns and the deadlock was broken on 27 minutes when Rocane headed home.It was a goal against the run of play but the Latvian's hard work was cancelled out by Vaivode's own goal as the goalkeeper spilled Vance's corner into her own net on 37 minutes.The goal settled Northern Ireland down but the visitors had Burns to thank for going in level at the break after the Reading goalkeeper pulled off a smart save to deny Olga Sevcova after the striker had broken the offside trap. Anastasija Rocane put Latvia, ranked 122nd in the world, into the leadMarissa Callaghan was unfortunate not to complete the turnaround just shy of the hour mark when her delightful clipped effort came back off the crossbar, and the captain was inches away from getting a touch on Hamilton's delivery moments later.It was a flat second-half showing and Latvia defended well to smother any Northern Ireland attacks. Kirsty McGuinness saw an effort well blocked and fellow substitute Rebecca Holloway fired over from the resulting corner.However, Lubina's own goal spared any NI blushes and McGuinness saw a powerful close-range effort blocked by the defender as the visitors pressed for a third.Burns stopped Latvia securing a famous draw when she leapt to claw away Viktorija Zaicikova's glancing effort and Vaivode's second own put the game beyond doubt in the closing seconds.The Irish FA said on Saturday that the squad will have a training campaign in either late October or early November which is likely to include a friendly game, with another spring camp also planned.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62795266
682,England 10-0 Luxembourg: Lionesses celebrate homecoming with easy victory,TUE 06 Sept 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Euro 2022 Golden Boot winner Beth Mead contributed to three goalsEngland celebrated their homecoming as European champions in style with a ruthless victory over Luxembourg to end World Cup qualification with a perfect record.With a place at next year's World Cup already in the bag, England were just looking to entertain against a side ranked 117th in the world.Eight players got on the scoresheet as the Lionesses dominated their final qualifier in Stoke and fans welcomed home this summer's heroes.Euro 2022 Golden Boot winner Beth Mead scored one and assisted two, with Manchester United's Ella Toone doing the same.Georgia Stanway and Bethany England each grabbed a double and Rachel Daly, Lauren Hemp, Alessia Russo and Nikita Parris completed the scoring.""I don't think it could be much better than this, so really happy,"" said manager Sarina Wiegman. ""After the Euros it always seems to be a hard one, but I think the team has done a tremendous job coming out of the summer. ""We played two games like this and we knew tonight we were so much better but we had to keep the tempo in the game and I think that's what we did in most parts of the game.""We knew we would win the game so we wanted to try some things out and some players.""England finished eight points ahead of nearest rivals Austria in Group DReaction to England's win over LuxembourgIt was a carnival occasion as supporters paraded new merchandise with the words ""European champions"" on, while recently retired midfielder Jill Scott showed off the Euro trophy before kick-off.But Wiegman, who was presented with her Uefa Coach of the Year award on the night, still expected a professional performance and named a strong side. Jill Scott watched the game in Stoke next to Keira Walsh's familyEngland were creative and purposeful, despite not quite hitting top gear, and they grew into the game as Wiegman made changes.This was never expected to be a test for England but their winning momentum continued and they are still yet to lose a match under the Dutchwoman, while scoring 80 goals and conceding none in World Cup qualifying.Their next contest will be one of their biggest yet, as they face world champions the United States at Wembley on 7 October, just nine months away from the World Cup. That will be followed by a friendly against the Czech Republic in Brighton four days later.""What we will take from those two matches is to develop our style of play,"" added Wiegman. ""Everything we do now is to go ahead to prepare for the World Cup.""Sarina Wiegman was presented with the Uefa Coach of the Year trophy before kick-offEngland finish with 100% record As well as this being an opportunity for fans to celebrate the success of the Euros, it was also one for the England players to impress with the World Cup in their minds.Wiegman's intentions were also clear - there were no surprise selections and she appeared keen to build on the confidence gathered at the Euros, as well as round off qualifying with a 100% record intact.Her team delivered the entertainment as fans chanted ""we want 10"" quickly before Chelsea striker England obliged.Parris, who struggled for form at Arsenal last season before moving to Manchester United in the summer, was given the full 90 minutes in attack and made her mark.She was energetic and heavily involved in the first half but could not find the cutting edge until her goal finally arrived after the break when she coolly slotted into the far corner.It makes it two goals in as many games for Parris, while Mead continued where she left off at the Euros, contributing to three goals in Stoke. It was perhaps a frustrating night for Russo, though, who missed several clear-cut chances in the first half but still added to her tally with a goal in the 17th minute.Expectations on Russo will increase in the coming months as she looks to cement her role as Ellen White's replacement at number nine.Overall, it was a solid performance against a weak side, but England will need to be a little sharper when they take on the USA after the Women's Super League season gets back under way.

683,Women's World Cup: Wales reach play-offs for first time in 0-0 draw with Slovenia,TUE 06 Sept 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Highlights: Wales 0-0 Slovenia - hosts reach World Cup play-offsWales held firm to reach the World Cup play-offs for the first time thanks to a 0-0 draw against Slovenia on a nerve-shredding night in Cardiff.Teenager Carrie Jones came closest for Wales with several fine efforts, while home goalkeeper Laura O'Sullivan had to be alert to deny Mateja Zver.Wales knew a point was enough to see them finish second and they kept their defensive discipline throughout.They might even have won it, but Gemma Evans' header was superbly saved.This was a night on which Wales knew they had history in their grasp, having never before been within a point of qualifying for the play-offs.It was already a celebratory night in the Welsh capital with the crowd of 12,741 more than doubling Wales' record attendance of 5,445.Perhaps even more significantly, Wales' first home game of the campaign was watched by just 1,700 supporters, with the atmosphere - enhanced by Wales' fans' brass band - as loud as it has been for a Wales women's match.Wales boss Gemma Grainger opted to field the same side that won in Greece on Friday, albeit in a less than convincing manner than some of their previous performances in the campaign.That meant their most-capped player, Jess Fishlock, who picked up an injury on camp, was left on the bench in a 'break glass in case of emergency' scenario, as talented teen Jones kept her place following her goal in Volos.The unchanged line-up meant all 10 of Wales' outfield players were Women's Super League players, a blessing and a curse considering the top flight does not get under way until the weekend.Wales' players looked in pre-season mode in Greece, lacking the fluency they have shown throughout this campaign and that continued to be the case in an extremely tense first-half at the Cardiff City Stadium.Indeed, the visitors created more opportunities with captain Zver extremely influential as she gave defender Rhiannon Roberts a tough test on the night she celebrated her 50th Wales appearance.It was Zver who had the first effort on goal after an uncharacteristic mistake from Rachel Rowe, but the Slovenian shot straight at O'Sullivan in the Wales goal after a driving run.Wales' first effort came on 24 minutes when Jones found some space on the left, but Zala Mersnik saved as she cut inside.Zver again gave Wales a worry on 27 minutes when her fiercely struck shot hit the roof of the netting, before Lara Prasnikar lashed over the crossbar when more composure was required.Slovenia simply had to keep on pressing and that opened spaces for Wales, with Ceri Holland stabbing wide after Kayleigh's Green cross.Wales v Slovenia - as it happened & reactionBBC to show five more years of Wales womenGreen then came close to giving Wales the goal they craved, but her outstretched foot just failed to make contact with Jones' volley back across goal after Roberts' cross.Wales began the second period with more purpose and Angharad James tested Marsnik as she sought to celebrate her 100th cap with a goal, before she turned provider, but Jones fired over from distance.Jones was the fulcrum for Wales and felt aggrieved not to be awarded a penalty when Dominika Conc seemed to foul her right on the edge of the penalty area, before she tested Mersnik with a dipping, swerving effort that the Slovenia keeper did well to tip around the post.However, at the other end the threat never went away for Wales with the scores deadlocked and O'Sullivan saved when Kaja Korosec struck from distance.O'Sullivan could do nothing, however, other than hope, when Zver curled the ball just wide on 73 minutes.This was a special night for Wales, but particular plaudits should go to O'Sullivan, the only amateur player in Wales' starting XI, who conceded only five goals in 10 qualifiers and saved her best two performances for clean sheets in Wales' final qualifiers.A huge chance for Wales to lift the tension came and went on 70 minutes when Gemma Evans rose unmarked from James' corner, but Mersnik showed incredible reflexes to repel her header.However, Wales held firm and will now look forward to the play-offs with their World Cup dream still very much alive.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62764159
684,Austria 0-2 England: Alessia Russo and Nikita Parris send Lionesses to World Cup,SAT 03 Sept 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Alessia Russo has scored four goals for England during this World Cup qualifying campaignSarina Wiegman said she was ""proud"" of her England team for booking their place at the 2023 Women's World Cup with one game to spare after defeating Austria in their first match since winning Euro 2022.Alessia Russo - starting in place of Ellen White, who announced her retirement after Euro 2022 - set the Lionesses on their way with an instinctive finish before substitute Nikita Parris wrapped up victory with a fierce strike from inside the box.""I'm very happy we have qualified,"" said Wiegman. ""I think again it was a hard game but coming out of Euros and not having that much rest, I am very proud of the team. It looked so easy but it was pretty hard.""Asked about England being one of the favourites at the World Cup, Wiegman added: ""We knew that was going to be the case.""But we are just trying to do the things that we have to do.""England, who gave a debut to Lauren James as a late substitute, only needed a point to make sure of a place at next year's tournament in Australia and New Zealand.Austria were lively and caused problems, with Mary Earps producing a fine stop to deny Laura Feiersinger from equalising in the second half before Parris made it 2-0. But England's small travelling fanbase marked the final whistle by singing ""We're all off to Australia"" as the Lionesses got the job done before their final game of the qualifying campaign against Luxembourg in Stoke on Tuesday (19:30 BST).Relive the action and reaction as England qualify for the 2023 World CupNikita Parris scored England's 70th goal in this World Cup qualifying campaignEngland can start planning for next summerThe last time the Lionesses were in action, on 31 July, there were joyous scenes as they celebrated being crowned European champions in front of 87,192 at Wembley.On Saturday, just a few dozen England supporters were inside the Stadion Wiener Neustadt to witness an 19th win in 21 games under Wiegman.The Lionesses remain unbeaten under Wiegman, who was asked after the match if she could remember what is it like to lose.""Of course you remember the defeats, but you never get bored with winning,"" she replied.The England boss can now start planning for next summer's World Cup after a ninth win in nine qualifying games sent the Group D leaders eight points clear of second-placed Austria with one round of games remaining.England have not conceded a goal during their qualifying campaignEngland had scored 68 times without reply in their previous eight qualifying matches, and it did not take them long to add another as Russo produced a clever finish in the seventh minute after Lauren Hemp had connected with Alex Greenwood's cross.Austria, who will now compete in the play-offs, looked lively and caused problems after England made three changes to the side that started at Wembley.Early in the second half, Earps was fortunate to escape after Julia Hickelsberger closed down the England keeper and got a touch before the ball rolled narrowly wide of the post.But with Millie Bright and Leah Williamson once again dominant at the back, the team clocked up another clean sheet on their way to a victory that was confirmed by Parris' thumping finish.Parris had only been on the pitch for a few minutes when she found the top left corner after being played in by Georgia Stanway.Beth Mead has a selfie with fans after the 2-0 win over Austria, a result that confirmed England's place at next year's World CupParris' contribution shows depth and talentEngland have now joined the likes of defending world champions the United States - who they face in a friendly at Wembley on 7 October - Brazil, South Africa, Sweden and France at next year's World Cup, which will take place between 20 July and 20 August.Will it be another glorious summer for the Lionesses?There is no doubt that White is a big loss, but Russo was busy and marked her start with a neat finish, which will help cement her place in Wiegman's starting plans.The England head coach has 10 months to fine-tune her squad before much sterner tests next summer.But Parris' important contribution after coming off the bench shows the depth and talent in the squad despite the loss of White and Jill Scott, who has also retired.On a satisfying night for the Lionesses, 20-year-old forward James, sister of Chelsea and England defender Reece, made her debut when she replaced Ella Toone after 79 minutes.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62765926
685,Luxembourg v Northern Ireland: Kenny Shiels' side win first match since Euro 2022,FRI 02 Sept 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"McKenna strike gives NI victory over LuxembourgNorthern Ireland won their first match since the Euro 2022 finals with a low-key 2-1 victory away to Luxembourg in their penultimate World Cup qualifier.Sarah McFadden opened the scoring in the 53rd minute when she powered home a header from Demi Vance's corner at the Stade Emile Mayrisch.Amy Thompson stunned Northern Ireland when she curled an effort towards goal which goalkeeper Jackie Burns could only spill into the net with 10 minutes to play.However Thompson, who had earlier been booked, was immediately shown a second yellow card for her celebration as Luxembourg, ranked 117th in the world, finished with 10 players.Kenny Shiels' side capitalised when Julie Nelson played in Rebecca McKenna, who found the bottom corner to hit the winner with five minutes to play. Although Northern Ireland cannot qualify for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next summer, the victory secures third place in Group D behind England and Austria, which will boost their co-efficient ranking for future qualification campaigns.As it happened: Northern Ireland beat Luxembourg 2-1Shiels' side made the breakthrough when McFadden guided home Vance's corner as Caitlin McGuinness and substitute Nadene Caldwell struck the woodwork.But the late drama in Luxembourg came after long-serving defender Nelson was caught hemmed in her own corner and a loose touch allowed Thompson to pull the hosts level from the edge of the area.Thompson, who had been booked for a foul on substitute Caragh Hamilton just six minutes earlier, went to replicate Chloe Kelly's iconic Euro-winning celebration when she lifted her shirt before immediately pulling it down, however referee adjudged it was enough for a second bookable offence and the goalscorer was sent off to the dismay of the home bench.It was the break needed after a dominant, yet wasteful performance by Northern Ireland and they got a deserved winner when Nelson picked out the run of McKenna.The Lewes right-back fired low into the net to secure the win.NI almost punished amid late dramaNorthern Ireland were dominant from the off and bossed proceedings, but lacked the clinical touch that helped them to a 4-0 win in the reverse fixture last September.Shiels was missing the injured Lauren Wade and Simone Magill along with Rachel Furness, who was unavailable for personal reasons, and the absence of the trio who had netted 15 of the team's 31 goals in qualifying was evident. Louise Daniel, Marissa Callaghan and Joely Andrews saw chances fall by the wayside.The visitors were almost caught napping when Amy Thompson's clever backheel played in Marta Estevez but the forward could only slot wide when well placed inside the area. McGuinness was tasked with leading the line in the absence of Aston Villa's Magill, and the 19-year-old, who is the top scorer in the Women's Premiership, carried her confident form onto the international stage when she hit the crossbar midway through the half after nicking the ball away from the home defence. That seemed to give Northern Ireland the spark they needed and Vance saw a close-range effort well blocked by Emma Kremer, however there was another let-off at the end of the half when the lively Estevez had a goal ruled out after she drifted offside from Thompson's pass.Sarah McFadden opened the scoring as Northern Ireland laboured to victory in LuxembourgShiels introduced three players at the break - Hamilton, Rebecca Holloway and Caldwell - and that lifted Northern Ireland into another gear. McGuinness almost forced Schlime into a good save after being played in by Caldwell, and seconds later elder sister Kirsty headed wide.McFadden's opener gave NI a deserved lead and the visitors were unlucky not to add more when Caldwell fired into the side netting and Callaghan forced Schlime into a save following Hamilton's powerful cross. Caldwell hit the woodwork as the chances continued to flow before Callaghan rounded Schlime but she could not convert with red shirts guarded the goal and Vance curled an effort straight at Schlime.The late drama, including Thompson's controversial second yellow card, provided a scare but Northern Ireland held on to secure third position in the group ahead of their final qualifier in Latvia on Tuesday, which is set to be a final competitive match for almost a year when qualifying for Euro 2025 begins.Line-upsLive TextLine-upsLuxembourgFormation  4-4-1-11Schlimé8Dos Santos19Have5Kremer15Tiberi17Jorge10Miller13Soares22Thompson11Schmit6García1Schlimé8Dos Santos19Have5Kremer15TiberiSubstituted forBeckerat 65'minutesBooked at 71mins17JorgeSubstituted forMarquesat 73'minutes10Miller13SoaresSubstituted forMendesat 65'minutes22ThompsonBooked at 81mins11SchmitSubstituted forLourençoat 83'minutes6GarcíaBooked at 39minsSubstituted forLudwigat 83'minutesSubstitutes2Ludwig3Delgado4Becker7Lourenço9Mendes12Goetz14Schon16Marques18Kocan20Lourenço21Albert23WeyerNorthern IrelandFormation  4-4-21Burns5Nelson4Robson3Vance2McKenna10McDaniel9McGuinness8Callaghan7McCarron20Andrews11McGuinness1Burns5Nelson4Robson3Vance2McKenna10McDanielSubstituted forHamiltonat 45'minutes9McGuinness8CallaghanSubstituted forMageeat 82'minutes7McCarronSubstituted forCaldwellat 45'minutes20AndrewsSubstituted forHollowayat 45'minutes11McGuinnessSubstitutes6Hamilton12Turner13McKimm14Wade15Holloway16Caldwell17Finnegan18Mason19Wilson21Beattie22Magee23WoodsReferee:Jelena PejkovicLive Text Post updateMatch ends, Luxembourg Women 1, Northern Ireland Women 2.90'+7'Full TimeSecond Half ends, Luxembourg Women 1, Northern Ireland Women 2.85'goalGoal!Goal!

It is a prospect Wales, who are set to be backed by a record crowd of more than 10,000 fans at the Cardiff City Stadium, will not want to contemplate having given themselves a golden chance to break new ground.Greece v Wales - as it happened & reactionWhile there is still much work to do before they can start planning for a first major tournament appearance, they remain in the hunt having done little wrong so far in this qualifying campaign.Their only defeats have come against runaway group winners France and they began as firm favourites to win in Greece, having thrashed the same opposition 5-0 on a freezing night in Llanelli last November.The conditions were very different in Volos, with thunder and lightning over the Panthessaliko Stadium in the late summer Greek heat, but that did not stop Wales taking control once more.The visitors - who left their most-capped player, Jess Fishlock, on the bench due to injury - settled after a scrappy opening spell, dominating possession as well as territory as Greece sat deep.Ceri Holland had Wales' first sighter, a header from Rhiannon Roberts' cross which looped over the bar, before the Liverpool midfielder's alertness almost brought the opening goal.Holland picked off a stray Greek pass and burst into the penalty area, drawing a fine diving save from Zoi Nasi with a shot destined for the far corner.From the corner which followed, Natasha Harding's cross-shot flew dangerously across the face of the Greek goal, before another set-piece saw Wales go in front in the 34th minute.Rachel Rowe drilled a free-kick from near halfway into the penalty area, where Gemma Evans flicked on for 18-year-old Jones.Though her initial effort was blocked, the Leicester City midfielder - on loan from Manchester United - made no mistake at the second attempt, driving the ball home from eight yards despite Nasi's efforts.Having worked hard for their lead, Wales almost gave it away inside two minutes as Eleni Markou burst forward only for Laura O'Sullivan to make a vital save.Greece showed more attacking intent in the second period, though it was Wales who came close when Jones was picked out by Hayley Ladd. This time she was denied by Nasi.Jones next embarked on a sparkling run which ended with Angharad James taking aim from 20 yards, but once more Nasi was on hand to save.Wales' failure to stretch their lead meant there was tension until the end, with Rowe making an important block when the ball dropped invitingly for Vasiliki Giannaka. With that, Wales' work for the night was done - now to finish the job on Tuesday.Wales manager Gemma Grainger: ""It' very satisfying. We wanted to get three points and we wanted the clean sheet.""To see Carrie Jones get her first senior goal, to see our players preparing to that level after we made a change to the team after Jess [Fishlock] picked up a knock, then being able to execute to that level - we want to be a tournament team and we know tournament teams have depth.""It's very pleasing for a number of reasons but getting into the final game knowing we need a point, and that that's a position we have put ourselves in, is really pleasing.""Our game management was exceptional tonight and this team haven't had to do that. For the best teams, 1-0 is a great result."" ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62644231
687,World Cup Qualifiers: Lily Agg seals World Cup play-off for Republic with win over Finland,THU 01 Sept 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Lily Agg's goal early in the second half sparked wild celebrationsLily Agg scored a historic goal as the Republic of Ireland booked a play-off place for the 2023 World Cup with a 1-0 victory over Finland at a sold-out Tallaght Stadium. Euro 2022 finalists Finland were on top in a goalless first-half, but substitute Agg headed home in the 54th minute to give the hosts the advantage.The result meant Vera Pauw's side clinched a play-off spot with a game to spare before the final round of qualifiers on Tuesday.The Finns, starting the night one point behind the Republic, went into the game in a state of disarray.Under-17 manager Marko Saloranta was in charge after Anna Signeul stepped down following Euro 2022, where defeats by Spain, Denmark and Germany marked a group-stage exit.Pauw had stated pre-match the Republic would deal with the expectation and pressure of being one match away from the play-offs. However, it was Finland who looked more likely to make the breakthrough before Agg's header swung the game in the home side's favour.The London City Lionesses midfielder, on as a first-half substitute for her third cap, diverted Megan Connolly's free-kick over Finnish goalkeeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela to spark wild celebrations, which were memorably replicated when full-time blew in Dublin.The Republic's final match is in Slovakia on Tuesday, before attention turns to a potential World Cup place.A convoluted play-off system, however, means the Irish could face as many as four games before their dream can become a reality.As it happened and reaction: Republic of Ireland 1-0 FinlandDespite the troubled build-up, Finland pressed from the off and Irish captain Katie McCabe had to be alert to hack Anna Westerlund's low drive off the line after goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan failed to deal with a corner.The Irish struggled to settle in front of a record crowd of 6,952 with a nervy start, much to the frustration of Pauw, but a good opportunity came when McCabe's thunderous effort was deflected out for a corner.Diane Caldwell powered a header off the crossbar from the resulting set-piece, but Louise Quinn was adjudged to have failed to keep the ball in play from McCabe's initial corner.The hosts were then lucky to escape when Linda Sallstrom fired towards goal and her shot took a touch off the returning Megan Campbell and Everton stopper Brosnan was forced to quickly adjust her feet and make a superb save.Brosnan's intervention settled the hosts and, although the tempo remained low, they began to make an impact.Denise O'Sullivan could only head straight into the gloves of Korpela from 10 yards, before the Spurs goalkeeper held the hard-running Heather Payne's low effort on the stroke of half-time. Memorable full-time scenesCampbell, in for injured Liverpool team-mate Niamh Fahey, caused problems with her long throws and Korpela sprung into action to stop Elli Pikkujamsa glancing the ball into her own net.The hosts got the vital goal when Agg headed home from a free-kick after Emma Koivisto caught McCabe.Payne had a chance to make it 2-0 after racing over the top, but her weak effort was saved by Korpela. A goalmouth scramble followed which set McCabe up for a long-range strike which flew narrowly over.Finland then struggled to break down the home defence, superbly marshalled by Quinn, and were restricted to long-range attempts from Sanni Franssi and Liverpool's Koivisto.As the game opened up in the closing stages, Korpela got a crucial touch to Jessica Ziu's cross, which took the ball away from the onrushing O'Sullivan.The home crowd held their breath when striker Sallstrom almost guided a header home in added time, but there were tears of relief and joy in the end as Pauw's team moved one step closer to a maiden World Cup.

688,Women's World Cup qualifying: Republic of Ireland put nine past Georgia to boost play-off hopes,MON 27 Jun 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"McCabe's hat-trick helped the Republic earn another easy win over GeorgiaKatie McCabe scored a hat-trick as the Republic of Ireland boosted their World Cup play-off hopes with an emphatic 9-0 win over Georgia in Gori. Arsenal's McCabe struck twice in the first half with Niamh Fahey and Megan Connolly also on target before the break.Louise Quinn (2), McCabe, Abbie Larkin and Denise O'Sullivan netted in the second half to complete the rout. The Republic move second in Group A, a point ahead of Finland. Both sides have two games remaining with Finland set to visit Dublin on 1 September. While the Republic were unable to eclipse their record-breaking 11-goal haul against Georgia in November, it was another fruitful evening for Vera Pauw's side, who are aiming to become the first Irish women's team to qualify for a major tournament. The tone was set early on as captain McCabe lashed a ferocious strike home after being picked out by O'Sullivan.Fahey (left) marked her 104th cap with her first international goalNiamh Fahey doubled the visitors' lead after 13 minutes with her first international goal on her 104th cap before Connolly added a third five minutes later.McCabe netted her second on the stroke of half-time, but even after having put the result beyond doubt, the Republic refused to relent as Quinn headed a Connolly cross past Georgia keeper Tatia Gabunia. Quinn headed her second before McCabe completed her treble with a neat finish 15 minutes from time as the Irish heaped the misery on a Georgian side who have now conceded 50 goals in this campaign. Substitute Abbie Larkin struck her first international goal before O'Sullivan wrapped up another hugely convincing Irish victory in added time as the Republic equalled their biggest-ever away win. Having leapfrogged Finland, the Republic will seal a play-off spot behind group winners Sweden with three points against the Finns in Dublin.

689,Ukraine 0-4 Scotland: Scots with one foot in Women's World Cup play-offs,FRI 24 Jun 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Martha Thomas scored twice in the first half for ScotlandScotland all but sealed a place in the Women's World Cup play-offs as a thumping first-half performance was too much for Ukraine in Poland.Only an unlikely defeat to the Faroe Islands in September would derail Scotland's bid to finish second in Group B behind runaway leaders Spain.Caroline Weir's early penalty was added to by Erin Cuthbert and a Martha Thomas double, all before half-time.Scotland could clinch a play-off spot on Tuesday if Ukraine beat Hungary.Even if they do not, Hungary would need at least a point against Spain, a side they lost 7-0 at home to last September, and hope Scotland do the unthinkable against the Faroes, the group's bottom-side.Reaction & as it happenedThose play-offs could become complicated, with the possibility of having to travel to the other side of the world just to qualify. But pre-match Pedro Martinez Losa's side would have bitten your hand off for the opportunity. Amidst the emotion of a big night for Ukraine around an hour from their country's border, their players lined up for the anthem draped in the flag of their country in much the same way their men's side had before ending Steve Clarke's World Cup dream.And they could have been ahead inside three minutes when, after Thomas was denied from close range, Kateryna Korsun galloped up the right wing on the counter attack, picked out Nicole Kozlova in the box, who lashed her shot over the bar. But the luck was with Scotland. Just four minutes later, Claire Emslie appeared to kick the leg of Korsun but the referee deemed it a foul the other way and pointed at the penalty spot. Weir duly dispatched the spot kick inside the right-hand post and the Scots were on their way.Even the lead did not settle Scotland nerves. Lee Gibson's clearance put her defence under pressure, Sophie Howard coughed up possession, and had Anna Petryk managed to hit her shot with more power, Ukraine may well have been level.Soon, though, it was 2-0. Thomas back-heeled into the path of Cuthbert, who rode a weak challenge and knocked the ball past goalkeeper Kateryna Samson with a composed finish.Before the game was a quarter of the way through, it was 3-0. Cuthbert's corner found Thomas at the back post who tapped it home.And in almost a carbon copy of the move came the fourth, again Cuthbert's corner picking out Thomas, who looped a header over a crowded box and into the far corner. Only a goal-line clearance denied Thomas her maiden Scotland hat-trick before she was substituted along with Cuthbert who failed to shrug off a thumping challenge from Inna Hlushchenko.Hlushchenko almost made an impact at the right end of the park when her looping shot forced Gibson to tip over the bar in Ukraine's best chance of the game, but Scotland's goal was not to be breached.

690,Women's World Cup 2023 Qualifying: Republic of Ireland earn vital point in Sweden after going ahead,TUE 12 Apr 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Kate McCabe opened the scoring for the RepublicThe Republic of Ireland earned a vital World Cup qualifying point away to Sweden after the hosts grabbed a late equaliser to draw 1-1.Katie McCabe's deflected strike put the visitors in front just before the break in the Group A encounter in Gothenburg.However, the Swedish pressure told as Kosovare Asllani levelled on 79 minutes. The draw sees the Republic drop to third in Group A, but with a game in hand on Finland.For the world number-two-ranked Sweden, the point secures their qualification for next year's finals.The hosts put the Republic under unrelenting pressure in the first half, while McCabe posed a threat as the visitors always seemed dangerous on the counter-attack.  Vera Pauw's Republic side won their last qualifier 11-0 over Georgia in November, but their free-scoring hosts eclipsed that victory with a 15-0 win in Georgia last week.Lina Hurtig, unopposed in the six-yard box, failed to make the correct contact to keep her header down and, as the pressure intensified, the girls in green had the woodwork to thank on 32 minutes.  Real Madrid striker Asllani angled her run superbly, but her shot struck the crossbar. McCabe's snapshot from the edge of the box forced Hedvig Lindahl into action and, moments later, Megan Connolly received the ball on the right touchline.With a training ground set-piece, she flung in a cross which the hosts failed to deal with and Denise O'Sullivan retrieved possession, laid the ball back for McCabe and the Arsenal attacker's fearsome 44th-minute strike flew into the net via a wicked deflection.  In the second half, the Swedes were denied by the crossbar again as Irish keeper Courtney Brosnan tipped Filippa Angeldal's strike onto the frame of the goal, before Stina Blackstenius missed the chance to bring the sides level with a free header on 72 minutes.However, the pressure eventually told 11 minutes from time as substitute Olivia Schough picked out Asllani and she cushioned the ball down with her chest before firing it into the bottom corner. Brosnan then made a terrific save to deny Fridolina Rolfo as the visitors hung on for a precious point.  They face minnows Georgia in their next qualifier in June, before a crunch clash with Finland in September which could well decide who finishes second and claims the play-off spot.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61027006
691,Scotland 0-2 Spain: Jennifer Hermoso double seals victory against competitive Scots,TUE 12 Apr 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Jennifer Hermoso's penalty gave Spain the lead in the first halfScotland put in a resilient and much-improved performance despite another defeat by Spain in Women's World Cup qualifying.Beaten 8-0 in the reverse fixture, Pedro Martinez Losa's side competed well but struggled to create against an accomplished Spain side.Jennifer Hermoso scored in each half to seal top spot in Group B and a place at next summer's World Cup for Spain.Scotland remain second, in a play-off position, with two games remaining.With an encouraging display on the park at a rain-soaked Hampden, 7,804 watched from the stands - a record for a home competitive match for the women's side. Reaction & as it happenedScotland now face a rearranged fixture away to Ukraine and a trip to the Faroe Islands, with two victories guaranteed to seal second place in the group.After a week in which the players criticised the Scottish FA for their promotion of the game, and claimed the governing body did not support them to the same level as the men's side, the hosts put in arguably their best display under Martinez Losa.In the first half they pressed Spain high up the pitch and got in behind their classy opponents on several occasions, but could not find the final pass or cross.It was against the run of play when Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas drew a foul from Nicola Docherty to allow her Barcelona team-mate Hermoso to score past Lee Alexander from the spot after 10 minutes.The performance was a vast improvement on the drubbing in Seville in November, where Scotland could not get near a Spanish side among the favourites to win the European Championship this summer.Jorge Vilda's team did dominate possession and Putellas had a headed goal ruled out for offside before the break.Scotland were pinned back early in the second period and Esther Gonzalez passed up a good chance to double Spain's lead.But the home side threatened to level too and produced a strong finish as Claire Emslie was played through in the box, but her first touch led her away from goal. Martha Thomas did put the ball in the net but the flag for offside had long been raised.Erin Cuthbert's deflected strike also slipped agonisingly by the post, before Spain finished the match with a well-worked second goal.Putellas again teed up Hermoso with a wonderful backheel and her club team-mate dispatched the ball past Alexander from close range.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60903505
692,Northern Ireland v England: Lionesses beat NI in front of record crowd,TUE 12 Apr 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Hemp & Stanway score twice as England beat Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland's dreams of reaching the 2023 Women's World Cup are over after a 5-0 defeat by England at a sell-out Windsor Park.Lauren Hemp 26th-minute goal opened the scoring for the Lionesses, who are all but assured qualification with victory.Ella Toone and Hemp added second-half goals before Georgia Stanway's double rounded out the win.The game took place in front of a crowd of 15,348 at Windsor Park - a record for a women's match in the country.Austria's 8-0 victory over Latvia means that, although Kenny Shiels' side mathematically could finish level on points in the race for second place, the Austrians' superior head-to-head record means Northern Ireland cannot reach the play-offs for the tournament in Australia and New Zealand next summer.""The one concern we have is that the girls don't believe they can beat the likes of England,"" said Shiels. ""That's hard. You want them to be confident.""It's good to play England because we learnt more from their methods. It's quite simple how they play. ""Their game plan is pretty similar to ours but they just have better players.""Sarina Wiegman's England side are five points clear of Austria and will qualify with a point in the penultimate qualifier between the sides in September.'Women more emotional than men' - NI boss ShielsWhat do home nations need to reach World Cup?England unfazed by vocal NI supportThe crowd, which far surpassed the previous record of 4,079, delivered with the pre-match atmosphere despite a downpour before kick-off which made slick passing difficult for both teams.As expected, the Lionesses mastered the conditions first and could have been two goals up inside 10 minutes. Stanway whipped in a powerful cross from the right and Ellen White failed to guide her header on target when many expected the net to bulge. Then, two minutes later, the impressive Sarah McFadden produced a superb block to deny Beth Mead after Hemp raced into the area, and Northern Ireland were lucky to survive when the lively Toone fired a snapshot wide from the edge of the area. Lucy Bronze then should have worked Jackie Burns from 10 yards while under pressure from Demi Vance but she fired wide.Kenny Shiels handed 19-year-old Joely Andrews, left, a start after her goal off the bench against Austria.White thought she had made the breakthrough on 21 minutes, which would have taken her two behind Wayne Rooney as England's record goalscorer, however she strayed offside when reacting quickest to Beth Mead's low drive, which was parried into the danger area by Burns.The opener came five minutes later when Hemp silenced the vocal home support with a sliced finish that deceived Burns and floated into the top corner.There was an element of fortune to the finish but it was no less than England deserved, and although Northern Ireland were able to venture into the visiting half they lacked the crucial pass or touch to unlock the visiting defence.Hemp should have made it two before the break but her header was over from Bronze's back-post cross, and White again miscued from close range on the stroke of half-time.England race clear after restartNorthern Ireland's hopes of springing a surprise comeback were all but dashed when Toone made it two on 52 minutes.Bronze burst through two Northern Ireland challenges on the right and her low cross found its way to the Manchester United forward, who kept her cool to slot into the corner.Lauren Wade forced Mary Earps into a low save from the edge of the area in a rare Northern Ireland attack to give the crowd another lift, but from there the first-half pattern resumed and England remained in control. Hemp made it three with a composed finish on the hour-mark when she danced around Burns and tucked home when racing onto the returning Leah Williamson's deflected pass.Manchester City midfielder Georgia Stanway, centre, netted twice to round out the winStanway made it four 10 minutes later with another finish from inside the area that left Burns with no chance.However, the Northern Ireland stopper will be disappointed with Manchester City player's second, which rolled into the bottom corner following a header across goal as the hosts began to tire.Hemp was denied her hat-trick after her tame effort was easily held by Burns, and defender Millie Bright, top scorer in the February's Arnold Clark Cup, fired over in injury-time as England left Belfast with a comfortable three points.""I thought it was a mature performance from us,"" said Wiegman. ""We dominated the game as well.""As a team we created a lot of chances and it doesn't really matter who scores. ""If they block one player, another player steps up. That's what makes you unpredictable and that's what we want.""The focus for both sides will now turn to Euro 2022 in July. It will be a maiden international tournament for Northern Ireland, where Shiels side will face familiar foes Austria and hosts England after their Group A opener with Norway.Hosts England open their campaign against Austria at Old Trafford on 6 July before taking on the Norwegians and NI in their final group games.Shiels says Northern Ireland have to try and narrow gap on England  ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61026979
693,Women's World Cup 2023 qualifying: Kazakhstan 0-3 Wales,TUE 12 Apr 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Highlights: Kazakhstan 0-3 WalesNatasha Harding scored on her 100th international appearance as dominant Wales claimed a 3-0 World Cup qualifying win in Kazakhstan. Harding became Wales' eighth centurion and fifth woman to reach the landmark.The Reading captain scored from close-range to put Wales 2-0 up just before the interval, after strike partner Kayleigh Green's 29th-minute opener.Wales were in control after half-time and added a third goal as Jess Fishlock smashed the ball into the net.The victory keeps World Cup qualification - and a first major tournament appearance - in their own hands, with Wales chasing a runners-up berth in Group I to ensure a play-off spot.Wales can guarantee a second-place finish with victories over Greece and Slovenia in their final qualifiers in September.This qualifier was a momentous one for Harding, who was visibly emotional during the national anthem and wore her heart on her sleeve throughout the contest. She reacted angrily to a bad tackle on her and showed extreme delight at getting on the scoresheet.This was a must-win game for the visitors and manager Gemma Grainger made only one change to the side beaten 2-1 by France with Green recalled after suspension in place of Carrie Jones.Grainger kept faith in goalkeeper Laura O'Sullivan, despite her error that led to France's winner in Llanelli, with the goalkeeper able to watch as Karina Zhumabaikyzy's cross hit the roof of the net on eight minutes.Wales initially struggled to impose themselves against a stubborn home defence, but they did find some space from a well-worked set-piece routine, but Rhiannon Roberts shot straight at goalkeeper Nazym Ismailova from an Angharad James floated free-kick.Natasha Harding's goal was her 26th for WalesAfter almost 30 minutes of impressive defending the home side's hard work was undone, with Green's strike justifying the faith Grainger showed in her.Sent off twice in qualifying and with Jones impressing against France, it was far from certain Green would be recalled.But her fantastic finish showed her quality as she turned and found the corner after Sophie Ingle and James had combined well.The goal lifted the pressure off Wales, who looked like scoring a quickfire second but Green headed over, Harding fired wide and Ingle's shot through a crowd just grazed the upright.However, they got the second in the 42nd minute as Ceri Holland's pinpoint cross found Harding at the back post and she applied a cool finish after beating the offside trap.Wales enjoyed almost 80% possession in the second half and Fishlock added a third in the 65th minute as she slammed home right-footed after another well-weighted James through-ball.Fishlock, Wales' record appearance maker, has now scored 34 international goals.Number 35 beckoned when the OL Reign forward went clear on 75 minutes, but she passed instead of shooting and Harding's effort was deflected wide, while defender Gemma Evans saw a late header held by Ismailova.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61065008

695,North Macedonia 0-10 England: Ellen White nets 50th goal to reach another landmark,FRI 08 Apr 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Ellen White is three goals behind Wayne Rooney's all-time England recordEngland maintained their 100% record in Women's World Cup qualifying with a thrashing of North Macedonia as Ellen White moved outright second in the country's all-time goalscoring records. White, who netted her 50th goal in Skopje, overtakes Harry Kane and Bobby Charlton and is three behind Wayne Rooney's England record of 53. In a ruthless display, Beth Mead scored four and Ella Toone bagged a hat-trick.The Lionesses remain top of Group D with three qualifying games remaining.Victory means England move to within touching distance of qualification before Tuesday's match against Northern Ireland in Belfast. They opened the scoring through Arsenal forward Mead, who netted two goals in seven minutes in the first half, before doubling her tally after the break.Toone scored England's third before setting up White, who headed powerfully across the keeper in the 41st minute to reach another landmark. The Lionesses, who won 8-0 in the last meeting with North Macedonia in September, were 5-0 up at half-time against the side ranked 132nd in the world. But with only eight shots on target from 22 efforts in the first half, England had room to improve, and they reached double figures within 78 minutes.Lauren Hemp was heavily involved as usual - providing two assists in the process - before coming off on the hour, while Manchester City team-mate Georgia Stanway grabbed a brace.With three games remaining, England sit comfortably top of Group D and still have not conceded a goal in World Cup qualifying under Sarina Wiegman.Is Beth Mead making herself undroppable?Relive England's victory over North MacedoniaWhite grabs 50th as Mead scores againHaving become the Lionesses' all-time top goalscorer in November, White is closing in on Rooney's England record - for both men and women - of 53 goals.She had plenty of opportunities in Skopje to add to her tally, after hitting the crossbar earlier in the first half.

696,2023 Women's World Cup: NI's hopes of reaching tournament all but over with Austria defeat,FRI 08 Apr 2022,womens-world-cup-qualifying-european,"Women's World Cup: Watch highlights of Austria 3-1 Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland's hopes of qualifying for the 2023 World Cup took a severe blow with a 3-1 defeat by Austria in Wiener Neustadt.Carina Wenninger, Nicole Billa and Barbara Dunst netted in a clinical 10-minute spell after half-time.Joely Andrews scored a late consolation with her first international goal.Defeat leaves Northern Ireland three points behind second-placed Austria, who are now favourites to secure the play-off position.England are runaway leaders in Group D, aided by their 10-0 victory over North Macedonia, and with both teams still to face the Lionesses and two lower ranked teams in their final three games, Austria are now in pole position to secure second place. As it happened: Northern Ireland fall to defeat in AustriaAfter a 2-2 draw in Belfast in October and the sides level on points, the game had been described as a cup final pre-match. Despite the big billing, it was a low-key first half with few opportunities.It was Northern Ireland who almost made a dream start when home goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger missed Demi Vance's corner inside two minutes. Sensing the opportunity, NI's record goalscorer Rachel Furness raced in to the back post but the ball evaded her outstretched leg.However, from there Austria began to dominate possession and press Northern Ireland deep in their own half. Dunst, who netted in the reverse fixture, curled an effort off target in a sighter for the Austrians before key forward Billa spurned two chances.Billa, with 41 goals in 76 caps, lobbed over from a corner on 15 minutes and the prolific forward felt she should have done better when she fired over after Jackie Burns' punch landed at her feet on the edge of the area. The heavens opened in Wiener Neustadt midway trough the half and both sides struggled to keep hold of the ball on the slick surface. Katharina Naschenweng saw a low effort easily gathered by Burns before Dunst again bent a wayward effort from range over the top.Northern Ireland improved late in the half but struggled to create in the final third as referee Stephanie Frappart blew for half-time right on the 45. Poor start to second half costlyNorthern Ireland's good defensive work from the first half was undone two minutes after the restart when Bayern Munich defender Wenninger flicked home Dunst's corner after evading marker Sarah McFadden.Needing a goal to keep their World Cup dreams alive, Kenny Shiels' side nearly mustered an immediate response after Vance's free-kick was spilled by Zinsberger, however Simone Magill and McFadden failed to capitalise in the resulting goalmouth scramble.Another Zinsberger mistake almost gifted Marissa Callaghan an equaliser when the Arsenal stopper spilled Abbie Magee's low cross and it fell in to the path of the Northern Ireland captain, however a great recovery kept Austria ahead and Rebecca Holloway failed to capitalise on the follow-up.But from there, two quickfire goals moved the game beyond the visitors. Burns misjudged Julie Nelson's pass 25 yards out and, making amends for her earlier misses, Billa slotted in to the unguarded net on 55 minutes.Austria, showing a clinical touch that had deserted them in the first half, made it three when Dunst tucked home from close range after being played in by Laura Feiersinger to make the most of 10 minutes of uncharacteristic defensive errors by the visitors.Joely Andrews netted her maiden international goal in the closing stagesNorthern Ireland regrouped well and began to press forward, with Vance's cross clipping the top of the crossbar and Furness firing wide after finding space at the back post.The pressure kept coming, and Zinsberger had to be alert to push Wenninger's wayward header out for a corner, from which Andrews netted a deserved consolation with five minutes to play.The ball was cleared to the substitute on the edge of the area and the 20-year-old's first-time effort rolled into the bottom corner after finding its way through a pile of bodies.Naschenweng hit the post in the closing stages but, ultimately, Austria were well worth a crucial victory which puts one foot in the play-offs with three games to play with head-to-head decisive to teams level on points.Austria can consolidate second place when they host Latvia on Tuesday, while Shiels' side will look to bounce back against England at a sell-out Windsor Park, with 16,000 set to be in attendance for the largest women's international to ever take place in Northern Ireland.Northern Ireland and Austria have also been paired with host nation England at the Euro 2022 finals this summer, which will be a maiden tournament for NI's senior women.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61026942

We competed with one of the best teams in the world and I am proud of that.""At the end they were time-wasting and that's a sign of the team we are. It felt like a tournament game.""The players are incredibly resilient and they have shown that again.""The games against France won't define where we finish in the group.""

I'm happy today and I want to share it with the players and supporters.""We have to rest a little bit but now we have a big challenge because we are slowly going up. We are looking up. It's important to have big ambitions and face big challenges. We have Chelsea in two weeks and we have to try and be consistent.""Next step is top 10, but if we are ambitious you want to get to something more and look at the teams in the European positions. Of course it is not in our hands to take a European place, but we have to try. We have to take this new challenge.""Villa were on top from the start and, after Luiz put them in front, they had numerous chances to extend the lead.Ollie Watkins had the best of the opportunities when he was put through by Buendia, only for his dinked effort to be kept out by Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto.The hosts might also have had a penalty six minutes before the break when Ramsey's goalbound shot was deflected over the bar by the hand of Stephens, but the video assistant referee turned down Villa's appeals.Bournemouth's limited threat came through the pace of their front three. However, Dominic Solanke, now without a goal in 10 league matches, lacked conviction when clean through and his hesitation allowed Mings to get back and make the block.Defeat left Gary O'Neil's side a point from safety, but there was a major highlight as David Brooks came on to make his first appearance since being diagnosed with cancer in 2021 - 534 days since his last game.Villa continue to make progress under EmeryUnai Emery hails 'best' Villa home display of seasonWhen Emery took charge in October, Villa were below Bournemouth in the table. Victory on Saturday means they are now 14 points ahead of them and they looked the superior side throughout.Even before going in front, Villa looked to have the measure of Bournemouth, with Buendia, flanked by Ramsey and Bailey, finding space between midfield and defence and looking to feed Watkins.After the goal, VIlla eased off and allowed Bournemouth back into it, but a couple of scares midway through the half shook them out of their slumber and by the break they were in the ascendancy once more.Chances were more scarce early in the second period, but Villa always maintained control of the game as Luiz and John McGinn patrolled the middle of the park, and the hosts always looked the more likely to find the game's second goal.Ramsey eventually provided it and Villa were able to express themselves for the final 10 minutes, creating chances at will as Watkins came close again and Mings spurned a glorious chance, shooting straight at Neto from seven yards out having been left all alone at the far post.With 11 games to go and only four points separating sixth and 11th in the table, Villa have the chance to make it an exciting end to the season and push for an unlikely European spot.Blunt Bournemouth struggle again on road'We gave Villa a head start', says Cherries boss Gary O'NeilAfter the high of toppling Liverpool a week ago, it was back to reality for Bournemouth as they succumbed to a ninth defeat in 10 away games in all competitions.The manner in which Villa were able to cut through them will be a concern for O'Neil and the Cherries have now kept only one clean sheet in 24 league away games.Bournemouth's best spell came after the opening goal as they managed to get players close to Buendia and frustrate the Villa creator.However, Villa adjusted, Bournemouth did not and the Argentine was soon collecting the ball in vast areas of space again - and if it was not him, then it was Bailey, Ramsey or left-back Alex Moreno exposing the gaps.Just as concerning was the lack of threat at the other end. Against Liverpool and Arsenal, Bournemouth were always dangerous on the break.They were again here but, with Villa also at their best on the counter, such chances were harder to come by, especially after going behind so early.Tasked with trying to break down a set Villa backline, Bournemouth rarely troubled Emi Martinez in the home goal as they suffered another disappointing day on the road.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64923720

There was no intent from the Spaniard, but Salisbury wasted little time in brandishing the red card after being told to review the tackle on his monitor.Unused substitute Matheus Nunes was also shown a red card deep into second-half stoppage time after remonstrating with the officials in the aftermath of Rodrigo's late goal.After conceding four for the first time since October, Wolves' meeting with Nottingham Forest after the international break now takes on added importance.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64923722

Everton's improved resilience under Dyche was on show again and 22-year-old local product Simms was the hero with a superb late equaliser to wreck Chelsea's hopes of a fourth consecutive win. Chelsea broke down Everton's resistance seven minutes after the break when the excellent Joao Felix drilled home a low drive, but they were pegged back when Abdoulaye Doucoure scrambled home an equaliser from a corner after 69 minutes. Everton were only on level terms for seven minutes until Kai Havertz scored from the spot after Reece James was fouled by James Tarkowski - but there was to be a late twist in the tale. Dyche had put Simms on to rescue a point and he delivered in style with a powerful run and finish a minute from time. Reaction to Chelsea's draw with EvertonHow did you rate Chelsea's performance?

They kept Chelsea at arm's length until the second half then reacted superbly to going behind twice, especially when they gathered themselves again when all looked lost after Havertz's penalty. Everton were strong in defence throughout, prepared to throw bodies on the line, and showed their threat from set pieces once again when Doucoure headed in at the far post from a corner. The high point, however, was the manner in which youngster Simms - back at Everton after a loan spell at Sunderland - outmuscled Kalidou Koulibaly and raced on to beat Chelsea keeper Kepa with a cool finish.

Felix brought class to proceedings and fully merited his goal, but he was substituted late on as Potter adopted a more conservative approach which ultimately failed to secure the desired result.

705,Nottingham Forest 1-2 Newcastle: Alexander Isak scores dramatic late winner over Forest,FRI 17 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Newcastle's winning Premier League goal was a 90th-minute penalty for only the second time, the other occasion coming in December 2007 against Fulham via a Joey Barton penaltyNewcastle's Alexander Isak scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner at Nottingham Forest from the penalty spot to keep their hopes of a top-four finish firmly alive.Isak, who had earlier cancelled out Emmanuel Dennis' opener in the first half, coolly placed his spot-kick into the right corner after Moussa Niakhate was penalised for handball in the box.In an eventful encounter, Newcastle substitute Elliot Anderson thought he had made it 2-1 when he thumped in a header at the back post, only for it to be ruled out by VAR for offside in the build-up.Newcastle were on top for large spells and hit the crossbar twice in the first half, either side of a glorious chance fired over by Joe Willock from close range. Forest's opener came against the run of play when Newcastle defender Sven Botman unforgivably gifted possession to Dennis, who smartly chipped it over the players standing guard on the goalline. The visitors' pressure eventually paid off when Willock set-up Isak for a precise volley into the far corner on the stroke of half-time and the Swedish striker later delivered the winner to spark celebratory scenes in the away end in Nottingham.The result leaves Newcastle just a point behind Tottenham in fifth - and still with a game in hand - while Forest remain two points above the relegation zone.Newcastle showed 'brilliant' character - HoweNewcastle's effort pays off as Forest woes continueNewcastle were made to work hard for their victory but it was well deserved.They had already forced Forest goalkeeper Keylor Navas into action on numerous occasions in the second half as pressure grew inside the hosts' half, while defender Serge Aurier made a goalline clearance and striker Jacob Murphy volleyed wide from close range.Luck appeared to be on Forest's side when Anderson's goal was ruled out for offside in the build-up, but Newcastle were eventually rewarded for their endeavour as Isak stepped up again to deliver the goods.It was the first time this season Newcastle had come from behind to win in the Premier League and it strengthens their challenge for a Champions League qualification spot.It was also another impressive showing from Isak, who now has six goals in 10 Premier League appearances after also netting in the 2-1 win over Wolves last weekend.Travelling supporters remained packed in the stands long after the final whistle celebrating with the players on the pitch and chanting to their success in what could prove to be a significant result. For Forest it was another disappointing result. The danger of relegation remains and they were not a match for Newcastle on Friday evening.They had a late chance through Brennan Johnson in the dying minutes but did not trouble goalkeeper Nick Pope anywhere near enough.Forest made poor decisions for Newcastle goals - Cooper",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64911104
706,Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0 Crystal Palace: Patrick Vieira calls for a change of 'mindset' from Eagles,WED 15 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Crystal Palace have not scored for 425 minutes in the Premier LeaguePatrick Vieira says his Crystal Palace side need to change their ""mindset"" to end their 11-game winless run that has dragged them towards a relegation battle.Palace have managed just four goals since the turn of the year and only fellow strugglers Everton, Wolves and Southampton have scored less than the Eagles' 21 goals this term.A third consecutive 1-0 defeat, on Wednesday against a Brighton side chasing European football, followed a frustratingly familiar pattern for Vieira with his side spurning three good chances to take control of the game in the opening 10 minutes and missing two gilt-edged chances to level.""We were aggressive enough but with a lack of talent at times, killer instinct and ruthlessness to put the ball in the net,"" said Vieira.""The problem is we don't score those goals and we don't make the right decisions in the last third. It is confidence. ""We showed the character and personality and played some really good football at times. When you look at those aspects, it's positive.""But the most important is to score and we have to keep being positive and change our mindset, especially the front players. The players need to understand those opportunities are important.""Brighton news and fan viewsGo straight to all the best Palace contentWhile Wilfried Zaha, Odsonne Edouard and Michael Olise were unable to make an early breakthrough for the Eagles, Solly March's goal proved decisive, with the winger clinically finishing into the bottom left corner from Kaoru Mitoma's incisive pass.Roberto de Zerbi's side always looked the more accomplished after that and move level on 42 points with sixth-placed Liverpool, while they are six behind Tottenham in fourth, with two games in hand.The result will only deepen concerns at Palace, who sit 12th in the table but just three points above the bottom three.However, Vieira had few complaints about the performance of goalkeeper Joe Whitworth on his Palace debut - a memorable night for the 19-year-old as he deputised for the injured Vicente Guaita. The teenager, who grew up as an Eagles supporter and was also a club ball boy, was given little chance by March's unerring finish but kept his side in the game after the break by superbly saving Pervis Estupinan's low shot and an Alexis Mac Allister header.""There was no doubt about his confidence,"" Vieira added. ""He is a confident young player who knows the club up and down. He showed he has talent.""Palace pay for profligacyVieira's last MOTD interview: Brighton 1-0 Crystal Palace - Vieira criticises Eagles' lack of killer instinctHaving pressed and pressurised Brighton into several early mistakes, the visitors could and should have been well ahead by the time March opened the scoring in the 15th minute. Zaha's wriggling run through the home defence caused Seagulls goalkeeper Jason Steele to readjust hastily to prevent an opening-minute goal for the visitors. But their was a distinct lack of conviction shown with the chances then presented to French forward Edouard - who headed wide under no pressure - and Olise's attempt that Steele saved with the winger converging on goal. Joachim Andersen's tame effort and substitute Naouirou Ahamada's late miss - dragging a shot wide with the full goal to aim at - summed up a miserable night for Palace in attack.Brighton continue their chargeBrighton 1-0 Crystal Palace: The players believe in our style, says Roberto de ZerbiWhile this was far from Brighton at their brilliant best, they still got the job done in a manner that their fans have become accustomed to - by attempting to dominate possession. A sign of the Seagulls' progress in recent weeks can be seen by the attitude in the stands, with draws at Leeds and in the reverse fixture against Palace now viewed as dropped points. And had they not had a goal incorrectly ruled out by VAR for offside at Selhurst Park last month, their European hopes would be even greater. As it was, De Zerbi was able to rest Adam Webster and Evan Ferguson for the majority of the contest and still see his side eke out a valuable three points courtesy of March, who is enjoying his best goalscoring return in a season. The 28-year-old, who also scored in last weekend's draw at Leeds, provided a useful nudge to Gareth Southgate, who names his latest England squad on Thursday.""Every English player wants to work towards playing for their national team,"" March said.""It would be an honour but I have to keep doing what I am doing and let's see what happens.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62859264

708,Fulham 0-3 Arsenal: Gunners restore five-point lead at top of table with convincing win,SUN 12 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Gabriel Martinelli scored his 12th league goal of the season in Arsenal's win at FulhamArsenal restored their five-point advantage at the top of the Premier League in outstanding fashion with a ruthless victory at Fulham. Mikel Arteta's side responded to Manchester City's narrow victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday night by wrapping up this win by half-time as they opened up a 3-0 lead with a devastating attacking display. Gabriel Martinelli had already had a goal narrowly ruled out for offside by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), before defender Gabriel headed in Leandro Trossard's corner after 21 minutes - the first of a trio of assists for the Belgian. Trossard then crossed for Martinelli to beat the static Antonee Robinson to head home at the far post five minutes later, before providing the delivery for captain Martin Odegaard's cool finish in first-half stoppage time. Fulham mounted a belated threat after the break as visiting keeper Aaron Ramsdale denied Bobby de Cordova-Reid, while Tosin Adarabioyo headed against the woodwork. Arsenal, however, were always in control and Arteta was able to re-introduce influential striker Gabriel Jesus for the first time since he required knee surgery after being injured playing for Brazil against Cameroon at the World Cup for a 13-minute cameo.Team news followed by live text coverage of Sunday's Premier League actionVisit our Fulham pageGo straight to our Arsenal contentTrossard stands out as Gunners pass another testThis had all the hallmarks of a hazardous fixture for Arsenal given Fulham's impressive campaign and the pressure on after Manchester City reduced their lead to two points.But, once again, the steel, character and skill that has characterised their season was on show. The £21m capture of Trossard from Brighton in January looks increasingly shrewd by the week and he ran riot down Fulham's right flank, taking on the role of creator-in-chief before being substituted to a standing ovation in the closing stages. Arsenal have been presented with examinations of different types on a regular basis in this impressive attempt to win a first title since 2004 - and they passed this one with flying colours.The Gunners dug deep to come from two goals down to beat Bournemouth in the 97th minute in last weekend's game at Emirates Stadium, while here they stamped their authority all over a lacklustre Fulham from the first whistle. Manchester City had asked the question by winning at Selhurst Park. Arsenal provided the answer at Craven Cottage with their fifth successive Premier League win.Fulham in danger of fadingMarco Silva's Fulham have been an outstanding addition to the  top flight this season - a surprise package given they were rated as relegation favourites by many. Here, however, they were well short of the standards they have set and this comprehensive defeat capped a disappointing week after losing the west London derby at Brentford on Monday. There were mitigating circumstances with two of their most influential performers missing, Willian ruled out with a back muscle injury and Joao Palhinha suspended. The goals have also dried up for main marksman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has 11 this season, but last scored in January.After a below-par display, Fulham only came to life after the break when the game was effectively over. Currently in eighth place, they have done so well to put themselves in contention for European football next season.Silva's main task now is to ensure the conclusion to this campaign does not drift away into anti-climax.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64852078

Casemiro was dismissed after 34 minutes of the 0-0 draw for a tackle on Carlos Alcaraz, but Ten Hag has not ruled out an appeal.The midfielder's sending off followed a VAR review, with referee Anthony Taylor overturning his initial decision to show a yellow card for a tackle that hit the top of the ball first before going into Southampton forward Alcaraz's leg.As Casemiro was also dismissed against Crystal Palace last month, an additional game will be added to an automatic three-match ban, meaning he won't be able to play a domestic match again until the trip to Nottingham Forest on 15 April.""When you freeze anything it looks bad - but everyone who knows something about top football knows what is bad and what is fair,"" said Ten Hag. ""And Casemiro is a really fair player. Tough but fair.""It shows, he had played over 500 games in big leagues and never been sent off. Now it has happened twice.""Ten Hag complained about the lack of consistency in the use of VAR, noting the referee was not sent to the monitor to review controversial incidents in Saturday's game between Leicester and Chelsea. Despite having a man advantage for almost an hour and managing 17 shots, Southampton were unable to capitalise and remain bottom of the Premier League. Even before Casemiro's early exit, David de Gea needed to make a brilliant reaction save to turn away Theo Walcott's close-range header.De Gea then produced a one-handed save after the break when Walcott ran clear of the home defence, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line when Scott McTominay turned a Kyle Walker-Peters cross towards his own goal. In addition, James Ward-Prowse's free-kick skimmed of the top of the bar and Walker-Peters also hit a post with an angled drive.United had some dangerous moments themselves, with captain Bruno Fernandes' goalbound effort tipped on to the inside of a post by Gavin Bazunu.The result consolidated United's top-four position, whilst Southampton are effectively three points from safety given their goal difference, with 12 games of the campaign remaining.Go straight to all the best Manchester United contentVisit our Southampton pageSouthampton show improvementDespite their position in the table, Southampton's form is good.They have now picked up seven points from four games since Nathan Jones was sacked on 12 February.It represents their most productive run since August and Wednesday's rearranged game with Brentford does offer the opportunity for Ruben Selles' side to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time since the end of October.Nevertheless, their goalscoring is a concern - in only one league match since August have they scored more than once. They had the chances to improve that statistic at Old Trafford but couldn't make them count.Casemiro's ill disciplineCasemiro has been one of the key reasons behind United's improvement this season.But the positivity around the Brazilian is in danger of being undermined by his disciplinary record.Sent off against Crystal Palace last month for grabbing Will Hughes round the neck following a mass confrontation, his latest red card was also triggered by the intervention of VAR.Casemiro did play the top of the ball first but Taylor decided the tackle was dangerous.Ten Hag said Casemiro was emotional in the dressing room afterwards.

""Alexander Isak scored a massive goal for us. When it's a one-goal lead, it's very delicate. It should have been more at half-time.""Wolves came back into the game, but the character shown by the group to go again and get the winning goal is a great feeling for us.""After a quiet start, their opener arrived when Kieran Trippier's dangerous free kick was met by Isak, who edged clear of his marker and buried a powerful header into the corner.That sparked Newcastle into life and they came close to a second goal when Bruno Guimaraes hit the bar with a header from close range after Dan Burn had helped Trippier's corner back into the six-yard box.Trippier was guilty of a defensive error to allow Wolves to level in the second half when he slipped and collided with Pope as he attempted a clearance, the ball falling at the feet of Hwang, who tapped into an open net seconds after coming on to the pitch.After Almiron restored Newcastle's lead, Sven Botman came close to a third in stoppage time when he blazed wide from six yards after some wonderful interplay between the Paraguayan and Guimaraes.Wolves rue non-penalty callThough Newcastle deserved their victory, Wolves will feel the decisive moment of the match went against them when it was still goalless.Pope miscontrolled a back pass that was intercepted by Jimenez and the Mexico striker appeared to be bodychecked by the England goalkeeper as he attempted to run on to the ball.Referee Madley, who was a considerable distance away, waved away their appeals and the video assistant referee did not ask the official to take a second look on the monitor.""For me, we should have had a penalty. We are very unlucky with the referee,"" Lopetegui told Sky Sports.""In the second half, we improved a lot. We changed a lot of things and were able to get at them.""It was a pity that we had no changes left to make after they scored. We lost against a very good team.""Despite going into the game as the Premier League's lowest scorers, Wolves created a number of decent opportunities, with Daniel Podence hitting the post with a fizzing low drive shortly before the interval, while Pedro Neto and Joao Moutinho drew smart stops from Pope before Hwang's equaliser.But the defeat, combined with results elsewhere over the weekend, has allowed a number of teams below Wolves to close the gap in what becoming an unpredictable relegation battle, with just five points separating the bottom nine.That makes Wolves' next two matches, against fellow strugglers Leeds and Nottingham Forest, hugely significant as they look to secure a fifth successive season in the top flight.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64852077

The Blues started the day 18th but capitalised on teams around them failing to win by moving out of the Premier League relegation zone, leaping two points and three places above trouble.McNeil's delightful strike after just 35 seconds gave the hosts the perfect start, rasping a finish across goal which nestled into the far corner.Buoyed by a vocal crowd, the home side were swarming all over the Bees and created much the better chances with Demarai Gray seeing a second goal ruled out for handball by VAR.Brentford looked to salvage something from the game but were not at their best, Ethan Pinnock having a header cleared off the line by McNeil and Kevin Schade heading wide at the far post as their 12-match unbeaten run ended.Manager Dyche said: ""I spoke to the players and media about building a firmer mentality in my way and my thinking of football.""The players are adapting, working hard, but we are finding that balance in making the defence more resilient and creating more chances.""There is no lack of effort since I have been here and the crowd play a massive part for us in the end. They are on it - the energy from them helps the players enormously, but it is just another step.""Wins are to be enjoyed in the Premier League. There are strong signs that the mentality is growing.""Reaction from Saturday's Premier League gamesBattling Toffees given hopeDyche said ""every"" league game is now a must-win as he looks to preserve Everton's top-flight status.But after seeing Bournemouth beat Liverpool earlier on Saturday, then Nottingham Forest, Leicester and Leeds all dropping points around them, the Toffees needed a win.A gritty, battling performance allowed them to hold on to McNeil's first-minute goal to collect their third 1-0 victory in seven games since Dyche's appointment in January.After 26 games this season Everton had 22 points, identical to the same stage under Frank Lampard last term when the former Chelsea boss guided them to safety.Five victories in their remaining games was sufficient on that occasion, and now they have real hope of doing the same under the ex-Burnley manager - with Dyche's former Clarets player McNeil the match-winner at Goodison Park.Everton should have been out of sight but Michael Keane headed wide when the goal was gaping after beating David Raya to the ball, while Amadou Onana screwed over from eight yards with the goal at his mercy.The lively Gray - who was unlucky to have a goal chalked off - saw a low shot saved by Raya and the Brentford goalkeeper also kept out Alex Iwobi's close-range effort from the resulting corner.""The win was satisfying for different reasons,"" said Dyche. ""The first half we were very good, you could arguably say we should have gone more in front - we were effective.""In the second half they were a team 12 unbeaten, a good outfit that has matured and they came back into it.""It was good play from them. They ask questions of you with some very good players. It gets nervy but we gave them too many turnovers with the ball. You have to find ways of winning Premier League matches.""Thomas Frank's side last lost in the Premier League back in October but were second best for large periods as their run came to an end.Striker Ivan Toney was well shackled by Everton's centre-halves, while Rico Henry had a header blocked on the line by Seamus Coleman.With the visitors in desperate search of an equaliser keeper Raya trotted upfield in injury time, but sent a free header from 10 yards past the post.Frank said: ""I don't know how many teams in the last five years have gone 12 unbeaten in the Premier League, apart from Manchester City and Liverpool.""But that is the past and for the history books.

They are still only 10th but now sit just two points off a potential European place.They led from their first major chance when Chilwell met Kalidou Koulibaly's cross to smash home, a goal he celebrated against his former employers.It could have been even better with Felix clipping a shot past Danny Ward which hit the post, then finding the net from Ruben Loftus-Cheek's cross. With everyone back at the centre circle ready to restart, it was ruled out by the VAR because Felix was offside.Havertz did put them back into the lead with a clever finish from Fernandez's ball.The £89m Ukraine forward Mudryk sped away from Leicester's defence to slot in but he was ruled outside. Not long after he had his first assist in English football as Havertz crossed from the right and Mudryk headed down for Kovacic to lash in.The goal was checked by the VAR for a potential Havertz offside but the goal was given.Pressure grows on Rodgers?Leicester's season is ridiculously streaky. They started the season terribly and then went on a great run before the World Cup. Then they lost their first four Premier League games after the break, before going three unbeaten and now losing four in a row (five including the FA Cup defeat by Blackburn).This latest decline has taken them to within touching distance of the relegation zone and they were booed off at full-time.Five losses in a row is their worst run since November to December 2014. They have suffered 16 Premier League defeats in a season for only the second time - the most Rodgers has ever lost in a league season in his managerial career.Not taking chances has been one of their issues this season - and they had 17 shots here (to Chelsea's 12), but only netted once.James Maddison was one of their star performers again with five shots, two on target, and three chances created. But none ended up in the net.He should have had an assist when his free-kick landed on the head of Daniel Amartey in front of an open goal but the defender somehow missed.Dewsbury-Hall cracked a deflected shot off the angle of bar and post from 25 yards out.The chances continued in the second half with Harry Souttar having an effort cleared off the line by Conor Gallagher and Dewsbury-Hall mis-kicking when he had an easy chance from six yards out.Their misery was compounded when Faes lunged in on Carney Chukwuemeka and was shown his second yellow card.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64845518

Still we are there,"" Guardiola told Sky Sports.""Here in the typical winter game, a difficult one, we were there all the time and then we won it.""Now we have to do absolutely everything and next Tuesday and Saturday.

Their wait for a shot on target will now extend to a fourth game after setting a competition record since Opta began recording such data in 2003-04.They were handed a rare first-half opening when Olise dispossessed Foden in midfield and set Wilfried Zaha away, while substitute Eberechi Eze saw an attempt blocked amid a late search for an equaliser.Palace's five points in 2023 is the lowest in the division, and just four points separate Vieira's misfiring side from the relegation places before difficult trips to Brighton and then Arsenal.

Toney is playing under a cloud as he faces a ban after accepting breaking Football Association betting rules, but he was outstanding here as Brentford secured a deserved three points. Thomas Frank's side made a lightning start and could have scored three times even before Ethan Pinnock's shot deflected off Tim Ream to put Brentford ahead after only six minutes. Fulham are having an outstanding season of their own, and they finally gained a foothold before drawing level six minutes before the break when Israel forward Manor Solomon continued his rich vein of form, heading in the rebound after Andreas Pereira's free-kick struck the post. Brentford regained the momentum, with both Bryan Mbeumo and Toney hitting the woodwork with free-kicks, and were awarded a 53rd-minute penalty when Issa Diop fouled Christian Norgaard. Toney, as is his custom, beat Bernd Leno with ease.Mathias Jensen sealed the win from close range five minutes from time following good work by Kevin Schade with Carlos Vinicius' stoppage-time goal for Fulham nothing more than a consolation.Buoyant Brentford's European dream grows closerHow did you rate Brentford's performance?

Vinicius' late bundled goal gave the scoreline a flattering appearance for Fulham as it came with virtually the last kick of the game. Silva's big players Aleksandar Mitrovic and Willian were unable to exert any influence, snuffed out by Brentford's defending, and both endured a frustrating evening.

720,Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United: Reds thrash old rivals in Anfield rout,SUN 05 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Liverpool delivered the complete performance and Mohamed Salah became the club's record Premier League goalscorer as Manchester United were overwhelmed at a joyous Anfield. United's renaissance under manager Erik ten Hag already has the tangible reward of the Carabao Cup but Liverpool unleashed a brutal reality check on their progress with a severe thrashing. Liverpool took control of what had been a tight game, with Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford missing presentable chances, when former Old Trafford target Cody Gakpo applied a smooth finish to Andy Robertson's perfect pass two minutes before the break. The second half was a tale of sheer joy for Liverpool and unrelenting misery for United, starting after 47 minutes when Darwin Nunez's header diverted Harvey Elliott's driven cross past goalkeeper David de Gea. Salah bamboozled Lisandro Martinez to play in Gakpo for another classy finish three minutes later before the Egyptian resumed his long-time role of United tormentor by getting on the scoresheet himself. Salah ended a swift counter-attack by lashing a finish high past De Gea and the rout continued as Nunez flashed another header in from Jordan Henderson's cross.Salah then scrambled in the sixth to become Liverpool's highest Premier League goalscorer with 129, passing Robbie Fowler. He is also Liverpool's highest marksman against Manchester United with 12 - and 10 of those have come in his past five encounters. And in a fitting finish, Roberto Firmino - who has announced he is leaving Anfield at the end of the season - completed a remarkable game by making it 7-0 from close range. This is the biggest win in the history of the fixture, passing Liverpool's 7-1 victory in the 1895-96 Second Division.Liverpool are now an ominous presence in the chase for the Champions League places, standing only three points behind Tottenham with a game in hand.Mohamed Salah broke Robbie Fowler's record of 128 Premier League goals for LiverpoolFollow Liverpool v Manchester United reaction hereHow did you rate Liverpool's performance?

Send us your views hereLiverpool find the fire and fury Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United: Jurgen Klopp delighted with 'super-dominant' performanceLiverpool have resembled a shadow of their real selves this season. The old guarantees, such as intensity and firepower, have been missing far too often. They all returned here - and how - in the most spectacular manner as Manchester United, who have been undergoing a revival this season, were blown away by a team in full cry. Once Jurgen Klopp's side took control of a tightly contested game just before half-time, they were ruthless. They scored seven, and missed chances to get more.Klopp wanted this to be a pivotal week in the race for the top four as his team look to salvage something from a season that has, to this point, been below par.His players responded. Wolverhampton Wanderers were beaten at Anfield and United, to put it mildly, outclassed. Liverpool won 5-0 at Old Trafford and 4-0 at Anfield in the Premier League last season while United had a 2-1 win at home early in this campaign to get the Ten Hag era going - and this was another remarkable game to add to that catalogue. Gakpo was on United's wanted list before he moved to Liverpool in January and his two cool finishes showed why Ten Hag was a fan. Nunez demonstrated his growing threat with a double while Salah always rises to the occasion against United and punished them once more. There was even the perfect finale of a goal in front of the Kop for Firmino, who announced on Friday he would end a great Liverpool career at the conclusion of this season.  Liverpool manager Klopp resisted a fist pump celebration in front of the Kop - but for him, this day could not have gone any better. Embarrassment for Man UtdLiverpool 7-0 Manchester United: Erik ten Hag 'angry' with 'unprofessional' performanceIn seven days, Manchester United have gone from the high of their first trophy since 2017 with the Carabao Cup win against Newcastle United at Wembley to the pain of abject humiliation at Anfield.Bizarrely, United were right in this game for 43 minutes, with Fernandes and Rashford missing arguably the game's two best chances before Gakpo scored and the sky fell in on Ten Hag's team. United have had a heavy programme of fixtures but the manner in which they capitulated must be an embarrassment for manager, players and fans. There can be no excuses.Argentine defender Martinez, normally so reliable and combative, was taken apart, especially when Salah led him a merry dance to set up Gakpo to settle the game with Liverpool's third five minutes after half-time. To lose against Liverpool is a painful business at any time but to be on the receiving end of what was a record defeat in this fixture will send shock waves through Old Trafford. They must have thought it could not get worse than the 5-0 home thrashing last season - but this was and was inflicted in front of an ecstatic Anfield. Manchester United must now lick their wounds and return to Europa League action at home to Real Betis on Thursday - and those wounds will hurt after this beating at the home of their arch-rivals.

721,Man City 2-0 Newcastle: Phil Foden stars as City keep pressure up in Premier League title race,SAT 04 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Foden's goal against Newcastle was his fourth in City's past three gamesPhil Foden's superb solo goal helped Manchester City see off Newcastle and ensured the defending champions kept up the pressure on Premier League leaders Arsenal.Foden struck after 15 minutes, gliding in from the right and holding off two challenges before seeing his shot deflected home off Sven Botman. Newcastle responded well and were causing plenty of problems until City substitute Bernardo Silva slotted home to put the game out of their reach midway through the second half. The win means City move to within two points of the Gunners, who play Bournemouth later on Saturday, while Newcastle remain fifth, four points behind Tottenham.While the result will be disappointing for Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, as his side looked to bounce back from last weekend's Carabao Cup final defeat, there were plenty of positives for him in defeat.His side were on top when Erling Haaland set up Silva to make it 2-0 from the edge of the area, with Joelinton going close and substitute Alexander Isak denied by an onrushing Ederson.Isak was particularly impressive whenever he was on the ball and his return to full fitness will be a big boost for Newcastle, who have now won only one of their past eight league games, as they look to rescue their stalling season.Reaction to Man City v NewcastleWhat did you make of Manchester City's performance?

722,Arsenal 3-2 Bournemouth: Reiss Nelson gets 97th-minute winner after visitors score inside 10 seconds,SAT 04 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Philip Billing's opening goal was the second fastest in Premier League historyReiss Nelson scored a stunning 97th-minute winner as Premier League leaders Arsenal came from two goals down to beat Bournemouth.Bournemouth had taken the lead after just 9.11 seconds through Philip Billing, and went 2-0 up via a Marcos Senesi header.However Arsenal pulled level with goals by Thomas Partey and Ben White, before Nelson struck.The winger, making his first appearance since 12 November, slammed in from 25 yards in the seventh minute of stoppage time.Arsenal's Premier League lead is restored to five points, after they had seemed certain to cede ground to Manchester City, winners over Newcastle in the early kick-off.Bournemouth, meanwhile, remain in the relegation zone after threatening a major upset - and beginning at top speed.Billing's goal was the second-quickest in Premier League history - only Shane Long, who scored for Southampton after 7.69 seconds at Watford in April 2019, has netted faster.How did you rate Arsenal's performance? Have your say here.What did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here.Nelson colossal as Arsenal snatch victoryArteta on 'incredible' Arsenal comebackNelson had played just 64 minutes of Premier League football this season - having struggled with thigh problems - before being thrown on as a second-half substitute by Mikel Arteta here.Yet the homegrown talent was the unexpected hero, collecting a half-cleared corner outside the area and bending a superb strike beyond Bournemouth keeper Neto.The outpouring of emotion that followed was immense; the Arsenal bench cleared as virtually every player and member of staff rushed to celebrate with the match-winner.Nelson had earlier, with practically his first Premier League touch of 2023, provided the assist for White to equalise with his first Arsenal goal.White, brought on as a half-time substitute after Takehiro Tomiyasu endured a torrid 45 minutes, struck Nelson's deep cross first time and his shot was palmed away from behind the line by Neto, with referee Christopher Kavanagh giving it via goalline technology.What is remarkable is that Nelson, had everything gone to plan for Arsenal, would have been very unlikely to reach the pitch. He replaced Emile Smith Rowe, himself a sub for Leandro Trossard, who suffered a first half injury.However it is with unexpected twists, remarkable moments and incredible goals that titles are often won.Billing's rocket start in vain for CherriesDevastating to lose like that - O'NeilArteta would have wanted his side to make a fast start in order to restore their advantage over City. He got the exact opposite.From the kick-off, Joe Rothwell fed a pass wide to Dango Ouattara, whose low ball across the box was dummied by Dominic Solanke and missed by Gabriel, who allowed it beneath his studs. Billing escaped William Saliba's lax marking, and finished under Aaron Ramsdale.With the form which earned Gary O'Neil the permanent manager's seat a distant memory, and now just one win in their last 12 games, a win - or even a point - would have provided a real boost for Bournemouth in their bid to escape relegation.However, like Arsenal, their defence is their weakness. Nelson's strike was the 35th goal they have conceded in away Premier League matches this season - a division high.The greater damage however could be psychological, with players, fans and O'Neil all left in despair by the late winner.For a long time, Bournemouth defended their very early lead with stubbornness and co-ordination, marshalled well by goalkeeper-captain Neto, who made a terrific double save from Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka just minutes after Billing's opener.Bournemouth were happy to attack on the break, and should have gone two ahead before half-time, Ramsdale making a superb spreading save to deny Dango Ouattara as the visitors countered from an Arsenal corner.However they dropped deeper as the game progressed - until the decisive blow in the final seconds.Partey gets the late party startedWhile Arsenal continue to lead the pack in their pursuit of a first Premier League title in 19 years, they also have clear defensive frailties - they now have just three clean sheets in their past 18 home league games.Arteta may have thought the return of Partey to central midfield, his first start in three weeks, would have given a defensive boost. But the Ghanaian, playing in front of his national team manager Chris Hughton, was at fault for the Bournemouth second.Partey lost his man Senesi from a 57th-minute corner, allowing the Italian defender a free near-post header past Ramsdale.He started to make amends with Arsenal's first goal, volleying home from six yards - before Nelson took over.Match of the Day: Ian Wright's reaction to Arsenal's late winner",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64768041

""I'm sure the manager won't be pleased with the second-half performance but it's a win and we've been craving a win here for a while.""Great to get the three points and it gives us an opportunity to look up and not down.""Any thought of a relegation battle can now be put behind them, and with just five points separating Emery's side from Liverpool in sixth, a strong finish to the campaign could lead to European football next season.The performance level would have to increase significantly, but there was quality in flashes - particularly when Buendia and McGinn got on the ball - and there is the chance for a far more exciting climax to the season than looked likely a couple of months ago.More Aston Villa contentGo to our Crystal Palace page",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64768042

Bowen and Tomas Soucek forced Jason Steele - making only his second top-flight appearance at the age of 32 - into smart saves when it was still 1-0, but they rarely threatened otherwise and remain just two points above the bottom three.What did you make of Brighton's display?

Kai Havertz was one-on-one with Leeds keeper Illan Meslier, while Joao Felix smashed a shot from distance against the crossbar before Ben Chilwell prodded wide from an excellent position.After that there was a growing sense of deja vu around Stamford Bridge as Chelsea faded while Leeds grew into the game, with Jack Harrison sending a free-kick over the bar before the break.But Fofana ended Chelsea's run of 396 minutes without a goal when he rose to head home from a corner early in the second half.Leeds upped the pressure in the closing stages as the hosts dropped deep to try and hold on for a precious win, making for a nervous finale to the game for the home fans, but they held on to secure their second win this year.Chelsea remain 10th despite the win while Leeds are 17th and one point above the relegation zone.Follow Saturday's Premier League actionHow did you rate Chelsea's performance?

If the Blues can follow this up by progressing in the Champions League, then this could prove to be the turning point Potter needs.No joy away from home again for LeedsLeeds have to improve in front of goal - GraciaA significant factor in Leeds struggling near the bottom of the table this season has been their terrible away form.They had won just once before the trip to Stamford Bridge, picking up just six points, but they did comfortably beat Chelsea 3-0 in the reverse fixture and must have fancied their chances against a side struggling for goals.But that is a problem Leeds share. They have played plenty of excellent football this season but it often falls apart in the final third and once again they simply failed to trouble the opposition goalkeeper enough in this game. They did not manage any shots on target until the 90th minute, when goalkeeper Meslier headed a last-gasp free-kick at his Chelsea counterpart Kepa Arrizabalaga.A positive result at Stamford Bridge would have been a bonus for Leeds, who will likely target points elsewhere in their battle to stay in the Premier League.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64768039

Jose Sa made a good save but Jota kept the ball in and the Netherlands defender's second header from close range found the roof of the net.It audibly lifted the tension around Anfield and Liverpool's second goal was a much more pretty sight. Alisson found Tsimikas with a raking pass to the left and the Greece left-back raced into the area before pulling back to Salah.The Egypt forward guided the cross in off his thigh to move one goal short of equalling Robbie Fowler's haul of 128 Premier League goals for Liverpool.Following the chastening 5-2 home defeat to Real Madrid and the dour draw at Palace at the weekend, this was a much-need lift for Liverpool before the game against Manchester United this weekend.Liverpool 2-0 Wolves: Not easy to be positive - Julen LopeteguiWolves lack bite once againBefore taking the lead, moments of quality from Liverpool at a subdued Anfield were rare. When they did create an opening it was usually through the determination and running power of Nunez.In the 35th minute, the former Benfica striker raced on to a pass and cut the ball back from the touchline only to see the recalled Harvey Elliott wastefully head wide from eight yards.Just after the hour mark Nunez appeared to have put Liverpool ahead, finishing a loose ball smartly from six yards. However, Jota was judged by VAR to have caught Nelson Semedo as he carried the ball into the box and referee Paul Tierney ruled the goal out after consulting the pitch-side monitor.""I think you all saw the [disallowed] goal now a couple of times back and when you see it in slow motion you see the contact, but I still think it was a goal - but that's not important anymore,"" Klopp said.""The players don't have a replay and for them it's a clear goal of course. Then you have to react.""I was not worried but of course then you watch how the boys react - and the reaction was really good.""Liverpool fans may have feared this was going to be the defining moment of the game but Van Dijk intervened soon after with the goal his side's play just about warranted.Wolves defended stoutly and with organisation but were again toothless in front of goal, hamstrung by the absence of Matheus Cunha. The Brazil striker failed a late fitness test following an ankle injury picked up at Fulham on Friday.His replacement in the starting XI was midfielder Joao Moutinho as manager Julen Lopetegui reverted to a three-man midfield with the Portuguese veteran sitting alongside Mario Lemina and Ruben Neves.It effectively stifled Liverpool for some time, but Wolves may well have to offer a bit more than just discipline in the coming weeks to ensure their Premier League status for 2023-24.""It was frustrating because we didn't get anything - but we didn't deserve to get anything,"" Lopetegui said.""Maybe in the first half but in the second half we didn't keep the rhythm and when they scored it was more difficult of course.""We lost one match - it's a pity, but we have to change our mindset very fast as in three days we have another important match [at home to Tottenham].

Oliver Skipp's thumping 20-yard effort just after the interval put the hosts in command and their victory was sealed when Harry Kane turned home Eric Dier's knock-down late on.While the majority of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium were in celebratory mood in the final stages, Kane's goal saw visiting supporters head for the exit as Chelsea's recent woes continued. The Blues have now won just two of their last 15 top-flight matches and sit 14 points off the Champions League places. This result is likely to place more scrutiny on Chelsea's expensively assembled squad - with British record signing Enzo Fernandez at fault for the Spurs' opener - as well as Potter, who recently outlined the toll that criticism has placed on his family and mental health.Meanwhile, things are on the up for Spurs, who have won four of their past five league matches. The hosts now sit fourth in the table four points above fifth-placed Newcastle, who have two games in hand, and are expected to welcome manager Antonio Conte back to work this week after his recovery from surgery. Overall the hosts merited the three points and had come closest to breaking the deadlock in the early stages when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg saw his deflected effort go past a motionless Kepa Arrizabalaga but hit the right-hand post.The biggest talking point of an underwhelming first half was referee Stuart Attwell's initial decision to send off Chelsea's Hakim Ziyech after a melee that saw visiting forward Kai Havertz and home defender Emerson Royal booked. Having administered yellow cards to those players, Attwell dismissed the Morocco winger for a raised arm on the advice of his assistant referee before downgrading it to a yellow after the video assistant referee recommended that the official review his decision.Fan arrested over alleged homophobic chantReaction as Tottenham beat ChelseaHow did you rate Spurs' performance?

Send us your comments hereTottenham 2-0 Chelsea: Blues boss Graham Potter - 'A disappointing loss for Chelsea'Chelsea's dismal run continuesA team sheet containing six changes from their defeat to Southampton and the inclusion of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as a substitute underlined the feeling of uncertainty and flux around Chelsea's bloated squad. To underline the point, Gabon forward Aubameyang - who appeared to have been cast aside following January's lavish spending - was sent on in the 83rd minute to help retrieve a two-goal deficit. The introduction of the striker came only after midfielders Denis Zakaria and Mason Mount had come on ahead of him with Chelsea chasing a leveller. The loss of Thiago Silva to a first-half injury did not help the visitors' rhythm but once Skipp had opened the scoring, with a superb shot Arrizabalaga could only get a hand to, Chelsea hopes of getting anything from the game appeared to quickly recede.For all their neat and tidy possession, Potter's side had just two shots on target with only one of those from inside the Tottenham penalty area. Spurs on the other hand delivered the perfect counter-attacking display, making light of their 41% possession at home to record only their eighth win in 62 attempts against their London rivals in the Premier League.Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's 80 touches in comparison to opposite number Fernandez's 134 emphasised the difference in approaches.Meanwhile Kane - who ensured that Arrizabalaga felt his presence with a nudge in the first-half - clinically ensured there would be no way back for the Blues as he swivelled to prod in from close range.

The lively Brenden Aaronson pulled one shot wide, with Jack Harrison curling another off target.The one true piece of attacking verve came from Firpo, whose adventurous run and shot gives Leeds a first win in the league since 5 November and takes them to 22 points, a point and a position above 18th-placed Everton.Defeat for Saints - their first under caretaker boss Ruben Selles - means they stay bottom, four points from safety.Follow live text commentary of Saturday's Premier League games, including Leeds v SouthamptonHow did you rate Leeds' performance?

Arsenal's Ben White had his left arm around Ward's right as the ball came over at a corner, while White and Harvey Barnes also appeared to collide during the same incident. Arsenal's sense of injustice increased a few minutes later when their claims for a penalty, after Bukayo Saka tangled with Harry Souttar, were waved away by Pawson.Martinelli grabbed his ninth goal of the league season just 51 seconds into the second half when he calmly stroked the ball past Ward, sustaining a painful blow to the right leg when Wilfred Ndidi accidentally trod on him in the process of scoring.Saka also had a goal ruled out when Martinelli was flagged for offside, but Arsenal struggled to impose themselves as the second half progressed.Oleksandr Zinchenko, given the captain's armband by his club as a mark of respect in the week of the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of his native Ukraine, came close to a second goal in as many games when Ward pushed away the defender's curling shot.After this win and victory at Aston Villa a week ago, Arsenal now have the chance to make the most of home advantage against opposition in the lower reaches of the table, as they face Everton on Wednesday and Bournemouth next Saturday. Leicester 0-1 Arsenal: Rodgers laments lack of aggression against 'outstanding' GunnersFoxes fail to make impressionLeicester's 3-0 defeat at Manchester United last week belied the fact that they played well for periods at Old Trafford, as they attempted to build on the momentum from scoring four goals in both of their previous two games.But they struggled to get going against Arsenal, with the home side and the home crowd only finally stirred into life when Dewsbury-Hall's effort had curled just wide after 72 minutes.They lacked the spark that James Maddison could have brought them, the midfielder missing out after illness.The defeat leaves the Foxes just three points above the relegation zone, and following their FA Cup fifth-round tie with Blackburn on Tuesday they resume league duties with a visit to bottom-of-the-table Southampton on 4 March.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64686324

The striker found Bowen with a raking pass and sprinted into the area to slide in and connect with the winger's ball across the face of goal.Minutes later he was again in the right place to bundle in Said Benrahma's ball and all but secure a win that was rubberstamped when Rice bent in a beautiful strike from the edge of the area.Antonio, without a league goal since October, then popped up with a thumping header as Forest capitulated, allowing Moyes to rightly celebrate becoming only the third manager to win 250 Premier League games.""It's great to have 250 wins but it would have been better if I'd only had 275 games,"" Moyes told Match of the Day.""But 250 good Saturday nights out of a thousand isn't too bad.""I want to look at the teams above us.

It looks like we lost the game - we didn't.""We've spoiled ourselves with a lot of things, but we cannot suffer because of our own history.

For now, we just have to go through this.""If the pre-match words from Klopp were intended to motivate his players, a poor first-half showing suggested merely 'getting through' the rest of the season may well be the limit of Liverpool's remaining ambitions.Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold twice allowed Palace's misfiring attackers in on goal with elementary errors while Joel Matip also sliced the ball horribly to an opponent when under no pressure.Alexander-Arnold, while not alone in his indifferent performance, lost possession 20 times in a first 45 minutes at Selhurst Park that left much to be desired. At the other end Jota, in his first start since October following a long injury lay-off, did at least test Vicente Guaita before heading against the post from an improbable angle.Liverpool improved after the half-time introduction of Harvey Elliott and Salah was unlucky to see a fine curling strike come back off the crossbar.Cody Gakpo dinked a shot narrowly wide after being put through by Salah but that was Liverpool's final thrust as Palace ended the match on top.Draw against Liverpool a fair result - VieiraPalace still searching for winWithout a win in eight games since New Year's Eve, Palace have stalled in the Premier League and did not have a single shot on target against Liverpool.Badly missing the spark of the injured Wilfried Zaha, the hosts saw Mateta waste their best chance when he scooped against the bar after one of Alexander-Arnold's errors.Captain Marc Guehi also headed a good opportunity wide before an improved showing in the final 20 minutes roused their famously vociferous support.A minute's applause in the 77th minute marked this week's death of BBC legend John Motson, whose final Match of the Day commentary took place at Selhurst Park in 2018.Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Until the Israel international's intervention, Wolves had looked on course to claim a valuable three points courtesy of Pablo Sarabia's sweeping first-half effort. The Spain winger, who had earlier seen a weak attempt saved by home goalkeeper Bernd Leno, expertly turned in Raul Jimenez's knock down after twice linking with the Mexico international in the build up.Had Jimenez been able to turn home a second-half header he narrowly glanced wide the game might have proved beyond Marco Silva's side, who barely threatened until the closing stages.The result leaves the Cottagers sixth in the table on 39 points, while Wolves remain 15th, four points above the relegation zone.How did you rate Fulham's performance?

United are five points adrift of leaders Arsenal, although the Gunners have played a game fewer. Foxes rue missed chancesManchester United 3-0 Leicester: Brendan Rodgers says missed chances cost his sideThis was a case of what might have been for Leicester.Brendan Rodgers' side came into the game following a thumping 4-1 victory over Spurs last Saturday but will rue the failure to take their opportunities this time.De Gea denied Barnes and Iheanacho to claim a 180th clean sheet for the Red Devils, drawing alongside Peter Schmeichel's club record.Leicester's January signing Tete flashed a shot wide of the far post and James Maddison dragged an effort off target as the Foxes went home empty-handed.The hosts could have had a man sent off when Marcel Sabitzer caught defender Wout Faes on the knee with his studs, but neither the referee nor VAR took any action.Leicester will look to get back to winning ways but face another big test, hosting top of the table Arsenal on Saturday (kick-off 15:00 GMT).Manchester United 3-0 Leicester: Foxes made it tough for us - Erik ten Hag",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64614427

They're all for it.""Speaking to Sky Sports, he added: ""There are bits of it I want to build on and hope that we take it in. The players have been challenged, now let's see who's up for the fight.""Spurs condemn 'utterly reprehensible' racist abuse of SonTottenham, meanwhile, moved one point ahead of Newcastle, although Eddie Howe's side, beaten 2-0 at home by Liverpool on Saturday, have a game in hand.

He caught Arsenal cold on the counter, latching on to Matty Cash's long pass before beating William Saliba and finding the far corner.It took only 11 minutes for Arsenal to respond. Moments after Tyrone Mings cleared Eddie Nketiah's shot on to the bar, Saka levelled with a powerful effort into the roof of the net.Coutinho, making his first league start under Villa boss Unai Emery, put the hosts back in front, rounding off a wonderful team move with a calm finish from inside the area.On the hour Zinchenko found space at the edge of the box and fired in at the near post from a short corner for his first Arsenal goal, before Nketiah fired over minutes later.Martin Odegaard shot wide with 14 minutes remaining and it looked as though it would not be Arsenal's day until Jorginho and Martinelli's vital contributions.Gunners show resolveAston Villa 2-4 Arsenal: Mikel Arteta praises Gunners' passion during comeback winThere had been so much talk about Arsenal's title chances after losing to City, despite the fact they went into this match level on points with a game in hand.For long periods they looked like they may come up short again.But they proved their mental strength with those stoppage-time goals, as well as the fact they twice came from behind.There was no panic as they probed and pushed late on, even when Nketiah and Odegaard missed chances and Villa were going for it themselves.Winning titles is about overcoming adversity under pressure, and that is exactly what Arsenal did today.""We can take two big lessons,"" manager Mikel Arteta told BBC Sport. ""In the first half we did the simple things wrong and in the second half we raised our individual level and did the simple things right.""We totally merited the win.""Emery 'embarrassed' by MartinezAston Villa 2-4 Arsenal: Unai Emery says final goal was embarrassingTactically, Emery's plan was clear and it very nearly worked.Villa started the better and scored early. Even as Arsenal settled after Saka's goal, Villa maintained their threat through Watkins, Coutinho and Emi Buendia.Having the lead at the break allowed them to stay compact and absorb Arsenal pressure and, although they conceded again, Watkins continued to cause problems.Bringing Leon Bailey on could have paid off, but Arsenal found a way through to condemn Emery to defeat against his former club.While Martinez was unfortunate with his own goal, Villa boss Emery was furious at his keeper for going up for the corner from which Arsenal broke away to add their fourth.""Today I am very, very disappointed,"" said Emery. ""I am embarrassed about the last goal. I have never told my keeper to go forward. It's not the spirit.""We have to keep our mind clear and be smart. Today he decided it was his decision.

The Serbian was absent from the squad with a minor injury sustained in the warm-up to last weekend's 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest.They produced only two shots on target and found it difficult to progress into the final third, being penned back by Brighton for much of the game.Winger Harry Wilson, who replaced Mitrovic, attempted to provide some spark to their front line on the rare occasions that the visitors went forward yet often found himself isolated when doing so.Reid, who was deployed as the central striker, only had one touch in Brighton's box across the 90 minutes,But Silva may find solace in the improvements brought about by Solomon's introduction from the bench, with the Israel international adding pace and threat to an attack which had been sorely lacking in potency.Misfiring Brighton undone by own errorsBrighton 0-1 Fulham: Brighton made too many mistakes - Roberto de ZerbiThe game had seemed Brighton's for the taking from the early moments but their lack of a clinical presence in the final third proved to be their undoing.They had 21 shots to Fulham's five but could not find the cutting edge needed to beat Leno.It is not the first time finishing has proved to be Brighton's Achilles heel this season, with their 21 shots against Brentford in October also failing to produce a goal.With Danny Welbeck and Adam Lallana both absent through injury, the hosts came agonisingly close to an opener but could not find a breakthrough as Ferguson, Mac Allister and March all spurned chances.Fulham's low block made it difficult for Brighton to create clear-cut opportunities, although Leno was forced to make seven saves.Reaction to Fulham's victory over BrightonVisit our Brighton pageAll the Fulham news and views in one place",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64607247

Only former England captain David Beckham has managed more in the top flight, with 18.'Elite' Ward-Prowse closes in on Beckham recordAdam Armstrong could have given the Saints a two-goal cushion in the second half but was denied by Arrizabalaga's outstretched leg.The win gave Southampton their first league double against Chelsea in 35 years. They last achieved that feat courtesy of a 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge in 1988, a match in which a 17-year-old Alan Shearer made his league debut.Despite Saturday's victory, they are still bottom of the league table, while Chelsea are 10th.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64607244

""The chances we had in front of goal - we need to be better, [with] the calibre of players we've got up front we should be scoring them and putting them away.""Erling Haaland volleyed against the crossbar and ballooned the rebound over the top after Aymeric Laporte's header was brilliantly saved by Forest keeper Keylor Navas.But Morgan Gibbs-White's fizzed cross was tapped in at the far post in the 84th minute for Wood's first Forest goal.""I'm not blaming anyone,"" Walker told Match of the Day.

Forest were without centre-backs Scott McKenna and Willy Boly, who picked up injuries last time out, and Steve Cooper's side did not put together any meaningful periods of possession or chances.But, as City became frustrated, Forest were patient and ultimately efficient enough to take their opportunity when it finally came, their only shot on target all afternoon.""It is definitely a positive result,"" said Cooper. ""For me, Manchester City are the best team in the world. They are fascinating to watch and study. There was no shame City had the ball as much as they did.""We rode a bit of luck but we earned a bit of luck with the goal we scored.

747,Newcastle United 0-2 Liverpool: Reds end Newcastle run with clinical win,SAT 18 Feb 2023,premier-league,"Cody Gakpo scored his second goal for LiverpoolLiverpool's pursuit of a top-four Premier League finish gathered further momentum at the expense of Newcastle United's similar ambitions with a crucial win at St James' Park. Jurgen Klopp's side, who secured their first league win of 2023 in the Merseyside derby against Everton on Monday, took control with two early goals from Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo. Newcastle's miserable night worsened with a first-half red card for goalkeeper Nick Pope, ruling him out of next Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Manchester United at Wembley. Nunez powered home the opener from Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass after 10 minutes, then Gakpo scored for the second successive match seven minutes later, pouncing on Mohamed Salah's piece of creation to beat Pope. The Newcastle keeper then left referee Anthony Taylor with no option but to send him off after 22 minutes when he misjudged a dash from goal in an attempt to challenge Salah. He slipped and had to handle to stop Liverpool's Egypt forward from racing clear. Ironically, Pope's replacement Martin Dubravka is cup-tied for Wembley having played for Manchester United in an earlier round, leaving former Liverpool keeper Loris Karius as the most likely contender to face Erik ten Hag's side. Newcastle were unable to overcome the handicap as they went down to only their second league defeat this season, the first also coming against Liverpool at Anfield in August. It capped a disappointing build-up to Newcastle's first Wembley final since the FA Cup in 1999, but they still showed plenty of spirit despite their numerical disadvantage, Liverpool keeper Alisson turning Allan Saint-Maximin's shot on to the bar, while Dan Burn also rattled the woodwork with a header. The Brazilian also saved well from Miguel Almiron and Callum Wilson.Klopp will have left Tyneside highly satisfied after desperate away defeats at Brentford, Brighton and Wolverhampton Wanderers as Liverpool now stand only six points behind fourth-placed Newcastle with a game in hand.Liverpool increase pressureNewcastle 0-2 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp says it is early to say if side are back to bestLiverpool showed signs of recovering their old menace in the comfortable 2-0 win against Everton in the Merseyside derby.The trick was to follow that up against what has been a formidable Newcastle side this season given the inconsistency that has dogged the Reds' campaign. This is why Klopp will be elated with the outcome, not simply because it means Newcastle will feel the threat of Liverpool moving closer to the top-four place the Toon Army also have their eyes on. This was far from the perfect Liverpool performance, relying too heavily on the outstanding Alisson as their defence was opened up too often for Klopp's liking before Tuesday's last-16 Champions League meeting with holders Real Madrid at Anfield. There was, however, so much to be positive about as Nunez turned his good work into a goal with a thumping finish and the improving Gakpo was on the mark again, although Liverpool might be disappointed they did not add to their goal tally. Diogo Jota also delivered a dangerous cameo as he moves close to full fitness after a long injury absence, while fit-again Virgil van Dijk comfortably came through his first 90 minutes since sustaining a hamstring injury. This has been a very good week for Liverpool after so many disappointments this season, with successive victories providing the perfect tonic before the meeting with the side that beat them in last season's Champions League final. Newcastle thoughts turn to WembleyNewcastle 0-2 Liverpool: Eddie Howe says red card 'a huge blow' for Nick PopeNewcastle's fans swallowed their disappointment at the final whistle by instantly switching attention to their big Wembley date with Manchester United. Even that was overshadowed by the red card that rules out keeper Pope, such an influential figure in their transformation under Eddie Howe this season. Make no mistake, this is a bitter blow to their hopes of winning the first silverware since the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1969. And the added worry for Howe is that Newcastle, so impressive in this campaign, have hit a dry spell at the most crucial point in their season so far, their last league win coming against Fulham in mid-January. Newcastle will be lifted by the return of Bruno Guimaraes at Wembley, but there was also plenty for the home fans to be encouraged by, despite the result. Their side never gave up despite facing a virtually impossible task at 2-0 down and reduced to ten men, playing with character and creating chances throughout - although again there was a lack of end product. It was an anti-climax given the high hopes before kick-off, but Newcastle can now fix full focus on their biggest game in years and the chance to end that 54-year trophy drought.

748,Arsenal 1-3 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola's side go top with victory at Emirates,WED 15 Feb 2023,premier-league,"Grealish has scored two goals and made three assists from nine matches since returning from the World CupManchester City returned to the top of the Premier League for the first time since November as they leapfrogged leaders Arsenal with a vital victory at Emirates Stadium. The reigning champions turned on the power in the second half in the biggest game of the domestic season as Arsenal paid a heavy price for individual errors. Takehiro Tomiyasu's poor backpass allowed Kevin de Bruyne to loft a finish over Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale after 24 minutes but Arsenal deservedly drew level three minutes before half-time, Bukayo Saka scoring from the spot after City goalkeeper Ederson fouled Eddie Nketiah. City, lacking spark in the opening phase, improved after the break and had a penalty of their own ruled out for offside against Erling Haaland before they showed a ruthless streak to punish Arsenal. Gabriel lost possession to allow Bernardo Silva and Haaland to set up Jack Grealish for a deflected finish after 72 minutes before they ended Arsenal's hopes with 10 minutes left. Inevitably, Haaland was the scorer from De Bruyne's pass to put City top on goal difference having played one game more than Arsenal. Arteta has 'more belief' Arsenal can win title'This may be night momentum shifted in title race'Man City strike telling blow City have returned to the top of the Premier League by striking a devastating blow on the long-time leaders. City, by their own standards, have not quite hit the heights this season but they now find themselves looking down on Arsenal once more, albeit the Gunners have a game in hand. Even here, City lacked their usual fluency in the first 45 minutes and Arsenal arguably deserved more than being on level terms at the interval. And yet, once they moved through the gears in the second half City carried enough threat to put Arsenal away and return to the position they have occupied so often in recent years. City gratefully accepted the gifts Arsenal offered and once Grealish restored their lead - a touch off the luckless Tomiyasu sending his shot past Ramsdale - this game was done. Haaland's goal emphasised City's supremacy and they closed out the win with ease, the celebrations at the final whistle reflecting the significance of the result.Reaction from Emirates StadiumGo straight to all the best Arsenal contentVisit our Manchester City pageArsenal must hold nerve This defeat will be a bitter blow to Arsenal, coming as it did in front of their own supporters. It continued a recent stumble in which they have lost at City in the FA Cup and at Everton in the league, drawn controversially against Brentford on Saturday and now another damaging defeat here. Arsenal and manager Mikel Arteta must not get too down on themselves, although the scale of the setback here cannot be underestimated in the context of the title race. The Gunners were excellent in the first 45 minutes but Tomiyasu's poor back pass and Gabriel's concession of possession were the sort of mistakes you simply cannot make against this class of opponent. Arsenal must regroup and realise they are still right at the heart of the Premier League title pursuit - but no-one can escape the damage done by this result.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63224218
749,Liverpool 2-0 Everton: Reds return to winning ways after Merseyside derby triumph,MON 13 Feb 2023,premier-league,"Mohamed Salah has been involved in 100 Premier League goals at Anfield (71 goals, 29 assists) in 104 appearance thereLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said ""it felt like us, it looked like us,"" after the Reds recorded their first Premier League win in 2023 with a comfortable Merseyside derby victory over Everton at Anfield. Sean Dyche's reign as Everton manager got off to the perfect start with a win over league leaders Arsenal at Goodison Park, but the task he has taken on after succeeding sacked Frank Lampard was laid out before him in graphic detail as they remain rooted in the bottom three. Everton had actually kept Liverpool at arm's length before they were caught by a devastating counter-attack after 36 minutes, defender James Tarkowski's header hitting the post at one end before Darwin Nunez raced clear, squaring for Mohamed Salah to take advantage of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's poor positioning with a simple finish.Liverpool snuffed out any hopes of an Everton recovery four minutes after the break. And it was a special moment for £45m January signing Cody Gakpo, as he tapped in Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross at the far post for his first goal since arriving at Anfield from PSV Eindhoven.  ""The result is a massive relief,"" Klopp said to BBC's Match of the Day.""The better you play the more likely you will score. The whole performance was extremely important for us because we needed to make a statement.""Liverpool 2-0 Everton: 'The result is a massive relief, the performance was a statement'Reaction and analysis as Liverpool beat EvertonGo straight to all the best Liverpool contentVisit our Everton pageLiverpool show signs of lifeIt has been a miserable 2023 for Liverpool, encapsulated by heavy away defeats at Brentford, Brighton and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but the ease with which they were able to overcome Everton's admittedly flimsy challenge will lift the spirits. This was a good night for Liverpool as manager Klopp was able to include Virgil van Dijk, Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota on the bench after injury, the latter getting a rapturous reception when he was introduced as a second-half substitute for his first action since picking up the muscle problem that forced him to miss the World Cup in Qatar.  Firmino also got a late outing.Another big plus was Gakpo's goal, a huge morale-booster for a player who has been quiet - although it would have been difficult for any new acquisition to come into such a struggling side who are ninth in the Premier League table, nine points adrift of the Champions League places. Gakpo's confidence visibly lifted after his goal, showing assured touches and looking more at ease than at any time in his short Liverpool career.""The dream is that you score in the first minute of the first game you play,"" said Gakpo. ""In the end I have had to wait a little bit but I'm really delighted that I can score this one.""Another major plus for Klopp and Liverpool was the outstanding display of 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic, who showed astonishing maturity in midfield with a comprehensive range of passing, a sure touch and a willingness to engage in the physical exchanges. It was a complete performance by the youngster.Liverpool were nowhere near their best - they did not have to be - but the sight of Salah on the scoresheet, goals from trademark lightning counter-attacks and a clean sheet will change the mood around Anfield considerably before a crucial visit to Newcastle United on Saturday night. Liverpool's victory was their first in the Premier League since 30 DecemberEverton revert to typeEverton started the Dyche era with a performance full of passion and competitive edge to stun Arsenal, but this was a reminder of why they face a serious relegation battle, and evidence that the display against the Gunners was very much the exception in this season of struggle. None of the things Dyche expects from his teams was on show here. They were passive, slow and careless in possession - their major flaw once again exposed as they barely mounted a threat apart from Tarkowski's header that actually resulted in Liverpool breaking the deadlock. The absence of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, injured once more after figuring for an hour against Arsenal, underscores the folly in not signing a replacement for Richarlison, an error in the summer compounded by the failure to correct it in January. Liverpool 2-0 Everton: Sean Dyche - 'no lack of effort'Much rests on the unreliable fitness of Calvert-Lewin, with Dyche having to rely on 22-year-old Ellis Simms, making only his second Premier League start. The youngster, understandably, struggled on his own up front with no service. Everton now have a vital home game against managerless fellow strugglers Leeds United on Saturday and Dyche will want more of what they showed against Arsenal and less of what they produced at Anfield.

From the subsequent corner, the ball bounced off Luke Ayling and narrowly wide of the far post, with Rashford inches away from converting.But in general the first period was a fiery affair lacking in clear opportunities. And it was in keeping with the mood around Elland Road that Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were the subject of ferocious, but fair, early Leeds tackles.Ayling and Malacia also had a grappling match as the Leeds man kept hold of the ball when his opponent tried to snatch it from him to take a quick throw, and Leeds duo Junior Firpo and Weston McKennie and Manchester United's Fred were all booked as referee Paul Tierney tried to regain control.Man Utd substitutes changed the game - Ten HagLeeds in danger at the bottomDespite the complaints of Ten Hag after the meeting between these sides on Wednesday, the visitors were once again guilty of making a sluggish start.They were also fortunate not to concede early in the second half when Crysencio Summerville brought a low save out of De Gea, Jack Harrison prodded a shot narrowly wide of the near post and Ayling's effort deflected off Shaw.It was the prelude to a more positive contest in the second period, with Diogo Dalot crashing a shot against the bar from the edge of the area and Ayling sending an overhead kick straight at De Gea, who also turned away a Summerville shot heading for the far corner.With matches to come against fellow strugglers Everton and Southampton, Leeds badly need to identify a replacement for Marsch after hitting a brick wall in their attempts to lure Andoni Iraola from Rayo Vallecano and Carlos Corberan from West Brom.Leeds 0-2 Man Utd: Leeds pushed Man Utd for 80 minutes - Skubala",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64527481

Guardiola had issued a defiant response to the charges before the game, and City's fans reacted in similar fashion at a vibrant Etihad Stadium, singing songs about their situation and in support of their manager, and also the club's owner Sheikh Mansour.Match of the Day 2: 'Man City seem to have remembered where they need to be'City's players appeared galvanised too, and made the perfect start when Rodri headed home Riyad Mahrez's corner, but they had to wait until just before the break to add to their lead.Calum Chambers' attempt to cut out a Kevin de Bruyne through-ball saw him head the ball beyond his on-rushing keeper Emi Martinez and, although Erling Haaland could not convert from a tight angle, he had the composure to look up and find Ilkay Gundogan for a tap-in.Mahrez made it 3-0 from the penalty spot soon afterwards, after Jacob Ramsey had clipped Jack Grealish inside the box.That should have been the end of Villa's hopes, but they were gifted a way back into the game just after the hour mark.Bernardo Silva's error allowed Ollie Watkins space to run through and he beat Ederson with a cool finish.City still had the cushion of a two-goal lead but continued to be sloppy when they played out from the back and were grateful to see a long-range effort from Philippe Coutinho deflected just over, while Jhon Duran hit the bar with a fierce volley in the dying seconds.

They got greater rewards when they pressed higher up the pitch in the second half, bringing loud groans from the home fans whenever they won the ball back.

West Ham suffer Paqueta blowWest Ham 1-1 Chelsea: We made some basic errors - David MoyesWhen these two clubs previously met, at Stamford Bridge last September, Hammers boss David Moyes was left furious by a ""scandalous"" decision to rule out a 90th-minute West Ham equaliser.Once again they had another late goal chalked off as Soucek's finish was disallowed but there were were few complaints from the Hammers bench this time as replays showed it was clearly offside.Instead, it was Chelsea who were aggrieved at the end after appeals for a penalty after Soucek's handball were waved away.After a long season of struggle, West Ham are showing signs of fight near the bottom of the table.They head to Tottenham for another London derby on 19 February on the back of a four-match unbeaten run after following up a 1-1 draw at Newcastle with another gritty performance.Whether Brazil midfielder Lucas Paqueta features against Tottenham remains to be seen.

De Zerbi's side were on course to move within two points of fifth-placed Tottenham - who have played two games more and were beaten heavily by Leicester on Saturday - when Solly March opened the scoring from Pervis Estupinan's searching cross.But they remain four points adrift of Spurs after a glaring mistake by Seagulls goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, who dropped a routine catch from Michael Olise's delivery to allow James Tomkins to head home from close range and salvage a point for the hosts.""We lost two points but we know football,"" said De Zerbi. ""We were a little unlucky but I am really proud of the performance, the players, the quality of play and how many chances we had.

""We won't hide behind it, but for sure it was an unfortunate situation. It meant we couldn't make more changes in the second half in an attacking sense.""They're both hamstrings.

This comes from strength inside of you.""To cap off a truly rotten afternoon for Spurs, they lost goalscorer Bentancur to a knee injury suffered as he tackled Mendy after an hour.The Foxes are now 13th, six points above the relegation zone, while Tottenham remain fifth.Follow live text commentary Saturday's Premier League games How did you rate Leicester's performance?

""Some of our football was outstanding. We looked back to being really dangerous again. We could have had a couple more goals. We played with a real bravery.""With Maddison well and truly back from injury, and several new signings, plus Iheanacho scoring for a third game in a row, Rodgers will be delighted.It had looked set to be a bad afternoon when Kristensen diverted a corner into the path of Bentancur for the opener.The Denmark Under-21 defender had a bright game, that one moment aside, clearing a ball off the line moments before that goal and popping up in both boxes with tackles and passes.But then Mendy produced his unbelievable strike, his first in English football, as he ran on to Bentancur's clearance to leather a shot past Fraser Forster.Faes had already been booked for tackling Kane so he was taking a risk when he challenged the same player in the centre circle. But the loose ball flew about 30 yards to Iheanacho to set up Maddison for his second goal in two games.Iheanacho put them in control before the break from Harry Souttar's ball - and they had chances in the second half before two clever Barnes finishes, one that did not stand and then the one that did.This must now be considered the most entertaining Premier League match-up of recent seasons. Since Leicester's promotion in 2014, their games against Spurs have produced 76 goals, the most of any fixture in the division over that time.To improve the party atmosphere even more, Rodgers was able to bring on right-back Ricardo Pereira for his first appearance of the season following an Achilles injury.Visit our Leicester City pageGo straight to all the best Tottenham contentFalse dawn for Spurs?Leicester 4-1 Tottenham: Cristian Stellini - Spurs have to apologise, not good enoughTottenham had appeared to turn a corner after a team meeting following their 4-2 loss at Manchester City a month ago.Wins over Fulham, Preston and champions City came afterwards.Conte missed that City win as he recovered in Italy and he probably wishes he was still at home after witnessing this capitulation up close.First-choice goalkeeper Hugo Lloris missed the first of many games here, with the club captain ruled out for at least six weeks with a knee injury.Veteran Forster started in goal, only his second league game since joining Spurs in the summer.It was all looking so good when Bentancur scored - although they had to wait two minutes to celebrate after a long VAR check for offside.But that was one of just four shots on target all afternoon.Kane, their all-time top scorer, had to wait until the 90th minute for his only shot of the game. Son Heung-min, who scored a hat-trick in the reverse fixture, only had one effort himself.Pedro Porro, their new signing at right-back, had a disappointing debut as he struggled with Barnes' pace.Bentancur added to an already long injury list when he was hurt in a collision with Mendy and needed oxygen - although he was able to walk off with help instead of needing the stretcher that had been sent on.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64520925
757,Southampton 1-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Defeat increases pressure on Nathan Jones,SAT 11 Feb 2023,premier-league,"Southampton have lost seven of their eight Premier League matches under Nathan JonesTen-man Wolves ramped up the pressure on Southampton manager Nathan Jones as they fought back to claim a dramatic victory over the Premier League's bottom side at St Mary's.January signing Joao Gomes, 21, scored the winner on his debut for Julen Lopetegui's side, an hour after Mario Lemina had been dismissed with a second yellow card for dissent.Carlos Alcaraz had already put the struggling hosts ahead before Lemina's sending-off, but the Saints were unable to extend their lead against stubborn opposition in front of an increasingly anxious home support.Wolves' persistence eventually told after 72 minutes when Jan Bednarek inadvertently bundled the ball over the line after getting in the way of Adama Traore's shot.The mood among the home support worsened as Gomes fired in to complete a remarkable turnaround, before the full-time whistle was greeted with a chorus of boos.The defeat left Southampton four points from safety, while 15th-placed Wolves moved five points clear of the relegation places.

759,Manchester United 2-2 Leeds United: Jadon Sancho goal earns home side point in thriller,WED 08 Feb 2023,premier-league,"Jadon Sancho scored in his first Premier League game since OctoberMarcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho combined to deny manager-less Leeds a rare Old Trafford victory as Manchester United came back from two goals down to snatch a point from a thrilling Roses match.The hosts looked finished when Raphael Varane turned Crysencio Summerville's cutback into his own net to put Leeds two ahead after Wilfried Gnonto had given them a first-minute lead.But Rashford halved the deficit when he headed home Diogo Dalot's inviting cross before Sancho, only just back to first-team duties after recovering from physical and mental issues, scored his first Premier League goal since September when he drove home from 10 yards after Luke Shaw's initial shot had been blocked.Varane brought an excellent save out of Illan Meslier as Manchester United hunted a goal to extend their 13-match winning streak on home soil.Anything less than a point would have been extremely harsh on Leeds, who sacked manager Jesse Marsch on Monday, and they also hit the post through Brenden Aaronson in between the home side's two goals.The result moves them a point clear of the relegation zone and above West Ham into 16th, although after this superb contest, the Elland Road rematch in four days' time will be an occasion to relish.Ten Hag 'proud' of 'magnificent' Sancho on returnReaction to the thrilling draw between Man Utd and LeedsGo straight to all the best Manchester United contentVisit our Leeds United pageLeeds claim a precious pointGnonto scored the opener at Old Trafford after 55 secondsThe general narrative around Elland Road in the wake of Marsch's dismissal has been that the Leeds' hierarchy would use a week that features two games against Manchester United to recruit a replacement before key clashes with relegation rivals Everton and Southampton later this month.Leeds had not won a league game at Old Trafford since 1981 and before kick-off many of their fans were speculating about what their margin of defeat would be, rather than whether they could get something from the game.That assessment reckoned without a super motivated Leeds team, led by former England futsal head coach Michael Skubala and lethargic hosts, who began with a sloppiness seldom seen under Ten Hag since that woeful opening to his tenure that featured defeats to Brighton and Brentford.Italian teenager Gnonto took maximum advantage of the room afforded to him by a failure to track his first-minute surge to the edge of the area by burying his shot in the bottom corner.If he was watching as Varane turned Summerville's cutback into his own net three minutes after the break, Marsch must have wondered why he could not have enjoyed the same slices of fortune.Leeds 'proud' of Man Utd result - SkubalaLeeds are not his responsibility now of course and Skubala's celebrations on the touchline were full of sheer delight, along with those of a coaching team that includes Chris Armas, who spent the second half of last term being derided for his contribution to Ralf Rangnick's Manchester United staff.Football management is not so easy though and Skubala went through a full range of emotions as Manchester United fought back, appealing for every throw and free-kick, no matter how obviously it was that they were not his team's.However, with the backing of their noisy support, Leeds made it to the final whistle, lifting some of the pressure off the players and placing the focus back on sporting director Victor Orta, who returned from a trip to Madrid talking to potential managers to see for himself the battling spirit that remains in this group of players.""I've been really busy just looking after this job for the last few days,"" said Skubala, adding he did not know whether he would be in charge at the weekend. ""That's up to other people to decide but it's a great opportunity for the players and the staff.""If I'm called upon then I just want to help the club in the best way I can.""Man United 2-2 Leeds United: Erik ten Hag criticises Man Utd's 'unacceptable' startSancho's welcome returnLeeds' supporters paired Rashford and Sancho in a 'you let your country down' song.The pair's careers have moved in different directions since that Euro 2020 penalty shootout loss to Italy. Rashford has now scored 20 goals in all competitions - and 12 since the World Cup, when he excelled.Sancho's likely omission from Gareth Southgate's squad for Qatar was put forward as one of the reasons why his early-season form deteriorated, bringing with it physical and mental issues it took a spell training on his own to overcome.The former Borussia Dortmund winger's celebration as he ran away had an element of relief to it.At a time when Manchester United are without the creativity of Christian Eriksen, the unpredictability of Antony and game management skills of Casemiro, Sancho's quality is something Ten Hag really needs right now.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62866736

We're thinking about how we get better,"" Cooper told Sky Sports.""We're building an identity, we're building a team.

Have your say hereWhat did you make of Leeds' display? Send us your views hereThe hosts were indebted to debutant goalkeeper Keylor Navas, on loan from Paris St-Germain, who made important first-half saves from Wilfried Gnonto, Luke Ayling and Luis Sinisterra, who put Leeds' best chance of the game over the bar from six yards out.Leeds' threat all but vanished in the second period and Forest comfortably held on for a third victory in five Premier League games, moving up to the 13th in the table.""The first half for us was just about the individual moments of Keylor's saves and Brennan's finish,"" Cooper told BBC Match of the Day.""We're obviously really happy with the win. I'm not really happy with the performance and that's my job to look into that. I don't think it would be elite enough just to think about the win. So there's work to do but we know that.""Jesse Marsch's Leeds, meanwhile, have gone seven league games without a win and stay 17th, above the relegation zone only on goal difference.Navas shows his class on Premier League debutOf Forest's 29 signings since the start of last summer, Navas - a three-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid - was perhaps the biggest name.He quickly showed why he is so highly rated, racing off his line and getting down sharply to deny Sinisterra inside the first two minutes.Forest struggled to getting going at all in the first half with ventures into the Leeds half few and far between, and while the visitors by no means laid siege to Navas' goal, the Costa Rican was there to make a number of crucial interventions when called upon.Ayling and Gnonto had goalbound efforts repelled with the former also seeing his header back across goal clawed away by Navas ahead of the waiting Patrick Bamford.Keylor Navas made a number of important saves on his Nottingham Forest debutWith Cooper's side much improved after the break, Navas had a much quieter 45 minutes - but had already proved his worth.""Everyone knows what he's done in the game and how experienced he is, but he still wanted to show who he is today,"" Cooper added.""We've had a great few days with him. He's showed fantastic humility - he's really trying to buy in to how we play and the surroundings of the club so I've only got positive things to say at the moment.""We're delighted in the dressing room and he's quite composed in the corner thinking: 'I've done that before.'""A reliable goalscorer is often touted as crucial in a relegation scrap - Johnson is beginning to step up to that role - but a goalkeeper to bail you out when you're not at your best is priceless.Even at 36, Navas looks perfectly equipped to be that man for Forest.Leeds rue missed chances - again - before fadingAnother dispiriting result leaves Leeds without a Premier League since 5 November.Even taking into account the break for the World Cup, it is a statistic that makes for grim reading for their supporters.Given the way Marsch's side started at the City Ground, it could so easily have been the day they snapped that winless streak.They were bright, popping the ball around quickly and creating openings with the impressive Gnonto central to their threat.However, they were let down by an all-too-familiar failing as a number of presentable chances were passed up.Gnonto squared for Sinisterra, who leaned back and blazed his shot over the bar. The Italian winger then cut the ball back for Bamford, who fluffed the shot; Ayling kept it alive but put his shot too close to the goalkeeper.Then Gnonto himself had a chance, pouncing on an error by Neco Williams, but his near-post effort was pushed away.As well as Navas played, more than once Leeds really should not have given him a chance.""We are struggling to turn performances into results and we've been in this place for a while,"" Marsch told BBC Sport.""It's hard for me to accept and it's frustrating. And I've got to find ways to change that feeling and find ways to get the results we think we deserve.""In general we are struggling to get the results we feel like we deserve.""The work and commitment on the inside has been good but from a result perspective it puts stress on the environment. I have to take responsibility on that and I do.""Perhaps even more worrying for Leeds was a second half in which they not only failed to create any clear chances but rarely even got themselves in a position to do so.Marsch was backed in the transfer window and with pressure on him building, he must hope his new recruits - one of whom, Weston McKennie, made his debut off the bench - can help change his side's fortunes quickly.Visit our Nottingham Forest pageGo straight to all the best Leeds content",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64442954

His goal was instinctive and he also created an opening in the first half with a neat turn into space.The absence of Wilfried Zaha with a hamstring injury was not a major blow in that sense and it took a brilliant David de Gea save to deny skipper Marc Guehi and concede the corner from which Palace scored.However, while they are unquestionably a better side to watch than in Roy Hodgson's day, they are also easier to score against.They have only five top-flight clean sheets all season and the room Rashford was afforded for what turned out to be the winner was poor considering how close he was to goal.

772,Manchester City 3-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Erling Haaland scores hat-trick,SUN 22 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Erling Haaland's 31 goals this season include 25 in 20 Premier League gamesErling Haaland scored his fourth Manchester City hat-trick and took his goal tally for the season to 31 in all competitions as relegation-threated Wolves were swept aside by Pep Guardiola's men.By his own incredibly high standards, Haaland had been going through a barren spell.But after ending a three-game drought against Tottenham on Thursday, the Norwegian demolished Wolves in a 12-minute spell either side of half-time.Haaland initially rose to head home Kevin de Bruyne's cross to put the hosts ahead at the break.He then drove home a penalty after Ilkay Gundogan had been fouled by Wolves skipper Ruben Neves, before sweeping home his third after Jose Sa's pass out of his six-yard box went straight to Riyad Mahrez.Man City have had to adapt for Haaland - GuardiolaHaaland's hat-trick landmarksPep Guardiola says his side played a 'fantastic game'Haaland has now scored 25 goals in City's first 20 Premier League games. That is five more than Luis Suarez managed in 2013-14, the previous highest figure at this stage in the season.The Norwegian striker's current total would have been enough to earn him the Golden Boot in more than half of the 30 campaigns since the English top flight was renamed in 1992.He has also already scored as many Premier League hat-tricks as Mo Salah, and a third of Sergio Aguero's record 12, which the Argentine achieved across his magnificent decade with City.Only Alan Shearer has scored more Premier League hat-tricks in a single season, with five.How did you rate Manchester City's performance? Have your say hereWhat did you make of Wolves' display? Send us your views hereHaaland driving City onWhen Guardiola came out with his extraordinary rant after the win over Tottenham, he spoke about the difficulty of maintaining drive and determination when you are so used to winning.That is why Haaland is so important to this team.The Norwegian's last league title was three years ago in Austria. His last trophy was the German Cup with Borussia Dortmund in 2021.If the idea of a fifth championship in six seasons fails to motivate some City players, Haaland is not among them, and his thirst for goals could be a telling factor as the second half of this season unfolds.Guardiola saw no point in pushing the striker, and replaced him with World Cup winner Julian Alvarez after an hour.More good news for City is that Jack Grealish also seems to be finding more consistency.His teasing advances from the left are more reminiscent of his Aston Villa days and would have brought him a first-half goal had Sa not made one superb save and Nathan Collins not been in the right place at the right time to head another effort off the line.Mahrez had an effort ruled out for offside, after which City cruised home and Haaland was able to take the acclaim of the home fans at the end.Lopetegui's Wolves stallManchester City 3-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Lopetegui rues poor first half performanceThis was the first significant setback for Julen Lopetegui since he replaced Bruno Lage as Wolves boss during the World Cup.If there is comfort for the former Spain and Real Madrid coach, it comes from the knowledge there are not many more demanding tests than this, even if his side only remain outside the relegation zone on goal difference.The arrival of Craig Dawson for £3.3m from West Ham should help shore up a hesitant defence, while a first start for Mario Lemina here, plus a debut for Pablo Sarabia, further creates a team Lopetegui can work with - especially if his other transfer window target, Flamengo's Joao Gomes, can be kept out of Lyon's clutches.He clearly wants more width from Wolves' passing, although he does have a week to work on that, with his side not involved in the FA Cup fourth round next weekend.February will then be a crucial month, with Wolves taking on two sides presently below them, Southampton and Bournemouth, in successive weeks.Certainly no-one could accuse Lopetegui of not being invested in his job. He was booked along with Neves for arguing over an incident when City's Rico Lewis appeared to bring down Hwang Hee-chan, when the South Korean was about to set off on a long run towards to City goal before Haaland changed the direction of the contest.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64279779
773,Arsenal 3-2 Manchester United: Late goal by Eddie Nketiah gives Arsenal win over United,SUN 22 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Eddie Nketiah scored Arsenal's equaliser in the first half after Manchester United had taken the lead through Marcus RashfordArsenal retained control of the Premier League title race after Eddie Nketiah's 90th-minute winner gave them a dramatic victory over Manchester United in a thriller at Emirates Stadium. Manchester City's earlier win over Wolverhampton Wanderers applied pressure on the Gunners but they responded with character and quality, even after going behind, to secure a five-point advantage at the top with a game in hand. United's man of the moment Marcus Rashford fired home a superb right-foot strike from 25 yards to give them a 17th-minute lead. Arsenal responded fiercely and were level seven minutes later when Granit Xhaka's cross created a heading opportunity for Nketiah, who got in ahead of Aaron Wan-Bissaka at the far post. Bukayo Saka's angled drive put Arsenal ahead eight minutes after the break but their advantage lasted only six minutes, with Lisandro Martinez heading his first goal for the club after keeper Aaron Ramsdale dropped a corner. Arsenal looked the more likely winners in the closing stages, with Saka hitting the post and Nketiah denied by David de Gea's outstanding save.The pressure paid off in the closing moments when Nketiah - a striker who is doing an outstanding job filling in for injured Gabriel Jesus - turned in from close range to spark wild scenes of celebration at Emirates Stadium.

A draw would hardly have been disastrous for Arsenal coming against Erik ten Hag's improving Manchester United - but the whole mood was lifted sky high by Nketiah's last-gasp intervention. Aware Manchester City were on their shoulders after beating Wolves, Arsenal's nerve was further tested when Rashford's golden run continued and he put United ahead. Arsenal responded with the intensity and quality that has marked their game on their route to the top of the table - ordered and composed; still creating opportunities until Nketiah settled matters. Saka and captain Martin Odegaard are creating chances and threat, while Nketiah is ensuring the absence of Gabriel Jesus - which many feared would seriously sabotage the Gunners' title challenge - is not stopping them winning matches.

So it was understandable that they looked so devastated when the brief hope offered by a VAR check on Nketiah's winner was extinguished and they simply did not have enough time to salvage a point. Arsenal deserved the win and United may look back on the expensive absence of the suspended Casemiro, who would have provided vital experience and game management in those frantic closing stages, and the fact that giant striker Wout Weghorst is still adjusting to life back in the Premier League. There was still plenty to admire in United, who gave as good as they got for the first hour and fought back strongly after Saka put Arsenal in front. In the end, United were left bitterly disappointment by the defeat, with a heavy recent programme leaving them looking weary-legged near the end. Arsenal fully merited the victory but there is no doubt tenacious United are heading in the right direction. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64279776

Chelsea had an early Kai Havertz strike ruled out for offside by VAR and there was also a lively debut as a second-half substitute for £89m new boy Mykhailo Mudryk, while Liverpool keeper Alisson saved well from another new Chelsea signing, defender Benoit Badiashile. Liverpool's own £45m recruit Cody Gakpo was quiet - he did force one save from Kepa, but otherwise there was little to warm a capacity crowd at a freezing Anfield.

Have your say hereWhat did you make of Chelsea's display? Send us your comments hereLiverpool lack intensity Liverpool made little step forward - KloppThe quality of this game was reflected in the subdued atmosphere at Anfield, with the final whistle greeted with near silence apart from some very mild applause. Liverpool have made their reputation and based their success under manager Jurgen Klopp not simply on world-class talent but on a searing intensity that has seen teams simply blown away. They currently look a shadow of that side in every respect - admittedly deprived of attacking talent such as Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino - and there were very few alarms for Chelsea and no serious work for keeper Kepa.""We had good spells but couldn't keep it up,"" Klopp told BT Sport.""We have to be ready for little steps and this is a little step. A clean sheet against Chelsea, we didn't create a lot of chances and they had some as well.""In the end, I'm OK with 0-0 because you have to accept these steps. We can build on that.""Liverpool's new signing Gakpo seems to be in a settling-in period, which is perfectly understandable, and he struggled to make an impact apart from one shot on the turn that brought a comfortable save from Kepa in front of The Kop. Klopp's side are now nine points off the Champions League places and it is clear they need to find that missing spark - and quickly - if they are to get anywhere near the top four.Chelsea happier with draw Liverpool 0-0 Chelsea: Graham Potter says side improving after 'good point'Chelsea's new manager Graham Potter has had a tough start to life at Stamford Bridge, with poor results coming as the club continue to embark on a remarkable transfer spree. And this is why Potter and Chelsea will take this point, even though they will know they had chances to make it three against a Liverpool defence that continues to look vulnerable, especially without Virgil van Dijk.""I thought the performance was good,"" Potter told BT Sport. ""Happy with the team, the energy, what we tried to do. At Anfield, it is always tough. It is a clean sheet and a point, we move forward.""Overall, a positive day, apart from the fact we wanted three points.""There was a big bright spot for Chelsea in the cameo from Mudryk, newly arrived from Shakhtar Donetsk but very quick - literally - to adjust to life in the Premier League when he was introduced after 55 minutes. He provoked panic instantly in the veteran James Milner, who was clearly unable to cope with his pace and received a yellow card for a desperate foul before he was substituted. Mudryk had a weaving run into the penalty area which ended with a shot into the side-netting and he was unlucky on two occasions when he stole in unnoticed at the far post. Potter added: ""He's not played football for a while, he's been on a mid-season break. We had to manage his minutes, but you can see his quality.""New defender Badiashile also created a good impression although he should have scored with a first-half header that was saved by Liverpool keeper Alisson. Chelsea will regret not taking some of the opportunities they had when Liverpool's defence was stretched, but this is a time when they will accept small mercies and a point at Anfield - even with their opponents in their current reduced state - is always acceptable.

March tried to beat goalkeeper Danny Ward at the front post but was blocked, with Ward later saving with his knee from Alexis Mac Allister's shot from range.But Ferguson, who replaced Danny Welbeck on 66 minutes, was alert to Estupinan's fizzed cross to keep his side well in contention for a European spot, an ambition manager Roberto de Zerbi made clear last week after seeing his side thrash Liverpool 3-0.The Italian coach did however find himself in the book for his reaction after Brighton had a penalty claim waved away by both the referee and VAR.""I think we deserved to win,"" De Zerbi told BBC Match of the Day. ""I think we played well. I saw the stats and it's incredible for us.""Mitoma scored a fantastic goal and Ferguson is an 18-year-old, Danny Welbeck played a good game.

Watkins' fifth goal of the season ultimately proved decisive, as Saints' three-match winning run in all competitions came to an abrupt end.""I'm so happy with his work and how he is helping the team,"" Emery said of the former Brentford forward.

""We are winning some matches but there's more in my mind I want to do.""A lot of teams are trying to sign players to improve and stay in the Premier League.

Jones' half-time switch from 4-2-3-1 to 3-5-2 appeared to give his players renewed energy, Martinez denying Adam Armstrong before Ward-Prowse scored what he thought was his fifth league goal since the World Cup - only for it to be ruled out for Elyounoussi's challenge on Ramsey.Asked by BBC Match of the Day about the decision to disallow Ward-Prowse's effort, Jones said: ""It was a goal that was overturned softly. I'm just really, really frustrated because I feel we deserved something from the game.""We showed real naivety on the set play [for Watkins' goal]. The only way we are conceding is either [through] a counter-attack or set play.""If we keep those out then we've got a good side.""Djenepo's fierce strike almost salvaged a point late on, but Jones must now find a way to lift his players for Tuesday's Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at home to high-flying Newcastle.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64272710

Danny Ings' introduction for his debut 20 minutes from time must have been particularly painful for Lampard as the striker was someone he was trying to attract to Goodison Park before he moved to West Ham for an initial £12m on Friday.Indeed, it was West Ham who came closest to adding to their lead as Pickford turned Emerson's shot on to the bar, and Rice rolled an effort marginally wide of the far post.Moshiri was sat on the same row as chairman Bill Kenwright, chief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale and between football director Kevin Thelwell and director Graeme Sharp.Kenwright was shown on his own near the end, but it is Moshiri who must now decide whether Lampard will remain in his job, the former West Ham player taunted with a ""sacked in the morning"" jibe from the home fans.Watch: Lampard's last interview as Everton managerWest Ham say farewell to David GoldThe result was at least fitting on the day West Ham paid tribute to joint chairman David Gold, who died on 4 January.Born in the shadow of Upton Park, a lifelong fan of the club and a player in his schooldays, Gold was viewed as the least problematic of an ownership group many fans do not like.The stadium was full and paid a respectful tribute to Gold before the game, with sporting director Mark Noble laying a wreath on behalf of the club before kick-off, flanked by Gold's daughters, Jacqueline and Vanessa.A video of Gold's journey from childhood poverty - ""I only wanted to own a bike"" - to football club owner was greeted with warm applause.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64272706

Eddie Howe's side are now the first team in more than 20 years - since Liverpool in 2002 - to go 16 Premier League games without conceding in the opening period.Evidence pointed to this being a goalless draw. It was 0-0 between the sides at St James' Park in September and November, that time a Carabao Cup tie the Magpies won on penalties.They had enough chances to win this one, but this is now their third goalless draw in four league games.Joelinton's three first-half efforts saved by Guaita were all fairly tame. The Spaniard also kept out headers from Wilson and substitute Isak, and Botman powered one of his own wide.Miguel Almiron volleyed an early chance into the side-netting, and Dan Burn and Botman were also denied by the Palace keeper.""I'm really pleased with the team today,"" Howe told BBC Sport. ""We were ourselves and we had chances, we just didn't take them.""There were a lot of half-chance moments and presentable opportunities - a lot of moments where we didn't quite get our final ball right.""We have high expectations of ourselves.

780,Manchester City 4-2 Tottenham: Pep Guardiola's side fight back from two goals down to win,THU 19 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Watch Guardiola's rant after win over TottenhamManchester City overpowered Tottenham with a stunning comeback at Etihad Stadium to narrow the gap on Premier League leaders Arsenal to five points. Spurs looked to be doing bitter north London rivals Arsenal a huge favour when they scored twice in the closing moments of the first half to leave Pep Guardiola's side staring at a third successive loss. Dejan Kulusevski gave Spurs the lead seconds before the break after Rodrigo Bentancur robbed Rodri following Ederson's poor clearance, then Emerson Royal headed a second after the City keeper could only push out Harry Kane's shot. Most inside the Etihad Stadium were frustrated but City, inspired by the outstanding Riyad Mahrez, came flying out after the interval to turn the game on its head with three goals in 12 minutes. Julian Alvarez scored from close range after Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris could not claim Mahrez's cross in the 51st minute, then Erling Haaland headed in from close range two minutes later to draw City level. Spurs almost regained the lead when Ivan Perisic's shot was deflected onto the woodwork by Rico Lewis before Mahrez completed City's comeback, winning a challenge before beating Lloris at his near post.France veteran Lloris was at fault once again after his own goal set Arsenal on their way to victory in the derby on Sunday. Mahrez completed a brilliant individual display when he raced clear in stoppage time to lift a clever finish over the keeper for City's fourth.Guardiola critical of Man City fans despite win'Pep lays out demands for Man City to return to top'Go straight to all the best Manchester City contentVisit our Tottenham pageManchester City 4-2 Tottenham: Pep Guardiola says his side are 'too relaxed'City show champion class Manchester City left the pitch at half-time with heads bowed and their jeering supporters frustrated, mainly by what they felt was referee Simon Hooper's failure to punish Spurs for a succession of fouls as well as a two-goal deficit. What followed was a devastating show of power from City, who came out after the break and simply refused to be denied as Spurs were unable to cope with their attacking variety.Mahrez was magnificent, scoring two goals and being involved in the others and he continues his rich vein of form. City have also uncovered another gem in 18-year-old Rico Lewis, who was heavily involved before and after the double strike from Spurs that made Etihad Stadium such an anxious place during the interval. History tells us that City, as they were in that decisive title victory against Aston Villa on the final day of last season and against Crystal Palace here earlier this season, can never be counted out at two goals down and Alvarez's strike so early in the second half had a galvanizing effect on the champions and a demoralising impact on Spurs. Emerson Royal's goal was his first for Tottenham in the Premier League this seasonTime running out for Lloris?A World Cup winner with France in 2018, Lloris has been a fine servant for Spurs since signing from Lyon - but it is looking increasingly like time for change. The 36-year-old has been at Spurs for more than a decade but now looks increasingly fallible, his game increasingly error-ridden and uncertain. Lloris was badly at fault when he fumbled Bukayo Saka's cross into his own net for Arsenal's opening goal in Spurs' north London derby defeat on Sunday, and he blundered again as they subsided against rampant City.  He did not show enough conviction when trying to claim Mahrez's cross for City's first goal - the ball dropping for Alvarez to score - then he was badly beaten at his near post as Spurs went behind for the first time in the game. Mahrez's shot carried power but Lloris had to do better. Spurs have been linked with Brentford keeper David Raya and Everton's Jordan Pickford, which comes as no surprise as this position looks increasingly like a problem manager Antonio Conte will have to address as a matter of urgency.

We have to invest more to get that second goal and then not be in that situation that a lucky moment costs you two points.""We were 1-0 up.

The Gunners took full advantage of Manchester City's loss at Manchester United on Saturday with an impressive show of style in the first half and steel after the break to claim a vital three points. Arsenal were helped by a blunder from hapless Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris when he fumbled Bukayo Saka's cross into his own net after 14 minutes, but it was no more than Mikel Arteta's side deserved as captain Martin Odegaard drilled in a second from outside the area nine minutes before the break.

The Gunners, as they have so often this season, rose to the challenge by over-running Spurs to take control in the opening 45 minutes, then hold their nerve in the face of an expected rally from Antonio Conte's men after the break.Arsenal were simply irresistible in the first half as they outclassed Spurs - the own goal from Lloris and captain Odegaard's strike scant reward for their vast superiority. Odegaard was class personified in midfield, while Saka ran Spurs ragged down Arsenal's right flank, creating the first goal and posing constant problems. And the visitors showed they were prepared to do the dirty work when Spurs tried to mount a recovery. Keeper Ramsdale was outstanding and his defenders prepared to throw themselves in front of everything to protect the lead. There was some ill-feeling and ugly scenes at the end when Ramsdale and Richarlison had a flare-up, before a Spurs fan appeared to aim a kick at the England keeper.Arsenal's players were eventually dragged away to enjoy their thoroughly-deserved celebrations with their own ecstatic supporters.Spurs fall short againArsenal 'deserve' to be top of Premier League - Antonio ConteSpurs may have created chances and moments of anxiety for Arsenal, especially in the second half, but this was a sobering game for Conte and his players as they looked well off the pace until it was too late. They were trailing once again at half time for the ninth time this season, the seventh in the Premier League, after a first period in which their mediocrity was a sharp contrast to the excellence of their rivals.Spurs have made a habit of slow starts and occasionally been able to dig themselves out of the hole, but they left themselves too much to do against this super-confident Arsenal outfit.Kane was attempting to equal Jimmy Greaves' record of 266 goals for Spurs, but found Ramsdale at his best. At the other end, though, Lloris produced yet another of those errors that happen far too often to a goalkeeper of his reputation.Saka's cross took a deflection of Sessegnon but the French keeper had to do so much better than just let the ball drop behind him into his own net.

March's low shot was brilliantly cleared to safety by Alexander-Arnold, before Mitoma fired past the far post after breaching the Liverpool defence.While Brighton's opener came from a Liverpool error, there was nothing fortunate about the home side's second as March finished magnificently after being played in by teenager Ferguson, who delivered the latest in a string of eye-catching performances.Brighton have now scored in each of their last eight games in the top flight, netting 21 goals in that run.""It's one of the best performances I can remember for a long time,"" March told BBC Sport.

787,Everton 1-2 Southampton: Bottom-of-the-table Saints win to increase pressure on Frank Lampard,SAT 14 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Both of James Ward-Prowse's goals came in the second halfJames Ward-Prowse scored a stunning free-kick as Southampton came from behind to win and increase the pressure on Frank Lampard and Everton.A season of frustration has seen the Toffees once again struggling at the wrong end of the table, and the discontent among the fans was clear at Goodison Park with banners displayed in protest at the club's owners. Indeed, there was enough concern at the club for the safety of their board members that they were told to stay away from the ground.The fans, though, were clearly behind their players, welcoming them to the ground with an incredible scene of blue flares and passionate chanting.That support was rewarded just before half-time when, after a half low on quality from both sides, Everton took the lead when Amadou Onana headed home Demarai Gray's superb cross.But Southampton, who shocked Manchester City in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, turned it around in the second half thanks to Ward-Prowse.He slotted in the equaliser after great footwork inside the box and, after Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin hit the crossbar, Ward-Prowse secured a huge three points for the Saints with a free-kick late on that left Jordan Pickford stranded. Southampton stay bottom of the table but are level with Everton and West Ham on 15 points and are just one point from safety.Day of hope ends in despair for Lampard and EvertonFans show discontent, but what now for Lampard?Everton 1-2 Southampton: Toffees boss Frank Lampard on 'difficult and disappointing' defeatJust nine months ago there was a party atmosphere at Goodison Park as they celebrated their Premier League survival with a thrilling 3-2 win against Crystal Palace.That day Lampard was the hero after guiding the club to safety but fast forward to now and the pressure has been mounting on the Everton boss following a terrible run form.Earlier this week, Everton owner Farhad Moshiri said he had faith in Lampard and the club's directors amid the unrest among some supporters.Everton majority owner Farhad Moshiri has had a significant stake in the club since 2016The team have managed just one win in their past 13 games in all competitions. A win would have significantly relieved that pressure as they could have leapt up to 14th, but as it is they remain deep in trouble near the foot of the table.The players clearly care and showed fight and determination, particularly in the first half, and they did have chances to get a second themselves, notably through Alex Iwobi and Calvert-Lewin. But as the game wore on desperation set in and the lack of quality told. After full-time a sit-in protest was held by a number of supporters as they once again showed their frustration at the board.Saints on the up'It's a big, big week for the club' - JonesA week ago, Southampton's situation looked more dire than Everton's. They had slumped to the bottom of the table and had experienced no new manager bounce under Nathan Jones.But this has been a huge few days for the club as they built on their victory against Manchester City to secure a win that gives them real hope of moving out of the relegation zone.Brazilian defender Lyanco was a key player in the win against City and he was solid once again in this game to frustrate Everton and while they did not show masses of quality themselves, Ward-Prowse is a deadly set-piece taker capable of winning any match, as it proved at Goodison Park.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64195234

""So we wanted to give something back to the fans.""They were deserved winners here thanks to a much-improved second half display after a drab opening 45 minutes, with Johnson and Gibbs-White at the heart of all their good play.Their opener arrived when Gibbs-White found himself in space in the centre circle and threaded the ball through to Johnson, who initially saw his celebrations cut short by the off-side flag before the goal was given by the Video Assistant Referee.Gibbs-White's assist for the second was even better, with his pass with the outside of his right foot finding Johnson, whose fine first touch took the ball away from a chasing defender and allowed him to power it into the far corner.""I'm really pleased Brennan has scored from open play,"" added Cooper. ""It's been coming, he has been working so hard and took his goals really well. He deserves that and the team deserve it. It capped off a really good day.""It caps a memorable few days for Forest after their penalty shootout win against Wolves sent them through to the EFL Cup semi-finals.The only concern was a muscle injury to goalkeeper Dean Henderson late on as he took a goal-kick, with Cooper later revealing it ""doesn't look good"".Forest had used all their substitutes so could not bring on a replacement, but Henderson was able to continue as they saw out the game.Foxes post-match slump continuesFoxes have not been good enough - RodgersThe jubilant scenes among the Forest supporters were in sharp contrast to the furious reaction of the visiting fans at the final whistle, who made their displeasure at the performance clear.After reviving their season with a run of five wins from six before the World Cup, Leicester's form has collapsed since the resumption and they have dropped perilously close to the bottom three to pile the pressure on manager Brendan Rodgers.In a game of few chances, the Foxes will rue that early miss by Barnes, who also spurned another fine opportunity at the start of the second when he was played in by Youri Tielemans.But after falling behind shortly after, what little attacking threat Leicester had fizzled away and they rarely looked like getting back into the game, managing just one shot on target throughout the whole 90 minutes.""In the second half we weren't good, I thought in the first half we were the better team but didn't take our chances,"" Rodgers told BBC Match of the Day.""In fairness to Brennan Johnson, he finished his chances really well. He scored his two chances and we weren't able to. ""We are doing our very best but we have just not been good enough. We have to do our best and we will keep fighting.""On a personal level, I know the game. I came in to do my very best and that's all I will ever do.

789,Wolves 1-0 West Ham: Daniel Podence winner adds to pressure on David Moyes,SAT 14 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Wolves' four Premier League wins this season have all come by a single goalWolves climbed out of the relegation zone for the first time in three months and dumped West Ham in the bottom three to increase the pressure on manager David Moyes.Daniel Podence scored the only goal when he drove home Matheus Nunes' cross three minutes after half-time.Despite a summer outlay of £160m, West Ham have collected a single point from their past seven games before a meeting with Moyes' old club and fellow underachievers Everton at London Stadium next Saturday.'You have to win games, I'm not stupid' - MoyesMoyes went to applaud the visiting supporters at the end but the reaction from many was negative.In contrast, Wolves manager Julen Lopetegui punched the air in delight at the final whistle.The former Real Madrid and Spain boss is now responsible for half of Wolves' four league wins this season and would have secured Wolves' most convincing victory had Raul Jimenez's stoppage-time effort not been ruled out for offside.Julen Lopetegui praises Wolves 'character and commitment'Moyes' men badly underperformingIn defending his record at West Ham, Moyes quite rightly points to the previous two and a half seasons before this one, when he saved the club from relegation, then secured European qualification through their league position in successive seasons for the first time in their history.The problem for Moyes is that many of the little things West Ham have been doing right for the past couple of years are not quite working for them this season.Jarrod Bowen last season and Thomas Soucek the year before were outstanding performers. Currently, they are ineffective from an attacking perspective.Bowen surged to the byline towards the end of the first half and Soucek made a trademark burst into the box, but the end product of the industry was an easy catch for Wolves keeper Jose Sa.By the end of October last season, Michail Antonio had scored seven goals for West Ham. He has scored 11 in 62 games since. Although he tried to unsettle Wolves' central defensive pair of Nathan Collins and Maximilian Kilman, he never managed it.Said Benrahma did bring a low save out of Sa but even with fellow substitute Gianluca Scamacca joining Antonio in the two-man frontline many Hammers fans have been calling for, it was not until the final five minutes that West Ham built up any attacking momentum.Scamacca headed a far-post opportunity wide but there appeared to be a lack of belief among the West Ham players which was certainly shared by many fans at the end.West Ham 'deserved something from the game' - David MoyesWolves on the march under LopeteguiLopetegui would not have put his reputation on the line in a Premier League relegation battle without the promise of some firepower being added to his existing squad.Two new signings were involved on Saturday, with the promise of a third arriving in the form of PSG winger Pablo Sarabia.Wolves on verge of Sarabia dealThe late introduction of Mario Lemina for his debut brought stability to Wolves in central midfield, but by then Lopetegui's first transfer window recruit, Atletico Madrid forward Matheus Cunha, had already made an outstanding contribution.Cunha may not have scored but Wolves have been crying out for an effective forward with the Brazilian's pace.By moving into wide areas, Cunha allowed the talented Wolves midfielders to take up positions of danger centrally. Skipper Ruben Neves threatened on a couple of occasions before the interval and also struck the bar after it, by which time Wolves were on top.Lopetegui will clearly keep pushing, on and off the pitch but, after such a miserable few months, Molineux is alive with optimism again.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64195237
790,Brentford 2-0 Bournemouth: Pressure increases on Gary O'Neil after sixth straight loss,SAT 14 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Only Yaya Toure (11/11) has a better 100% penalty record in the Premier League than Ivan Toney (nine from nine)A clinical Brentford display heaped more pressure on Bournemouth boss Gary O'Neil and extended their own impressive recent form in the Premier League.Talisman Ivan Toney stepped up and slotted past Neto after being pulled down by Marcos Senesi to maintain his 100% record from the spot from his nine Premier League penalties.It took him to 13 for the season in the league, beating his tally from last season. Chances were few and far between but Brentford - who are now unbeaten in seven Premier League games, and climb above Liverpool into eighth - sealed the win when Mathias Jensen slotted Joshua Dasilva's cross into the top corner. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day, O'Neil said: ""I thought the penalty decision was scandalous, I don't know how you get that wrong with VAR. Crazy for me.""It's a foul as clear as day, Ivan Toney locks his arm in and pulls Marcos Senesi down. It's never a penalty.""We need to work hard, there are little things that can go your way or not. We've suffered some injuries, we're weaker than we'd like to be. We've got to keep working.""Bournemouth, who are 17th and one point clear of the relegation zone, have now lost six games in a row since O'Neil was appointed permanent manager during the World Cup. They have only won two of their past 13 in all competitions and one of their past 10 in the league.Those results have seen pressure build on O'Neil, who started the weekend as third favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked, behind Everton's Frank Lampard and Chelsea's Graham Potter. Despite that, O'Neil said: ""I'm not interested. I'm working as always to win the next game.""Follow reaction as Brentford beat BournemouthVisit our Brentford pageGo straight to all the best AFC Bournemouth contentToney delivers for Brentford Brentford 2-0 Bournemouth: Frank 'very pleased' with consecutive winsThis was the first time Toney had played in 2023 after suffering a knee injury in their victory over West Ham that concluded 2022.His run in behind won the penalty with Senasi wrapping his arm under Toney's, which the Brentford striker then effectively trapped, before falling backwards onto the floor.Jarrod Gillett had little hesitation in awarding the spot-kick, and Toney took two steps forward before side-footing the ball into the side netting, just above the reach of Neto.It means he has scored four goals in his last five Premier League games, and Brentford will be hoping any ban that may come from a Football Association charge for alleged breaches of betting rules is not too substantial as they potentially push for a place in Europe.Overall, it was a relatively flat Brentford performance, until Dasilva burst forward and crossed for Jensen to curl home, with the win meaning the Bees have claimed 19 points from 30 available at home this season.Asked about potentially qualifying for Europe, Brentford boss Thomas Frank told Sky Sports: ""It is important we have dreams. Everyone needs dreams and ambitions.""[Manchester United manager] Erik ten Hag said something about Alex Ferguson, who said the season starts in April. If we think too far ahead we will have a problem. ""It is important to celebrate our wins but after we have to work very hard and see where we will end.""Bournemouth lack edge againBournemouth attempted a season-high 19 open-play crosses but only three were successfulThere is an uncertainty about the managerial situation at Bournemouth and that won't put O'Neil at ease, especially with the club now on their longest winless run since 1983. Since O'Neil's appointment, the American businessman Bill Foley has taken over the club, and fans are yet to see how patient he is.Investment in the playing squad was seemingly guaranteed when he took over, with Foley insisting the Cherries ""will not be relegated"" this season. 'A scandalous decision' - Gary O'Neil on Brentford penaltyThey are yet to make any signings in the January transfer window and saw relegation rivals Wolves, Southampton and Nottingham Forest all win on Saturday. This was another performance of endeavour, suggesting the players are still behind O'Neil but they lacked a spark in the attacking areas, with Siriki Dembele's driven effort just one of two shots on target. Doubts will be creeping in on the south coast. The investment needs to arrive soon if Foley's bold claim is going to be true come May. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64195233

It is a really positive sign for me. It hurts to lose but a really positive performance.""I've tried hard to create a process and understanding of how we want to play football.

I want us to stay laser focused on us,"" he said.Bailey had a hand in both goals with the Jamaican winger finishing off a counter-attack after a great run by Boubacar Kamara in just the third minute to put the hosts ahead.That was Villa's only shot in the first half, with Leeds having two penalty appeals rejected, a Rodrigo goal disallowed for offside and missing big chances.Villa debutant Alex Moreno denied Rodrigo with a goalline clearance and keeper Emiliano Martinez pulled off a wonderful reaction stop to deny Jack Harrison from close range.Unai Emery's hosts were better in the second half and they got the goal to make them more comfortable - thanks to the video assistant referee.Bailey's shot was saved by Illan Meslier with Buendia heading the rebound over the grounded goalkeeper.The goal was ruled out for offside but the VAR told referee Michael Oliver that Buendia was clearly onside - and it was given.Leeds were given hope in the final 10 minutes though when Wilfried Gnonto cut the ball back for Bamford, making his return after two and a half months out with a groin injury, to slam home.But they could not find an equaliser and remain only two points above the relegation zone, with Villa eight points further up the table in 11th.It was not a perfect night for Villa, who lost left-back Lucas Digne and striker Ollie Watkins to injury in the first half.Follow reaction to the game hereHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance?

The reigning champions struggled in the first half before two of manager Pep Guardiola's substitutes combined to break the deadlock after 63 minutes, Riyad Mahrez turning in Jack Grealish's low cross at the far post. Chelsea enjoyed the better of the first half despite adding both former City forward Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic to a lengthening injury list, substitute Carney Chukwuemeka hitting the post from the edge of the area.Graham Potter will justifiably point to Chelsea's ill-luck with absentees but the bottom line is this defeat leaves them in the unaccustomed position of 10th, 10 points off the Champions League places.

Guardiola's side struggled in the first half with three in central defence but the manager reverted to four in the second half in what was an ominous show of strength from his substitutes' bench. And it worked to settle this tight encounter as Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga failed to cut out Grealish's cross and Mahrez got in ahead of Marc Cucurella to make the decisive contribution. John Stones was singled out for special acclaim by City's travelling fans at the final whistle and rightly so after another outstanding performance, the highlight coming with a superbly-timed tackle on Pulisic in the six-yard box with the game in the balance. City will have better days and nights than this but the main objective here against a tough opponent was a win that would make up for the disappointing home draw against Everton, and this was very much mission accomplished. Chelsea fight but struggles continue Chelsea 0-1 Manchester City: Performance 'a step forward' - PotterChelsea's fans applauded their players off at the final whistle despite this damaging defeat, putting aside their disappointment as they understood the current situation facing manager Potter. This is a club in transition under new owner Todd Boehly, with the Chelsea hierarchy operating a somewhat scattergun transfer policy, and a newly-arrived manager in Potter attempting to put his stamp on this team. Chelsea currently look way off being contenders for a place in the Champions League, surely a minimum requirement given their outlay and ambition on a day when they confirmed another arrival in £35m defender Benoit Badiashile from Monaco. They never lacked heart or effort but were struggling from the moments they lost Sterling and Pulisic to injury, eating further into Potter's squad. Potter's plight was illustrated when he sent on 19-year-old Chukwuemeka for Pulisic and he was joined by young trio Conor Gallagher, Lewis Hall and Omari Hutchinson as they tried to rescue the game after City took the lead. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was the early substitute for Sterling but suffered the ignominy of being substituted late on. He could have no complaints after a poor performance in which he looked a thoroughly spent force. This was more disappointment for Chelsea, who now face an uphill struggle to get anywhere near the clubs they would regard as their traditional Premier League rivals.

Send us your viewsImproving Forest have now lost only two of 10 games in all competitions and moved above West Ham, Everton and Bournemouth from 18th to 15th.Southampton are in their 11th successive top-flight campaign but have now only won once in 13 in the league since beating Chelsea 2-1 on 30 August.At both half-time and at the end, the home fans booed their team off the pitch and Jones could understand why.""The crowd are frustrated, we're bottom of the Premier League and they want to see more quality,"" added the former Luton Town boss. ""Pretty much everything we have to do better.""We have to keep clean sheets, take chances, show more bravery in the final third.""Southampton 0-1 Nottingham Forest: Saints must stop 'gifting' goals says Nathan JonesSouthampton captain James Ward-Prowse urged his side's supporters to be patient and added: ""We as players know and understand their frustrations. They have to bear with us, it's a different squad to one we have had before.""We're in early days with the manager and it's going to take a bit of time. Obviously time is not our friend and we need to turn it around quickly.""'I really challenged the players'Before the match began, it featured the side with the worst home record against the team with the worst away record.Che Adams had a glorious chance to put the hosts ahead after only six minutes but shot wastefully wide from inside the penalty area.That proved costly as Forest, with just two points from their previous eight games on the road, hit the crossbar through the impressive Johnson before he set up Awoniyi 15 minutes later for the opening goal.The first half got even worse for the hosts when centre-back Armel Bella-Kotchap, a member of Germany's World Cup squad although he failed to make an appearance, went off injured after only 34 minutes with Duje Caleta-Car replacing him.The atmosphere was turning with Southampton giving their fans little to cheer for the remainder of the half, with the team booed off at the break.Sekou Mara had a rare chance for the Saints in the second half but headed wide, although it took a deflection and was wrongly given as a goal-kick.Jones made an attacking triple substitution in the 64th minute, with Joe Aribo, Samuel Edozie and Adam Armstrong all coming on, but none of them tested Forest goalkeeper Dean Henderson.Forest then handed a debut to Brazil international midfielder Gustavo Scarpa after he became the club's 24th signing of the campaign when he joined Forest on a free transfer from Palmeiras last month.The visitors were happy to defend deep with Willy Boly, Joe Worrall and Serge Aurier all superb for Forest as they frustrated the hosts.""It's better to be out of the bottom three than in it for sure but it's one step at a time,"" said Forest boss Steve Cooper. ""I really challenged the players to get the first away win and challenged myself and the staff, we're all in it together.""We have had a couple of chances to get out of the bottom three, now we're out, but the objective is not just to stay out but move up the table.""There's a long way to go and tough moments make you stronger.""Southampton 0-1 Nottingham Forest: Steve Cooper's side 'ticked every box'Singh Gill makes league historyHistory was made at St Mary's with Bhupinder Singh Gill becoming the first Sikh-Punjabi to serve as an assistant referee at a Premier League match.The 37-year-old, who qualified as a referee at the age of 14, said earlier that he hoped to inspire the future generation.""My dream has always been to reach the top of the game, be a role model for future officials and encourage more people from diverse backgrounds into officiating, especially from a South Asian background just like me,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64106273
795,Leeds United 2-2 West Ham United: Hammers remain in relegation trouble after Elland Road draw,WED 04 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Lucas Paqueta's leveller was his first goal for West HamWest Ham were denied a much-needed win as Rodrigo drove home a Leeds equaliser to salvage a point in a thrilling encounter at Elland Road.The Hammers seemed set to end their five-match losing run with a victory to mark the passing of joint-chairman David Gold, whose death was announced by the club six hours before kick-off.Teenage forward Wilfried Gnonto had put the hosts ahead when he thrashed the ball home after 27 minutes, only for Lucas Paqueta to level with a well-taken penalty after VAR had intervened following Pascal Struijk's foul on Jarrod Bowen.West Ham, though, could not keep control of a spiky contest after Gianluca Scamacca punished Brenden Aaronson's wayward pass with a first-time shot from 25 yards just 45 seconds into the second half.And with 20 minutes left, Rodrigo stepped inside off a Jack Harrison pass and beat Lukasz Fabianski with a low shot for his 10th goal of the season.In a frantic finish, with tempers fraying in the respective technical areas and Leeds boss Jesse Marsch booked for sarcastically applauding the award of a throw for his team, substitute Michail Antonio and then keeper Fabianski saved the visitors.Antonio cleared Liam Cooper's header off the line, before failing by inches at the other end to turn Manuel Lanzini's injury-time cross.Then, with virtually the final touch, Fabianski produced a brilliant one-handed save to deny Rodrigo.West Ham's struggles continueLeeds 2-2 West Ham United: David Moyes bemoans 'poor goals' as Hammers let lead slipAs a lifelong fan of the game, as well as his beloved West Ham, Gold would probably have appreciated the spectacle of this contest, played as it was at high speed, in pouring rain in front of passionate supporters.The sight of a bunch of flowers on the seat Gold would have occupied was a poignant sight, next to his long-time business partner David Sullivan, who did make the journey to West Yorkshire.But even with a starting line-up finally containing most of West Ham's key transfer window acquisitions, they encountered difficulties.Former Paris St-Germain defender Thilo Kehrer was particularly wasteful in possession and needed to rely on the covering efforts of Nayef Aguerd, making his first league start, to stop his unforced errors being properly punished.Boss David Moyes would have been unhappy at the way Leeds opened up his defence to score their opener and also at how the hosts were able to overpower a midfield containing England World Cup star Declan Rice as the contest reached its crescendo.The performance was better than recent efforts, which should count in the Scot's favour but, in a world where results count, West Ham's league position does not provide much cause for comfort as only goal difference keeps them out of the bottom three.Klich says goodbye - but Gnonto shinesLeeds 2-2 West Ham United: Whites lack 'confidence, belief and commitment' - Jesse MarschThere was an emotional farewell at the final whistle as Leeds midfielder Mateusz Klich waved a tearful goodbye to an appreciative Elland Road crowd as he prepares for an expected move to Major League Soccer and Wayne Rooney's DC United.Marsch even put on a specially-printed Klich T-shirt to mark the occasion, with the Leeds fans remembering the 32-year-old Poland international's immense contribution to the club, which began five years ago when they were still in the Championship.It is Marsch's task to ensure Leeds do not end up back there and, in striker Patrick Bamford's continuing injury-enforced absence, Gnonto could help them.Nine goals in 65 Swiss Super League games wouldn't normally be enough to earn a player much in the way of reputation on their arrival in the Premier League.But Gnonto has already got a song in his honour, in addition to his eight Italy caps.And the calm manner in which the 19-year-old thrashed home his first goal for the club past Fabianski hinted at cult status if he keeps performing in this manner.Gnonto exchanged passes with Crysencio Summerville in the build-up to the strike, bringing pace and direction to a Leeds attack that has been too ponderous at times this season.Relive West Ham's draw with Leeds",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64106277
796,Aston Villa 1-1 Wolverhampton Wanderers: Danny Ings denies Wolves in West Midlands derby,WED 04 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Ings has scored four goals in seven Premier League appearances against WolvesSubstitute Danny Ings' late equaliser earned Aston Villa a point and denied Wolves an important Premier League victory in their West Midlands derby at Villa Park.Ings cancelled out Daniel Podence's delightful first-half strike as he lifted the ball past Jose Sa after his run behind the defence was picked out by Tyrone Mings' superb pass.Podence ensured the visitors capitalised on their purposeful start as the Portuguese forward weaved past Douglas Luiz before curling a 12th-minute opener beyond World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.Making his first appearance since lifting the World Cup with Argentina last month, Golden Glove winner Martinez was called upon to deny Matheus Nunes at close range as the visitors continued to offer the greater threat.The hosts eventually sparked into action in the final 20 minutes, with Max Kilman heading Ludwig Augustinsson's shot off the line before Ings' leveller.But despite relentless pressure they were unable to force a late winner and an emotional Leon Bailey had to be consoled by his team-mates at the full-time whistle after he missed a late chance, shooting wide from an angle after rounding Sa in stoppage time.""It's a huge chance. He was crying but it is good,"" Villa manager Unai Emery, speaking to BBC Sport, said on Bailey's chance.""If he is crying it is because he was feeling, and to feel moments like that and to have the responsibility is good.

Once again, although this time in the West Midlands, Lopetegui saw his side denied victory, one which would have lifted Wolves out of the relegation places.Wolves' shortcomings in attack have been key to their early season struggles - they remain the league's lowest scorers with 11 goals in 18 games - but a rare moment of quality from Podence ensured their encouraging start did not go unrewarded. Ezri Konsa had already cleared Nathan Collins' goal-bound header off the line by that point, while only Martinez's quick reactions prevented Nunes extending the advantage.Losing lead to Villa a pity - LopeteguiVilla have looked well-organised in defence and dynamic in attack so far under Emery but they struggled to maintain momentum from Sunday's impressive 2-0 away win at Tottenham against a highly-motivated Wolves.Despite an encouraging start to life under Emery there were signs of frustration among the home support with the hosts second-best for large periods in the first half, and the half-time whistle was greeted with some boos.But Wolves retreated following the break and Bailey, Cash, Buendia and Augustinsson all had efforts repelled amid a flurry of chances before Ings' finish had Villa Park expecting a late winner.Undoubtedly the greatest chance to win the match fell to Bailey, who was evidently still reliving his 94th-minute miss as he sunk to the ground at full-time.The Jamaican winger later posted on his Instagram: ""I am really sorry Villans. I feel at blame for [us] not coming away with all three points tonight.""Bailey added: ""It's really hard to take and I'm very disappointed in myself.

First he found Son Heung-min, who picked out Matt Doherty to slot home.And then he set Son away with a long ball forward with the South Korean smashing home, via a deflection, to end a 12-game scoreless run for club and country.A satisfying score in the end after a very sloppy first half.Had Palace taken one of their chances before the break, with Hugo Lloris denying Jordan Ayew well, it could have been so different.Get reaction from Wednesday's Premier League games hereGo straight to all the best Crystal Palace contentVisit our Tottenham pageConstant Kane gives Spurs what they needConte 'happy' for Kane & Son goalsIn a crazy world, it is nice to have something or someone to rely on.

798,Arsenal 0-0 Newcastle United: Newcastle earn point against league-leaders Arsenal,TUE 03 Jan 2023,premier-league,"Arsenal failed to score at Emirates Stadium for the first time since March 2022Newcastle United frustrated Premier League leaders Arsenal to earn a point with a dogged display at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal were hoping to extend their lead at the top of the table to 10 points but found themselves drawn into an attritional and dogged encounter by a Newcastle Untied side with top four ambitions of their own. Chances were at a premium and Newcastle's Joelinton arguably wasted the best of all when he headed wide with the goal at his mercy in first-half stoppage time. Arsenal went close through defender Gabriel and forward Gabriel Martinelli, who both sent headers narrowly off target, while Newcastle keeper Nick Pope made a crucial late save with his legs from Eddie Nketiah. The Gunners also appeared to have a clear penalty claim rejected when Gabriel was hauled back by Dan Burn.The game descended into a scrappy affair with seven yellow cards and the deadlock remained unbroken, with Arsenal's lead now eight points despite being held at home.'Newcastle are now a serious Premier League force'Arsenal denied two 'scandalous' penalties, says ArtetaArteta left disappointed Arteta unhappy after 'scandalous' penalty decisions against NewcastleIt may only be early January but Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's frantic touchline behaviour perhaps gave an insight into the growing expectations surrounding the Gunners after their superb season so far. Arteta was on the edge of his technical area for so much of the night right until the end, confronting fourth official Jarred Gillett when only five minutes were added on at the end then moving towards opposite number Eddie Howe after late penalty appeals were rejected before being ushered away. It certainly did not give off an air of calm when one was needed as Newcastle's determined defensive approach and desire to drag Arsenal into a dogfight led to frustration all round. When Arteta calms down he can still assess a job being well done but this was a night when his Arsenal team ran into a formidable barrier in the shape of Newcastle, their work deteriorating after a bright start, although they still nearly snatched it at the end through Nketiah. Arsenal still have that eight-point lead, although Manchester City have a game in hand.It was never going to be all plain sailing for the Gunners and this was one of those occasions, the demeanour of Arteta reflecting what Newcastle will regard as a highly satisfactory outcome. Newcastle demonstrate progress Howe praises Newcastle's resilience against ArsenalNewcastle's run into the top four ran into resistance against Leeds United at St James' Park but showed they can dig deep themselves as they battled to earn a crucial point at Arsenal. Manager Eddie Howe will be delighted with both the performance and the result, although he will know it might have been even better had Joelinton converted a relatively simple headed opportunity. This will be a minor complaint overall as Newcastle showed they were prepared to fight for everything, over-zealously in the eyes of some Arsenal fans, but they will not care and nor will the Toon Army, who noisily celebrated the point at the final whistle. Newcastle were well organised, tried to threaten when they could and reaffirmed the huge improvement they have made under Howe and with the influx of cash from their Saudi Arabian owners. The top four was a pipe dream at the start of the season but Newcastle are genuinely in that conversation now and showed why as they earned what could be a vital draw.

They doubled their lead four minutes into the second period as Shaw, playing in his more accustomed left-back role again, swept home an Alejandro Garnacho cut-back to complete a beautiful free-flowing move. Marcus Rashford then rounded off the scoring, tapping into an empty net after a Bruno Fernandes pass, to score in three successive Old Trafford league games for the first time.""The strides we are taking are going in the right direction that we want,"" said Shaw. ""There is still a lot to improve on but things are looking really good and positive.""We feel like the belief and confidence is back, and you can feel it around the place, not just with the players and the staff but you can feel it in the stadium and around the fans.""Hopefully they are enjoying it at the moment but I feel there is a lot more to come and hopefully we can keep putting smiles on people's faces.""United had started slowly, having a lot of possession in their defensive third but, once they found the opener, a seventh successive home win in all competitions never felt in doubt. They stay fourth, but join third-placed Newcastle on 35 points, and, perhaps most importantly, have opened up a five-point cushion on fifth-placed Tottenham. One negative for United was a first-half injury sustained by midfielder Donny van de Beek, with Ten Hag saying ""we need to wait 24 hours, but it is not looking very good"".

He ghosted in behind the Bournemouth defence, opened his body and steered Eriksen's pinpoint cross from the left into the top corner. It broke the game open after a tentative start and that allowed Shaw to score a magnificent end-to-end goal. The England left-back started the move on the edge of his own box, before tucking home from the penalty spot. Rashford was then supplied with the easiest of finishes for his fourth goal in four games since the post-World Cup resumption. United host neighbours Man City in their next league game on 14 January, and could end that game above their city rivals, which would be a strong indication of the improvement they are making under Ten Hag. Despite that the Dutchman was unhappy with his side's display, saying: ""Today it was not our best game. We have to be honest, we didn't play that smart as a team. ""We made great goals, but at times we were quite lucky, and some great saves from David [de Gea]. We could have been smarter as a team.""Nervy times for BournemouthBournemouth didn't deserve to lose 3-0 - Gary O'NeilGames against the likes of United are not going to decide Bournemouth's Premier League future, but manager Gary O'Neil wanted a reaction after ""the worst"" performance of his reign against Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve.

""I think we had maybe six or seven chances but obviously Manchester United had some as well.""We need to be sure that we produce that every week.""To concede from a set-piece, after limiting United in the early exchanges, will frustrate O'Neil, as will a goal so close to his half-time team talk.

Ashley Young covered, having initially played Perisic onside, and managed to direct the effort behind for a corner.Perisic should have scored shortly after Buendia's opener when the ball fell kindly 15 yards out and he scooped over the bar.However, Spurs set an unwanted club record of conceding at least two goals in seven successive Premier League fixtures.They looked toothless in attack - Bryan Gil made his first league start in place of the injured Dejan Kulusevski, but was replaced just past the hour following an anonymous display - and Conte looked more miserable as his side slipped towards another worrying defeat.Antonio Conte says his side don't have many creative players",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64088553

Right-back Serge Aurier showed terrific composure to cancel out Raheem Sterling's goal with a fine equaliser.It is the first point Steve Cooper's side have taken after going behind this season and extends their unbeaten home run to six games in all competitions. ""To show the resilience to come back is very good,"" Yates told Sky Sports. ""I thought we were unlucky to not win based off the second half.""It is a step in the right direction. The manager just said 'believe in yourselves more' at half-time. It is something to build on - we're not satisfied with drawing games at home but it is a start."" The point means Forest move above Wolverhampton Wanderers into 18th and are only behind fourth-bottom West Ham United on goal difference. Chelsea, who have now only won successive league games once under Graham Potter since he was appointed on 8 September, climb above Brighton into eighth but are seven points behind Manchester United in fourth.Forest news and fan views in one placeChelsea news and transfer latestForest to investigate alleged homophobic chantingCrowd drive Forest to drawForest should have beaten Chelsea - CooperIn the first half Forest were keen to use the pace of Brennan Johnson in behind the Chelsea defence and he came closest for the hosts in a one-on-one with Kepa Arrizabalaga.Despite falling behind early on, the atmosphere at the City Ground built throughout the half, inspired in part by the crowd becoming frustrated by the performance of referee Peter Bankes. Cooper's team then leapt out of the blocks after the break, with Johnson having an effort saved before Gibbs-White rattled the underside of the bar with a wonderful strike.The runs of Johnson and Taiwo Awoniyi in the channels caused Chelsea problems throughout the game, but as has been the case throughout the season - they have only scored 12 goals in 17 league games - they lacked cutting edge in the final third. It took a superb piece of finishing from defender Aurier to earn them a point but with signs of Cooper settling on his best 11 and a vocal fan base, they look as if they will make a good fist of preserving their top-flight status.Speaking to Match of the Day, Cooper said: ""Everything we do at the moment is about us, how we grow the team, the spirit and identity. ""I know we didn't win today but it was a good reference point that we can play against the big teams in the league. ""We're in control of our destiny and we have to keep building.""Reaction to Nottingham Forest v Chelsea, plus BBC Radio 5 Live's 606Chelsea's away day blues continueChelsea below par in Forest draw - PotterChelsea went into the game knowing anything but three points would leave them further behind the top four after wins for Manchester United and Liverpool in the previous 48 hours.They began with good intent and Mason Mount produced two threatening efforts before Sterling reacted quickest to smash Chelsea ahead after Boly - who was under pressure from Kai Harvetz - inadvertently back-heeled a Christian Pulisic cross onto the bar.But the visitors were then lacklustre and failed to have a shot on target after the break despite Potter using all five substitutions in an attempt to change the game. That said, one of the players introduced, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, could have won Potter's side the game but he failed to make proper contact with a header after a wicked cross from substitute Hakim Ziyech.It leaves Chelsea, who struggled to cope with Forest's second-half pace and intensity, with one win in their last five games in all competitions, and without a victory in five Premier League away matches. Speaking to Sky Sports, Potter said: ""It is a hard-earned point, against a team that are set up well. They put us under pressure second half. ""Our performance level wasn't good enough to take the three points. We didn't move the ball fast enough, not enough movement.""Forest played a good game but we're disappointed with our performance over the 90 minutes and concerned we didn't deserve the win.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64088552

It's a great win, we re-wrote the history of this club,"" Osimhen said.""We keep dreaming, we don't have limits. We follow our coach and look ahead.""With a commanding 18-point lead at the top of Serie A, Napoli head into the last eight with a real chance to compete for top prize in European football.Eintracht fans clash with police in NaplesThe build-up to the match had been overshadowed as Eintracht Frankfurt fans clashed with police after arriving in Naples despite being banned from attending the second leg of the last-16 tie.Once the game did start, it was the visitors who had the first effort of note as Rafael Borre headed off target in the 10th minute but from there Napoli took charge.The electric Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was the main threat in the first half, slaloming through the Frankfurt defence in the 19th minute before seeing his effort from a tight angle saved by Kevin Trapp in the visitors' goal.Kvaratskhelia went close again three minutes before the break after another driving run but was again denied by Trapp.The breakthrough came on the stroke of half-time when Matteo Politano dug out a cross from the right and Osimhen powered the header back past the goalkeeper.After the break, with the tie all but settled, Napoli were able to show more of the attacking flair that has brought them such success this season and after good work from Di Lorenzo down the right, Osimhen was waiting to finish as he stretched at the far post.The goal was Napoli's 24th in this season's Champions League, taking them past Benfica as the competition's top scorers and when Djibril Sow upended Zielinski with a clumsy challenge in the box, the Polish midfielder calmly dispatched the 64th-minute spot kick to make it 25.Frankfurt did have the chance to make the game slightly more nervy before the penalty but Daichi Kamada failed to convert from inside the six yard box.As it was, Napoli were able to enjoy the last half hour as they completed the joint-largest aggregate win by an Italian side in the Champions League knockout stages to join Serie A rivals Inter and AC Milan in the quarters.Will Napoli's Osimhen make Premier League move?",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64969965
805,Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool (6-2 agg): Reds dumped out of Champions League,WED 15 Mar 2023,champions-league,"Karim Benzema has scored more Champions League goals against Liverpool (seven) than against any other teamLiverpool's Champions League hopes ended at the hands of Real Madrid for a third consecutive season as they failed to overcome their first-leg Anfield demolition.The Reds, who lost the first leg 5-2, lined up with four forwards at the Bernabeu as they looked to add another famous comeback to their fabled European history.But that rarely looked on the cards and legendary Real striker Karim Benzema put the tie beyond doubt when he tucked in from Vinicius Jr's cutback late on.Jurgen Klopp's side would have lost this game by more if not for Alisson.The Reds goalkeeper denied Vinicius and Eduardo Camavinga with magnificent first-half stops.If Darwin Nunez had taken a chance in the sixth minute, then it could have been a different story.Liverpool players walked off to 'You'll Never Walk Alone' on the Bernabeu speakers as they reflected on their biggest ever aggregate Champions League defeat.The Reds were beaten finalists against Real last summer but now face a battle to even be in the tournament next season, sitting six points behind the Champions League places.One downside for Carlo Ancelotti's Real was Benzema hurting himself while scoring and having to be replaced. However afterwards the striker said he will be fine for Sunday's must-win El Clasico with Barcelona.Klopp admits to 'massive task' - has he been too loyal?Liverpool news and fan views in one placeNo miracle of MadridChampions League is 'the' competition, we want to be part of it - KloppThis was the 92nd time a team have lost by three or more goals in the first leg at home in a European Cup tie. All 92 have been eliminated.Data analysts Gracenote gave Liverpool a 3.92% probability of progression and Jurgen Klopp talked about a ""1% chance"" beforehand.That was the challenge they faced after Madrid put on an exhibition of taking their chances at Anfield.But still, this is Liverpool and this is the Champions League. In 2005 they came from 3-0 down to beat Ancelotti's Milan in the Champions League final. Three years ago they lost 3-0 to Barcelona and won the second leg 4-0, although crucially that was at home.Liverpool gave it a go - they had to - with forwards Diogo Jota, Nunez, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo in their line-up.Had Nunez scored after six minutes instead of shooting at Thibaut Courtois, who knows what might have happened. The Uruguayan forced another two saves from the goalkeeper, most notably with a fine curling effort after cutting in from the left wing.But really they were lucky to only lose this leg 1-0. There was no gung-ho, 'heavy metal', blockbuster attempt to go and win it.They did not even have a shot between James Milner's blocked effort in the 37th minute and Harvey Elliott's attempt on target after 82 minutes.It could have got slightly worse in injury time when referee Felix Zwayer went to the monitor to see if Konstantinos Tsimikas had handled the ball, but the decision was no penalty to Real.So just like in last year's final in Paris, and the previous season's quarter-final, Real were Liverpool's conquerors.The Reds will undoubtedly finish this season trophy-less and it will be a huge blow to their future plans if they cannot overtake Newcastle and Tottenham to finish fourth in the Premier League come the end of the season.Champions League kings march onAncelotti said beforehand that psychologically ""it's tougher for us than Liverpool"" because the Reds knew they had to go ""all out from the first minute"".But it was Real who had the bulk of the chances. They had 17 shots here, compared to the nine efforts that yielded five goals on Merseyside.Alisson somehow saved Vinicius' close-range volley with an outstretched arm. Then he tipped Camavinga's deflected, looping long-range strike on to the crossbar.Luka Modric drilled a shot just over from outside the box. After the break Alisson denied Federico Valverde and Benzema in quick succession.Valverde was unmarked when he headed another chance over.Eventually the pressure told when Benzema slotted in from Vinicius' ball as they got in behind the Reds' defence. That was his seventh Champions League goal against the Reds, a record for any player.Benzema said he took a kick to the shin but will be fit for Sunday's trip to the Nou Camp. Real need a win to keep their La Liga title hopes alive, as they trail leaders Barcelona by nine points.But for now the 14-time European champions can deservedly celebrate reaching a 19th Champions League quarter-final.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64959699

His five hat-tricks are three more than any other player in the big five leagues.On any normal day, Ilkay Gundogan's precise low shot into the bottom corner would have merited praise. On this historic night, which matched City's 7-0 triumph over Schalke in 2019, it was nothing more than a footnote.On this evidence, no-one, not even Real Madrid, will want to be paired with Pep Guardiola's side in Friday's last-eight draw. Legendary former club captain Vincent Kompany can only hope his old club have got this calibre of performance out of their system when he brings his Burnley side to Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup on Saturday.Records tumble as Haaland hits five past LeipzigChelsea and Man City await next European opponentsMan City news and fan views in one placeHaaland haunts former boss RoseLeipzig coach Marco Rose was Haaland's boss at Dortmund last season. Little wonder he reacted with incredulity on the eve of the game when it was pointed out to him that some feel City are a lesser team with the Norwegian in it.""It could get really, really, really good for him with Pep and Man City,"" was Rose's response.He would have preferred his words not to be proved quite so perceptive, quite so soon.Leipzig were given a very early warning about the difficulties that lay ahead when Nathan Ake dropped a long pass over their defence and in the space of half a dozen strides Haaland had sprinted clear of their defence and bore down on goal.Goalkeeper Janis Blaswich managed to deny Haaland the opener - but it was to be his last success of the night in that personal duel.Five-star Haaland offers up finishing masterclassRose may argue City should not have been awarded the penalty that gave Haaland the chance to open the scoring.True, Benjamin Henrichs was very close to Rodri - but once VAR intervened it was also obvious the defender had his arms out when the City man headed the ball against his hand. Haaland kept his cool, buried the penalty and, as the visiting bench were still grumbling at the unfairness of it all, made it 2-0 when he reacted quickest after De Bruyne's thunderous shot came back off the crossbar and headed into an empty net.And when Amadou Haidara's clearance off the line, after Blaswich had turned away Ruben Dias' header, bounced straight into the advancing Haaland to give him his hat-trick in first-half stoppage time, Leipzig might have been tempted to concede.But there was more punishment to come for the hapless visitors.Gundogan's well-taken strike was followed by Haaland's fourth, which came when Blaswich saved a Manuel Akanji effort and again it fell just right for the Norwegian.When he turned home a fifth for the first time in his career, Haaland had effectively scored five times in 35 minutes.Hs dad Alfie, watching from an executive box high in the stadium, was on his feet leading the applause.Probably wisely, Guardiola decided there was not much point in Haaland staying on the pitch. He left to a standing ovation from a crowd both appreciative and incredulous at what they had just seen.City eased off with the job emphatically done before De Bruyne scored with virtually the last kick as Leipzig were condemned to their heaviest European defeat.Latest Manchester City news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man City news notifications",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64943666

However, while PSG's star forward line sporadically threatened early on neither was given the time or space to inflict any damage on a disciplined and efficient Bayern side, who ran out comfortable winners.The only major concern for the German champions arrived in the first period and was entirely self-inflicted.  Goalkeeper Yann Sommer - who was caught in possession by Achraf Hakimi - presented visiting midfielder Vitinha with an open goal but defender Matthijs de Ligt made a superb sliding intervention for the home side.The draw for the last eight of the competition takes place on 17 March in Nyon, Switzerland.Is Bayern's dominance bad for the Bundesliga?Reaction from Wednesday's Champions League actionEfficient Bayern prove too good for PSGSommer's mistake should have been punished and provided PSG with the momentum to go on and win the tie, in the same manner that Real Madrid did against them almost exactly 12 months ago.However, Vitinha's weak finish was symptomatic of a side that has promised much but too often failed to deliver on big European nights - and who failed to score in a knockout tie for the first time since the 1994-95 semi-finals against AC Milan.Sergio Ramos and Mbappe both saw second-half efforts well saved by Swiss international Sommer but by then the damage had been done and Bayern were in the ascendancy. The German side's control and strength in reserve was also underlined by their changes with Julian Nagelsmann able to introduce Gnabry, Mane, Joao Cancelo and Leroy Sane while bringing off the likes of Thomas Muller and the impressive Jamal Musiala.The impact of Portugal international Cancelo - who is on loan at Bayern from Manchester City - was immediate, as he laid on a goal for Gnabry within three minutes of his introduction to put the tie beyond doubt.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64879878
809,Tottenham 0-0 AC Milan (0-1 agg): Spurs out of Champions League after shutout,WED 08 Mar 2023,champions-league,"Tottenham are out of all the cup competitions they entered this seasonTottenham Hotspur's Champions League campaign ended in bitterly disappointing fashion as they failed to overturn a first-leg deficit in the last 16 against AC Milan. Spurs paid the price for another passive start that allowed Milan to settle into their task - the misery complete when defender Cristian Romero was sent off late on after receiving a second yellow card for a wild challenge on Theo Hernandez. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg tested AC Milan keeper Mike Maignan with a powerful second-half shot and Harry Kane headed wide, but Spurs failed to mount sustained pressure on the Italian defence. A late Kane header was brilliantly kept out by Maignan before Divock Origi struck the post for the visitors as Spurs went out tamely, their season now resting on the battle for a top-four place in the Premier League. 'End of Conte's loveless Spurs reign surely a formality'Bayern Munich cruise past Paris St-Germain to reach quarter-finalsReaction from all Wednesday's Champions League actionSpurs simply not good enoughSpurs fans reacted angrily as their Champions League campaign came to a conclusion and their discontent was understandable after such a dismal performance. The lack of urgency that has marked so much of their season has never been more stark than in the first 45 minutes when Spurs played as if they were barely aware they needed to score to keep their ambitions alive. Manager Antonio Conte returned to the technical area after recuperating from gallbladder surgery but this did not spare him the wrath of the Spurs support mystified by such a conservative approach. He was not helped by Romero's red card for a late, reckless tackle on Hernandez, having already received a first-half caution for a clumsy challenge to prevent Rafael Leao breaking clear.Kane almost rescued Spurs and sent the game into extra time with that late header, but for most of the night he was starved of meaningful service in a side largely devoid of creativity. What this means for Conte's long-term future remains to be seen, with growing uncertainty surrounding his position and his contract up at the end of the season. Spurs now have only that top-four place to fight for, and on this form you would not back them to achieve it. They have scrambled through much of this season despite indifferent form but there was to be no reprieve here - and they did not deserve one. Tomori top class for MilanFikayo Tomori has slipped out of the England reckoning, but his calm and measured performance was a timely reminder of the qualities he can offer should manager Gareth Southgate require them. The 25-year-old former Chelsea defender has matured in Serie A and was a rock in the Milan defence here - strong in the air, showing impeccable timing with his tackles and calm on the ground. Spurs hardly subjected Milan to intense scrutiny, but when needed Tomori was excellent and a key figure as they reached the quarter-finals. Milan were also well-served by keeper Maignan, faultless throughout and producing a moment of brilliance to keep out Kane in the closing seconds. Spurs can have no complaints over the two legs, with Milan probably surprised by the absence of intensity in front of a home crowd waiting for the opportunity to roar their side on.

I am not in control of that.""I understand why you are asking me that question and it has probably been aimed at me for some weeks now.""I can't really control that. I am not in that position to understand it and you are asking probably the wrong person.

You don't want to go out like that.""Club Bruges rarely looked like turning the tie around, with Benfica even having the ball in the net after two minutes through Joao Mario, but it was ruled out for offside.Reaction to Tuesday's Champions League gamesDespite that early chance, the visitors did well to hold off their opponents for 38 minutes and were starting to look threatening when Silva scored, keeping his cool to control the ball from a cross before slotting in.From then on Club Bruges capitulated as the tie looked beyond them and another fine finish, this time from Portugal forward Ramos, ended the game as a contest. Mario's penalty came either side of clinical finishes by Ramos and Neres, but Meijer did at least give the travelling fans something to cheer with an exquisite first-time finish into the top corner.Since the Champions League was formed, Benfica have lost all five quarter-finals they have played in, but this result and performance will give them hope of taking the next step.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64881073
811,Chelsea 2-0 Borussia Dortmund (agg 2-1): Blues fight back to reach last eight,TUE 07 Mar 2023,champions-league,"Kai Havertz converted his penalty at the second attemptGraham Potter enjoyed his finest night as Chelsea manager as they overcame a first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Potter was under huge pressure after a dismal run of results following Chelsea's huge outlay in the transfer market, but he will hope the manner of this performance and the advance into the latter stages of Europe's elite competition will deliver a measure of calm and stability to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea fully deserved their win, although they squandered several big opportunities before Raheem Sterling made the breakthrough after 43 minutes, firing past Dortmund keeper Alexander Meyer after initially fluffing his shot. The goal which settled the tie and overturned Dortmund's 1-0 advantage from the first leg came in contentious fashion from the penalty spot eight minutes after the break. Dortmund were furious when a VAR review penalised Marius Wolf for handball from Ben Chilwell's cross and their sense of injustice heightened after Kai Havertz struck the post with his spot-kick only for a re-take to be ordered. This time Havertz made no mistake and Chelsea were on their way into the last eight. Speaking after the game, Potter said: ""The players were tremendous and the supporters were tremendous.""We had to be against a team that were doing so well. Over the two games I felt that we deserved to go through. It was a special night.""Follow Tuesday's Champions League actionLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news notificationsChelsea 2-0 Borussia Dortmund: Blues manager Graham Potter delighted by victoryIs this lift-off for Potter?Potter was been waiting for a show of strength such as this from the moment he left Brighton to take over at Chelsea, succeeding Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel.Potter has struggled to convince Chelsea's fans he has the personality required to take on this occasionally dysfunctional football beast and his cause has not been helped by poor Premier League form and a battle to establish any sort of shape and stability from the influx of players assembled at vast expense by new owner Todd Boehly.The pressure was released somewhat with Saturday's narrow win over Leeds United at Stamford Bridge but a big Champions League win against opponents of such European pedigree as Borussia Dortmund will go some way to convincing the doubters that Potter is cut out for the task.There is still much work to do as Chelsea lie in a wholly unacceptable 10th place in the Premier League and two victories will not change the landscape instantly but there is no doubt Stamford Bridge felt like a much happier place when Dutch referee Danny Makkelie sounded his final whistle.Potter will have been satisfied to see big performances from fit-again Reece James with Ben Chilwell also outstanding. And his former Brighton player Marc Cucurella also looked much more at home than he has before.The scenes at the final whistle were a sharp contrast to many witnessed at Stamford Bridge this season with Potter punching the air in front of joyous Chelsea supporters as their Champions League journey continues.Potter added: ""To win a game and go into the last eight of the Champions League, it's up there with one of the games or evenings of my career. ""I watched the first penalty and it didn't work so well. I can't do anything. It's down to Kai and his talent and testament and that's at the top level.""Subdued Bellingham still shows class Bellingham (centre) has scored 10 goals in all competitions for Dortmund this seasonAll eyes were England teenager Jude Bellingham from the moment he arrived at Stamford Bridge, with waiting Chelsea fans making an instant sales pitch for the young star, who is expected to be pursued by every big club in Europe this summer. This was not Bellingham's best night as Dortmund's Champions League campaign came to an end with the added disappointment of squandering a first-leg lead, but the 19-year-old still showed why he will be in such demand. Bellingham's night had low points, such as when he poked a great chance wide from eight yards in the second half and a very poor challenge in the closing seconds that left Reece James prostrate and brought a yellow card. He did, however, show class and arrogance on the ball, vision, and a marauding style as Dortmund chased an equaliser in vain after Chelsea grabbed control.

Inter, second in Serie A, nearly scored in the last minute of the first half but Alessandro Bastoni's header was tipped over by Diogo Costa.Hakan Calhanoglu had also seen an earlier header pushed over, with Lautaro Martinez heading over when unmarked from six yards out.Porto also had their moments when it was goalless, but Mateus Uribe and Taremi missed opportunities.Second in Portugal's Primeira Liga, Sergio Conceicao's side had Otavio sent off after he had been booked for dissent in the first half and then shown a second yellow card for a foul on Calhanoglu.Otavio will now miss the second leg, but Porto will still fancy their chances of overturning the deficit at home in three weeks' time.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64724471

Erling Haaland struggled to make an impact on his return to Germany, but really should have scored with one of his few chances in the second half, racing forward before dragging his shot well wide.But while City may be frustrated not to have come away with a win, they will be confident of getting the job done back at the Etihad where they won 17 of 19 games there this season.Should City have had a penalty?Leipzig will rightly be happy with securing a draw considering the vast improvement in their attacking play in the second half, but City will feel aggrieved they did not have the chance to snatch a last-gasp winner.With seconds left, Mahrez sent the ball into the box following a short corner and as the ball was headed towards goal by Rodri, Henrichs appeared to push it away with his hands.There was no indication of a VAR check before the whistle was blown for full-time.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64724464

815,Liverpool 2-5 Real Madrid: Hosts thrashed by holders in Champions League last 16,TUE 21 Feb 2023,champions-league,"Liverpool conceded four goals at Anfield in Europe for the first time in their historyLiverpool have been left with a mountainous task to keep their Champions League ambitions alive after they were torn apart by ruthless Real Madrid at Anfield. Holders Real - who beat Liverpool in last season's final in Paris - became the first side to score five at Anfield in Europe despite going two goals down early on as Liverpool made a dream start to this last-16 tie. Darwin Nunez's brilliant flick put Liverpool ahead after only four minutes before Mohamed Salah cashed in on Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois' poor clearance to double their advantage 10 minutes later. Liverpool's supporters, who had vented their fury at being wrongly blamed for the chaos at last season's final by holding up a flag emblazoned with ""Uefa Liars"" and loudly jeering the Champions League anthem, were soon to have their thunderous celebrations silenced in emphatic fashion. Vinicius Junior's brilliant 21st-minute strike pulled a goal back before Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson followed Courtois' lead by hacking a clearance straight at the Brazilian, holding his head in anguish as the ball looped behind him into the net in front of a disbelieving Kop. It changed the whole emphasis of the contest, Real going ahead two minutes after the break when Eder Militao headed in Luka Modric's free-kick. Real then rammed home their superiority as Karim Benzema's shot deflected in off Joe Gomez, the French striker then coolly adding a fifth after more brilliant work by the ageless Modric. Liverpool have pulled off spectacular comebacks before, but it would be truly extraordinary if they turned this one around at the Bernabeu.'Carlo thinks the tie is over, I think it is as well at the moment''We want this trophy' - Real 'favourites' for glory'Hopeless & slapstick' - Liverpool face 'inquest'Is there any hope for second leg? Send us your views on Liverpool's displayHow the game at Anfield unfoldedLiverpool brutally exposed Liverpool made the start of their dreams as they rattled Real with their high-tempo play, getting the two goals they thought would provide the platform for a night of glory. Instead, Anfield was reduced to near silence by the end as Jurgen Klopp's side were reduced to chasing shadows in the face of Real's imperious style and lethal threat in front of goal. Liverpool did not help their cause with mistakes and dreadful defending, offering up invitations to a side of vast experience and world-class quality that is dangerous enough without being delivered gifts. Alisson was guilty of an uncharacteristic error that saw Real draw level and you could visibly see the belief draining out of the side that has struck fear into opponents so many times at Anfield. Militao's routine header from a free-kick was also helped by poor marking while the unhappy Gomez was unfortunate to deflect in Benzema's first. The danger then was that Liverpool would concede even more as they barely raised a threat after the break.Klopp will no doubt invoke the spirit of Barcelona in the 2019 Champions League semi-final - when Liverpool overcame a 3-0 first-leg deficit to advance with a stunning 4-0 win at Anfield - but this is not the same Liverpool, Real are not as flimsy as the Catalans and this time the second leg is in Spain. If Liverpool somehow pull this one off, it would be one of the most spectacular feats in their history. Football Daily podcast: Liverpool torn apart by ruthless Real MadridLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsGet Liverpool news notificationsRuthless Real show sheer classReal's run to winning the Champions League last season was full of moments when they looked to be in genuine strife, first against Chelsea then especially against Manchester City in the semi-final. And yet, under the calm guidance and wisdom the great coach Carlo Ancelotti, Real held their nerve on those occasions to win, eventually lifting the trophy against the opponents they blew away at Anfield on Tuesday. Vinicius was the catalyst in Paris and turned the game here, firing a shot cross past Alisson before closing down the keeper for Real's second. After that, Real were truly outstanding as they controlled possession, kept Liverpool at arm's length with ease and put away those three second-half goals that put them in complete command of this tie. Inspired by the two great veterans Modric and Benzema, Real have an iron belief that they will prevail and so it proved again. Many sides would have subsided after going two goals down so soon but Real simply kept playing, confident their chances would come, and they did. Ancelotti is too experienced to allow any complacency but he will know this is a truly outstanding result for any side to achieve at Anfield, even the Champions League holders.

Dortmund were not much better, but showed the clinical touch when Adeyemi broke, powered past Fernandez and then Kepa before slotting into the net.The travelling fans were left frustrated - as Chelsea were arguably the better side against hosts who had won their previous six games.Chelsea haven't scored twice in a game since the start of November, underlining the enormity of their task in the return leg unless things improve significantly in the final third.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64641040

818,AC Milan 1-0 Tottenham: Antonio Conte's side fall to narrow first-leg loss in last 16,TUE 14 Feb 2023,champions-league,"Brahim Diaz's only two Champions League goals have come against English oppositionTottenham will have to produce a Champions League comeback after Brahim Diaz gave AC Milan a narrow win in the first leg of their last-16 tie at the San Siro.Diaz nodded in early on after Spurs goalkeeper Fraser Forster had saved a Theo Hernandez shot and then superbly got a hand on the scorer's initial follow-up attempt.Antonio Conte's side looked relatively comfortable for long periods of the contest against the seven-time European champions - as a youthful pairing of Pape Sarr and Oliver Skipp deputised ably for the suspended Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and the injured Rodrigo Bentancur in midfield.However, they were rarely able to build any attacking momentum with their front three of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and, until his withdrawal, Dejan Kulusevski well shackled by a disciplined home defence.Aside from ambitious long-range efforts from Emerson Royal and Sarr, Conte's side appeared most capable of threatening from set-pieces but neither Kane nor Eric Dier were able to direct headers on goal from two excellent Son deliveries.In the end, Spurs were grateful for the profligacy of the hosts as Belgian midfielder Charles de Ketelaere and German defender Malick Thiaw both headed excellent opportunities - to put the Italian side firmly in control of the tie - wide. Had either nodded in from close range, Spurs would have faced an even more challenging recovery operation in the return leg in London on Wednesday, 8 March.As it is, they must try to turn the tie round without Dier, who will be suspended after he collected a second-half booking.All Tuesday's Champions League reactionFootball Daily podcast: UCL Away Days - Valentine's in MilanMilan continue bounce back against SpursPrior to last Friday's victory over Torino, Stefano Pioli's side had endured a miserable start to 2023, picking up just two points from a possible 15 - and slipping to fifth in Serie A.However, while they do not possess the star quality or swagger of the great Milan sides, they displayed plenty of know-how to carve out a slender lead. Their only regret will be not to have put the tie beyond a Spurs side that competed well but barely laid a glove on them in the final third.As it is, a place in the quarter-finals very much hangs in the balance, although Conte will still have to figure out a way to compensate for the loss of Uruguay international Bentancur, who has become a key player since arriving from Juventus just over 12 months ago.The Italian will also demand greater diligence in defence from his side with Argentine Cristian Romero sure to come under scrutiny for his role in Milan's win.The World Cup-winning centre-back was outjumped and left floundering by Hernandez in the build-up to the home side's goal and was later booked for an ill-timed challenge on the lively Rafael Leao.Stopping the Portugal international's menacing runs in the second leg will be critical to Spurs' hopes as they bid to prevent Milan from reaching the quarter-finals for the first time since 2012.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64632017

The Frenchman was born in 2006, the same year in which Messi, 35, won his first Champions League title.Mbappe, initially expected to miss this match with a thigh injury, was brought on after 57 minutes, but was clearly far from full fitness.PSG struggled to create any chances of note in the first half, while Bayern dominated possession but lacked a cutting edge until Coman struck in the 53rd minute.The winger, who started in the youth team at PSG, met a deep Alphonso Davies cross from the left with a first-time volley.Coman's effort squeezed under PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, although the Italian made up for it later with superb saves to deny Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting and Pavard.Mbappe's arrival lifted PSG and Yann Sommer kept out his close-range shot before the Bayern keeper was beaten in the 82nd minute.Home celebrations were cut short, though, as left-back Nuno Mendes was ruled narrowly offside by the video assistant referee (VAR) before he delivered a cross for Mbappe to finish into the roof of the net.Following losses to Marseille in the Coupe de France and Monaco in Ligue 1, another damaging defeat piles the pressure on manager Christophe Galtier.PSG, who have still never won the Champions League, now face a tough task in the return leg in Germany on 8 March.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64629812

However, Doyle and team-mate Jamie McAtee will not be allowed to play against City because loan players cannot face their parent clubs. ""It's an unbelievable feeling, getting the goal at the end and celebrating in front of the fans who were unbelievable - it's a special feeling,"" Doyle told BBC Radio Sheffield.""It sat up lovely for me - I just touched it and thought, with the state of the game and how things were going, 'I'm going to hit it' and thankfully it flew into the top corner.""It could be a memorable season for the Yorkshire side, who are second in the Championship and chasing a return to the Premier League.""As players you want to step up in big moments - I say that to myself all the time, to try and step up and be counted, and thankfully today I did that and to be fair so did the lads,"" added Doyle.""We know that when we step up to the plate not many teams can live with us, and we needed to find another level at the end.""While it was a euphoric finish for the Blades, it was heartbreaking for a Blackburn side who were looking to make it into their first semi-final since 2007 - and make a debut appearance at the new Wembley - though they remain in good shape for a play-off place in the second tier.A topsy-turvy tieJon Dahl Tomasson's side had looked comfortable heading into the final 10 minutes but, when McBurnie's leveller went in, the hosts seized the initiative and with the crowd behind them, made it a fantastic finale that will live long in the memory of the Bramall Lane faithful. Blackburn made a fast start to the game with Ryan Hedges finding top scorer Brereton Diaz on the edge of the box within the opening minute, but the striker could not quite get his shot away before being dispossessed.The hosts weathered the early storm and James McAtee had a golden opportunity to put his side in front after eight minutes when he was put through on goal, but in the end it was a tame effort at Rovers goalkeeper Aynsley Pears. Rovers then went up the other end to launch the attack that would lead to the opening goal, as Tyler Morton crossed for Gallagher and his shot on goal was blocked by Robinson's arm. Referee Tim Robinson did not initially give the spot-kick but was asked to consult the video monitor by VAR, and he awarded the penalty which Brereton Diaz despatched confidently.Chile striker Brereton Diaz's goal was his 14th of the season for BlackburnThe Blades' equaliser came from a lucky break as Blackburn cleared a corner which came to Max Lowe about 25 yards out, and the defender's shot was heading off-target before Gallagher stuck out a knee trying to make a block - only to see it spin away into the net. The hosts created two good openings within minutes of the restart but McAtee's heavy touch passed-up a good chance in the box before George Baldock hit the side-netting. At the other end, Wes Foderingham was then forced into a fine double save, first diving low to his left to deny Harry Pickering and then pushing out Brereton Diaz's follow-up.McAtee then missed another big chance shortly before the hour as he seized on Lewis Travis' loose pass to go one-on-one with Pears, with the goalkeeper poking out a boot to deny him again. Szmodics showed him how it was done moments later when Morton won the ball back in midfield and found Gallagher, who slipped the midfielder in and he finished expertly, shooting across Foderingham into the corner.Rovers were a whisker away from a third with 20 minutes remaining as Ryan Hedges' well-struck left-foot shot beat Foderingham, only to hit the inside of the post and roll across the goalmouth. The hosts had looked to be struggling to find an equaliser but were back on level terms with 10 minutes left when McBurnie collected Lowe's pass before turning past two defenders and finishing low past Pears. The goal changed the momentum completely and the hosts poured forward in search of the winner, which when it came was a strike of real quality, as Doyle steadied himself before unleashing a rocket which Pears could only tip further into the top corner.FA Cup: All the angles of Doyle's 'magnificent strike'Play should have stopped before winner - TomassonSpeaking after the match, Blackburn boss Tomasson said play should have been stopped before Doyle's winner as Morton was down with an eye injury.""The head injury for Morton, they say it was only a finger in the eye, but he would have been standing in that zone where the goal came from. Imagine if it was something really serious,"" he said.""I said to the referee, 'Normally, you stop a game with a head injury'. I think he knows it. It's OK.""Of course it should have been stopped, that's the rules, isn't it? It's a big moment, imagine if there is something really dangerous. You can't run when you can't see out of your eye.""The former Denmark striker was otherwise full of admiration for his side's efforts.""I feel proud, but bitterly disappointed to lose the game,"" he told BBC Radio Lancashire.

The 18-year-old Republic of Ireland striker stretched to bring down Alexis Mac Allister's clipped pass with his left foot, set himself and then stroked the ball into the bottom corner.Ferguson burst through to score his second on 70 minutes, Solly March made it four with a diving header and Kaoru Mitoma's deflected 90th-minute strike crept in at the near post to complete the scoring.Sign up for Brighton news notificationsFA Cup: Evan Ferguson stars in Brighton victoryGrimsby had knocked out five teams from divisions above them to reach their first FA Cup quarter-final for 84 years but for all their defensive discipline in the first half, the League Two side's attacking threat was extremely limited.Brighton keeper Robert Sanchez nearly gave them a way into the game when he appeared to pick the ball up outside his area under pressure, but a VAR check concluded that the ball was just on the line when he did so.Substitute John McAtee had Grimsby's two chances of note, trying to lift the first over Sanchez and seeing the second pushed around the post by the Spaniard in the closing stages.While the margin of victory could have been greater, with Mitoma missing a gilt-edged chance and Adam Webster hitting the bar, the Seagulls can now look forward to a trip to Wembley and a first semi-final - against Manchester United - since 2019.Follow Brighton v Grimsby and all of Sunday's FA Cup actionBrighton's dream season continuesA magnificent season for Brighton goes on as they cruise into the last four of the FA Cup.It was a typically stylish performance from De Zerbi's side and yet, in the first half in particular, it was clear that they have more to offer.FA Cup: Solly March scores sensational diving header for BrightonAgainst a Grimsby team three divisions below them, they were able to play within themselves, biding their time before spotting an opening and bursting into life with two or three short, sharp passes to cut through the defence.""By this display, this Brighton side are in full flow.

An already memorable campaign could become a historic one.'Ferguson is a superstar'Although March and Mitoma were on target again and provided a constant threat down the flanks, it was Ferguson's performance that really stood out.For long parts of the game, it was an understated showing from the striker, who was not often directly involved in build-up phase play, but created space for others with his movement.However, in front of goal, he was clinical, with his first goal showcasing the finish and technique that have seen him shine in this exciting Brighton team.""This kid is a superstar. Honestly,"" said BBC pundit Danny Murphy. ""He's got great feet, technical ability. He's calm, powerful and plays the role really well. You don't see him out wide, he stays central and is always a target.""I can't see a weakness in his game at the moment.

""Credit to the lads, they've been good to me and have encouraged me when I've played.""Kelly added: ""Ferguson has gone from being a player on the periphery to leading the line for Brighton. He may even lead the line for Republic of Ireland against France in a few weeks' time.""For both club and country, there is plenty for Ferguson to look forward to in the coming weeks - and going by this performance, the Irishman is just getting started.""I think it was the manner in which he scored those goals, he was so composed,"" former Brighton striker Glenn Murray said on BBC One.

After that, it was mayhem.United making it hard for themselvesWe can never know what would have happened if Fulham had not suffered such a disastrous couple of minutes.It is beyond question, however, that up to that point, United were poor.Maybe their increasing number of below-par performances is a duel consequence of an arduous post-World Cup fixture schedule in which they have played 13 successive midweek matches (with a minimum of four more to come after the international break) plus a growing number of injuries and suspensions.The continued injury-enforced absences of Christian Eriksen and Anthony Martial has put increased pressure on others to perform. One who has risen to the challenge is Casemiro, but on Sunday the Brazilian was serving the first game of a four-match ban for his second dismissal in a matter of weeks.It is to their credit, therefore, that they keep managing to find a way to win quite so often.Fernandes, in particular, drives United on from central positions and Shaw has returned to form after a difficult few games.However, without De Gea, they may have been out.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64984201

""He will get better - he has the right coach and the right mindset. ""I have played against the greats. They are part of a special elite. The very best find it difficult to stop these guys. They keep finding a way. He looks like a superstar who is willing to improve and that is exciting to see. The goalscoring record puts you in a certain bracket - it is the hardest part of the game.""It will be City's sixth semi-final appearance in seven seasons under Pep Guardiola, and on this form few will argue against them lifting the trophy for only the second time in that period as they retain hopes of completing the Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.The draw for the FA Cup semi-finals takes place on Sunday following Brighton's tie against Grimsby Town (14:15 GMT), live on BBC One.Football Daily podcast: Conte's rant, Leeds a-leaping & another Haaland hat-trickHaaland the goalscoring machineUnstoppable Haaland lives and breathes goals - ShearerHaaland now has an incredible six hat-tricks in his debut season in English football - already half as many as brilliant Argentine Sergio Aguero scored in his ten-year City career.Considering City would play another 18 games if they reach both the FA Cup and Champions League finals, it is not beyond the realms of possibility the Norwegian will finish the campaign with about 60 goals, which has never come close to being achieved in modern times.The problem for defences is he has so many attributes.""Haaland is a beast,"" said Premier League record goalscorer Alan Shearer on Match of the Day. ""He is a goalscoring machine. He lives and breathes goals.""If he doesn't score he doesn't sleep at night. He wants another one, then another one, then another one.""He's fantastic, and this team must be a dream with the chances they create. He might get 50 goals, maybe even 60. It's bonkers.""Reaction from Manchester City's win over BurnleySign up for Man City news notificationsHis first goal owed much to his strength as goalkeeper Stefan Ortega lofted a long ball downfield. Haaland had the strength to hold off Ameen Al-Dakhil, then steered the ball back to Julian Alvarez who delivered a superb pass through the Burnley defence. Clarets keeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell left his line believing he could get to the ball first.He soon discovered Haaland is also exceptionally quick. The Norwegian beat him to it and prodded a first-time effort under the keeper.Three minutes later Haaland had his second.This time, Phil Foden delivered a low cross, which the Norwegian had the intelligence to lift over Peacock-Farrell into the net.His hat-trick goal was about being in the right place at the right time as Foden's shot bounced back off the post as Haaland lengthened his stride to apply a first-time finish.If there is a complaint, it is that Haaland is scoring too quickly. For the second game running Guardiola took him off with just over an hour played.""This guy will have a problem in the future - every game he will be expected to score three or four goals and this is not going to happen,"" said Guardiola. ""He doesn't care because he is so positive, so optimistic, never complains. The target numbers, I don't know. But if we play good, Erling will score goals.""'Verging on the ridiculous' - Haaland's FA Cup hat-trickKompany's welcome returnLosing at Manchester City is not a new experience for Burnley - they have never won at Etihad Stadium and their last victory at Maine Road came in 1963.For Kompany it must have been a strange experience, given he enjoyed so many memorable moments here and even has a statue outside the ground.He received a standing ovation when his name was read out before kick-off, with even Guardiola joining the applause.Once the whistle went, Kompany, in his distinctive cap ordered, cajoled and encouraged his team.He showed flashes of irritation when attacking moves were not carried out to his satisfaction, but he also offered praise when Burnley threatened, which they did sporadically, especially in the period before Haaland scored the opener.At the end Kompany shook hands with all the City players who were his team-mates not that long ago.He stood with fellow Belgian Kevin de Bruyne for a quiet word, possibly congratulating him for the superb pass that released Alvarez for his second, having already laid his first on a plate with a precise cross.Kompany knows his side come up against nothing like that quality in the Championship, but it does seem likely he will be back next season - when he hopes some harsh lessons from today will have been learned.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64984170

That allowed the space for Benrahma to exploit and score, with a video assistant referee (VAR) confirming Tomas Soucek had kept the ball in play.United thought they had equalised through Casemiro's header - only for it to be ruled out for offside after a VAR check.But the home side did manage to equalise in the 77th minute when Nayef Aguerd, under pressure from Wout Weghorst, headed into his own net from Bruno Fernandes' excellent corner.However, Garnacho, who also scored a last-minute winner in United's 2-1 win over Fulham in November, was the Old Trafford hero with a fine finish to put his side ahead.

Top scorer Erling Haaland was left on the bench but the majority of the Premier League champions' first-team stars were involved, including De Bruyne on his return from illness.The Belgian maestro was involved in the opener, feeding Mahrez down the right before the Algerian - who played under Bristol City boss Nigel Pearson at Leicester - found Foden who slotted home.Foden also netted against Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, which was only his second goal since the World Cup.The visitors could already have been ahead by then with Phillips crashing a 25-yard shot off the bar after just 60 seconds.They had other chances to score before the break with Ruben Dias heading straight at O'Leary and De Bruyne drilling over from inside the box.In the second half Guardiola's side eventually ran away with it, with Foden scoring his second via a Zak Vyner deflection before De Bruyne's long-range strike capped the win.Manchester City - who have only won one FA Cup under Guardiola - are still fighting for three competitions.They sit two points behind league leaders Arsenal, and drew 1-1 at RB Leipzig in the Champions League last 16 first leg.Back to Championship as Robins' unbeaten run endsThis was Bristol City's first defeat in 2023, after 12 games unbeaten since losing to West Brom on Boxing Day.But they gave their home fans reason to be proud with a battling display against their more illustrious visitors, especially at 1-0.The video assistant referee system is only in operation at Premier League grounds, meaning there was no review when Sykes went down after being clipped by Rico Lewis.Had there been VAR it could possibly have been deemed a penalty for the home side.Tomas Kalas was a colossus at the back for the Robins, with several blocks and last-ditch tackles denying their opponents.Sam Bell, who had an early shot blocked, headed wide in one of Bristol City's few second-half chances.But Manchester City's quality shone through in the latter stages. Vyner will be relieved he was not credited with an own goal for deflecting Foden's second past O'Leary.Pearson's side will now turn their focus back to the Championship, where they sit 13th, nine points off the play-offs.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64788956

We're fighting for these people who come to support us.""We started a bit tentatively but we pushed them and they finished with their strongest team really which I think is a credit to us.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64572125

The game got off to a tremendous start with Tella putting Burnley ahead after just 46 seconds.George Hirst levelled from close range just over a minute later, however.Tella won it for the Clarets in the third minute of stoppage time with a volley after a long ball forward. Burnley will host Lancashire neighbours Fleetwood Town in the fifth round on 1 March. Relive Tuesday's FA Cup actionHaving impressed in a 3-0 win over Norwich City on Saturday, Burnley boss Vincent Kompany made seven changes, while Ipswich made nine changes from the side that drew 1-1 at Cambridge United.It seemed that those changes made both sides shaky at the start - Vitinho released Ian Maatsen down the wing and found Lyle Foster before the ball fell to Tella who blasted it into the roof of the net for the opener.But the reaction was instant - a wonderful ball from Sone Aluko released Kayden Jackson, who squared the ball to Hirst for a simple finish as Town levelled. Southampton loanee Nathan Tella took his tally at Burnley to 11 goals in all competitions this seasonThe game quietened down after the frenetic start with Ipswich seeing the better of a sloppy Burnley side as Hirst, Marcus Harness and Cameron Humphreys all had half-chances. Tella forced Vaclav Hladky to tip over an effort five minutes after the break while Jackson forced a good save from Bailey Peacock-Farrell 15 minutes later following a swift Ipswich counter-attack. With 20 minutes to go, both sides made triple changes to try and up the tempo - Luke Woolfenden almost put past his own goalkeeper eight minutes later as one of Burnley's substitutes Josh Brownhill put a ball across the face of the Ipswich goal.Soon after, Tella was denied a penalty after going down under a Janoi Donacien challenge as Burnley began to create more chances. The Clarets turned the screw as seven minutes of stoppage time began - Maatsen had a shot blocked in the first minute and from the resulting corner, Johann Berg Gudmundsson forced a save from Hladky before Tella finally won it. Connor Roberts's long ball forward evaded Ashley Barnes as he and Woolfenden went up for the ball, but Tella ran in behind to fire in the winner.Burnley manager Vincent Kompany told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""I'm happy with the second half, first half was to be expected - a little bit slower.""But second half we saw some good things and I'd like to maybe score a few more in the second half, but in the end I'm really happy with the result. ""I have a lot of respect for Ipswich as a squad, it's a team that play some good football and have good intensity about them, and I knew it wasn't going to be an easy game.""We've seen players that were ready to rise to the challenge, and in the end in the second half we edged it in a deserved direction and we couldn't have done it without the squad."" Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna told BBC Radio Suffolk:""We were going to go out of the FA Cup at some time.""The way to go out is having left absolutely everything you can on the pitch and representing yourself well against a club from the higher reaches of the pyramid than you, and we managed to do that tonight. ""It's better to concede in the 94th minute than the 120th in terms of what we have coming up.""We threw everything at it, especially in the first half. Second half we had a couple of moments, but it becomes more difficult when they're bringing on the calibre of players across the pitch that they were, but we fought to the last minute, but it wasn't meant to be.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64543029

Carlos Mendes Gomes headed the only goal to decide the fourth-round replay and set up a trip to Burnley.Darren Moore's Wednesday side are top of League One and had been unbeaten in 15 games dating back to early November. Fleetwood have lost four straight games in the same division, and this was their first win against Wednesday at the sixth time of asking. Relive Tuesday's FA Cup fourth-round replaysWith half an eye on Saturday's trip to Ipswich, Moore made 10 changes from the side which beat Plymouth on Saturday, including handing a debut to 17-year-old Sean Fusire. Fleetwood bossed the early stages and the lively Promise Omochere - who scored in the 1-1 draw at Hillsborough in the initial tie - headed an early chance wide and moments later spun in the box and thudded a strike against the post with David Stockdale flat-footed. The pressure continued as Omochere headed another chance wide and fired off target following another spin. Carlos Mendes Gomes' goal secured Fleetwood's place in the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first timeFisayo Dele-Bashiru shot straight at Jay Lynch at the other end following a neat flick from Lee Gregory who then rattled the underside of the crossbar with a header just before the half-hour. Phoenix Patterson curled narrowly wide and Danny Andrew drove straight at Stockdale before the break but the hosts could not find a breakthrough for all their dominance. After a swathe of Owls changes at the break, Fleetwood had to wait until the hour to break the deadlock as Mendes Gomes rose highest to power a header from a free-kick past Stockdale. Cian Hayes saw appeals for a penalty waved away soon after but it was Moore's side who finished the stronger. Michael Smith saw a shot deflected wide, Dele-Bashiru saw penalty appeals dismissed, while Smith got in the way of a Mallik Wilks effort and George Byers fired wide as the visitors ran out of steam. Fleetwood's fifth-round game at Turf Moor will take place on either Tuesday, 28 February or Wednesday, 1 March. Fleetwood manager Scott Brown told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""We seem to like the cup. We've played an exceptional team four times now (twice in the league and twice in the FA Cup since Boxing Day). At half-time we turned around and saw the 'Land of the Giants' coming on and the big guns came on - we were a small team today but what we did do well was look after the ball.  ""I'm delighted for these lads, I've given them hell the last couple of days. I wasn't happy with the performance on Saturday (in the 3-2 home defeat by Burton) so over the last couple of days we've been working hard, watching a lot of videos, getting an understanding of how we want to play. ""On Saturday, nobody listened. Today was exceptional, every single person did their job. Balls in the box they defended with their lives.  ""I thought we dictated the game really well. The second half was always going to be a little bit deeper. From start to finish I thought the lads were exceptional. It was always going to be a hard game and they stood up to it."" Sheffield Wednesday boss Darren Moore told BBC Radio Sheffield: ""I said at half-time I wasn't happy with how we started the game. We were lacklustre in our approach and they were more on the front foot. We had a couple of goalmouth scares and (David Stockdale) has pulled off one or two saves. ""Second half we got more into the game, we had a couple of half chances that I thought we could have done better with. To lose the game in the manner that we have, from a set play, is really disappointing because it's something this season that we've taken great pride in.""The result tonight - we've only got ourselves to blame.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64543046

""I genuinely didn't feel confident until the 89th minute, and then I thought surely we can't throw this away. I was happy when I saw three minutes going up.""We knew a goal could have changed the complex of the game and the feeling in the stadium because they have some fantastic players, they are having a great season.""It's important that we go there (Southampton) as players, as a club to enjoy the day, but also we have to give a good account of ourselves while we're doing that and try to be as competitive for as long as we can.""Luton Town manager Rob Edwards told BBC Three Counties Radio:""It was three very disappointing goals, two from a throw-in and a free-kick, areas that we spoke about in the first game and we certainly prepared for.""They were very ruthless in front of goal from those moments - four shots on target and they scored three. Credit to them they deserved it and we didn't on the night.""We knew what was coming and that was the most disappointing and infuriating thing.

The game was in stoppage time by the time United felt they should have had a penalty when Norwood's shot was handled.The referee's decision to wave play on proved academic as a long clearance found Sharp on the left and he coolly slotted past Lainton.As Wrexham looked for an equaliser that would have taken the game into extra time, they were hit on the counter and Berge scored a third from close range to seal the win and bring the curtain down on Wrexham's cup adventure.Sheffield United manager Paul Heckingbottom said:""When it's tense and it's 1-1 we get that breakaway goal and I'm pleased it fell to Bill.""I've got the utmost respect for them and what they are doing and it's only a matter of time before they achieve their goals.""But it doesn't mean we were going to let them win for everyone else's fairytales. We've got to be selfish in that respect.""Credit to my players for the focus and determination to make sure we're not on the wrong end of it.""Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said:""What a performance from the lads. We were the better team I thought in the second half. ""I didn't doubt that we'd respond, I felt we would and we did. We got the penalty to get us back in it and I felt that we were the team that was going to win the game.""But the second penalty is obviously the key moment in the game. Cruelly we've lost it late but we've taken a Premiership-bound team in two games right to the wire and that's enormous credit to our lads.""The resilience of the side was outstanding.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64528369

I'm not completely ruling it out. There is a chance.""Ings' injury is one of the reasons why Moyes is reluctant to let Michail Antonio leave the club, even though the 32-year-old admitted to BBC Sport last week that it might happen.Antonio played a role in Jarrod Bowen's opener before ending his six-match scoring drought with a headed finish at the start of the second half.""I would say there is no chance,"" Moyes said of the prospect of Antonio leaving. ""Money talks in football but there is no price we are interested in taking for Mich.""The result marked the first time Moyes' side had earned successive victories since October, following on from last weekend's crucial Premier League success against Everton.And it now pits Moyes against his former club in a cup competition at Old Trafford for the third successive season, the Hammers winning in the Carabao Cup last term after losing in the last 16 of the FA Cup the year before.Defeat for League One Derby ended a 14-match unbeaten run, although manager Paul Warne knows the main challenge for his side this season is to try and return to the Championship.See FA Cup fifth-round draw hereKey man Antonio on targetMichail Antonio's goal was his first in two and a half monthsIt was a good night for Antonio as he finally ended his scoring drought.Although his current run of nine goals in 43 appearances across the end of last season and the first half of this is not enough in terms of general output, Antonio continues making the selfless runs down the channel which, if the Hammers are functioning properly, opens the space for others.That it has not happened this season is as much the fault of those supporting Antonio as the forward himself.Given his Nottingham Forest connection had been mentioned by the Derby fans early in the contest when he screwed a shot wide, there was an additional personal benefit to Antonio scoring his 67th West Ham goal.What a difference a year makesTwelve months ago to the day, thousands of Derby fans marched to Pride Park from the city centre in a show of solidarity amid genuine fears the club was going to go bust.Local businessman David Clowes eventually saved it. Clowes is the very opposite of an ego-driven owner, happy to remain in the background, even to the extent of watching the club's youth and women's team without telling anyone he is going to be there.Warne reflected on those dark times in his programme notes. Although Wayne Rooney was manager then, the former Rotherham chief told the supporters to enjoy evenings like these and think of what might have been.A trip to Old Trafford for the winner provided an added incentive but, in truth, Derby lacked the cutting edge required to really push their Premier League opponents.James Collins volleyed a first-time effort wide in the opening period, Jason Knight was also off target from the edge of the area in the second and Lewis Dobbin's angled drive near the end was comfortably dealt with by Alphonse Areola.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64448305

840,Stoke City 3-1 Stevenage: Potters progress to FA Cup fifth round,SUN 29 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"Stoke City beat Stevenage 3-1 in the FA Cup fourth roundJosh Laurent's brilliant goal helped Stoke City end Stevenage's FA Cup run and progress to the fifth round.The League Two side, who knocked out Aston Villa, hit back through Jamie Reid's equaliser after Jacob Brown had given Stoke an early lead.But Laurent put the Championship team back in front when he cut in from the right and sent an unstoppable left-footed strike into the far corner. Lewis Baker sealed Stoke's victory with a penalty. The spot-kick was controversially awarded by referee David Webb after what seemed a perfectly fair challenge on Brown by Jonathan Tomkinson. Stoke looked comfortable after an unmarked Brown had time to control the ball at the far post and fire home after Bersant Celina's third-minute corner had been flicked on by Ben Wilmot.They almost doubled their lead before the interval when ex-Stevenage defender Wilmot's header from another Celina corner was cleared off the line by Max Clark, and when keeper Taye Ashby-Hammond produced a fine save to deny Will Smallbone. Stevenage rallied in the second half and Reid forced a save from keeper Jack Bonham shortly before the visitors appealed in vain for a penalty when the ball struck Laurent's arm. The underdogs levelled when Reid, who also equalised in the third-round triumph at Villa, took advantage of some slack Stoke defending.Wilmot failed to deal with Ashby-Hammond's goal-kick and was then unable to prevent the ball crossing the line after Reid had nipped in and lobbed Bonham. However, Laurent netted in emphatic fashion three minutes later and Stevenage's hopes of another comeback were crushed by the penalty decision. 'Howard Webb, phone me' - reaction Stevenage manager Steve Evans told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""We don't get a penalty for handball - his arm was out, it's a penalty - and then he gives Stoke a penalty and it's never a penalty. It's a great challenge.""He's then watching the replay as we kick-off and is running about telling my players he got it wrong. How does that motivate my players to come back in a cup tie? Somebody needs to explain that. ""He gets it wrong - referees get things wrong, I get things wrong. We all get things wrong. Players do. But you don't run about rubbing people's face in it when there's a cup tie with 15 minutes still to go. ""The referee effectively kills the cup tie. We made some mistakes as well, but I'm proud of our efforts in the FA Cup.

Ryan Reynolds speaks on his club WrexhamWrexham manager Phil Parkinson:""The start we had, conceding a goal and losing two players, for the team to reset ourselves as well as we did I thought was outstanding.""A lesser group of players could have got beaten four or five-nil there. We had to rejig the team around and the way we regained our composure was absolutely outstanding.""We got to half-time and I believed at half-time we would get back in the game. We took the game to Sheffield United, pinned them in for long periods.""Obviously it's a real blow that we haven't got over the line, so it's mixed emotions as you can imagine.

Leeds continued to press in a lively first half that saw 18 shots, with Luis Sinisterra having a curling effort tipped on to the post.They got the second goal their excellent forward play deserved when Junior Firpo linked up brilliantly with Bamford, with the striker's dragged reverse pass allowing the left-back to slot home for his first Leeds goal.Sinisterra then sealed Leeds' comfortable passage when he opened his body and guided home Harrison's cut-back from the penalty spot. Accrington started brightly and eventually got their reward when 18-year-old substitute Leslie Adekoya scored his first senior goal with a clever dink over Illan Meslier, 38 seconds after coming off the bench.'Touch of class' - Leeds' Harrison nets 25-yard stunnerJesse Marsch's Leeds side have gone six Premier League games without victory but the FA Cup is providing solace and could add confidence that boosts their survival fight.Marsch told BBC Sport he was most pleased with Leeds' mentality, adding: ""We always have a group that are ready to work and run. The key is just that we perform clearly tactically and we get more towards the team we want to be and gather more and more results. ""This tournament will give us confidence. We know we have some tough games coming up in the Premier League but the group is feeling better and better about the progress.""Follow the rest of Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round action, plus reaction to Accrington v LeedsBamford and Harrison prove value The first half was full of chances at both ends with only a brilliant block from Maximilian Wober denying Accrington's Shaun Whalley, before January signing Georginio Rutter dragged wide from the edge of the area for Leeds.The moment of quality arrived through Harrison, whose effort was simply unstoppable. Accrington had chances to equalise, with boyhood Leeds fan Harvey Rodgers dragging wide when unmarked at the back post in the opening stages of the second period.Leeds pressed and Bamford's quality eventually told when he did superbly to hold up Firpo's pass and then turn and release the left-back. 'It had been coming' - Firpo doubles Leeds' leadThe 29-year-old striker, who has one England cap, has only managed 581 minutes this season so far but a return to fitness and form will add undoubted quality to Leeds' relegation fight. Marsch called the 75 minutes that Bamford played a ""big step"", adding: ""We were both just really happy - he was exhausted. He hasn't had that feeling in quite some time. He will be important for us.""Harrison, who has also struggled to make an impact this season with the performances of Wilfried Gnonto seeing him start on the left wing, then showed more quality when his cut-back was perfectly weighted into the path of Sinisterra. Accrington, who only booked their place in the fourth round with a replay win over non-league Boreham Wood on Tuesday, deserved their consolation goal and it was a moment that Adekoya will never forget, having previously made just seven appearances off the bench for the club. At 18 years and 285 days, he became the youngest player to score in this season's FA Cup.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64438638
843,Walsall 0-1 Leicester: Kelechi Iheanacho's deflected strike breaks hosts resistance,SAT 28 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"FA Cup:  Walsall 0-1 Leicester City: Kelechi Iheanacho sends the Foxes throughKelechi Iheanacho's fortuitous second-half strike broke the resistance of League Two Walsall and sent Leicester into the FA Cup fifth round.After Youri Tielemans had missed a penalty on a testing afternoon for a strong Foxes side, Iheanacho's effort from the edge of the box deflected off Brandon Comley and looped over Saddlers goalkeeper Owen Evans in the 68th minute.It was the Nigeria international's 17th goal in 23 FA Cup appearances - the most by any player since Iheanacho made his debut in the competition in 2016.Walsall, one of the form sides in League Two, had defended admirably against the 2021 Cup winners, cheered on by a capacity crowd at a sold-out Bescot Stadium.Evans made a series of smart saves while Tielemans struck the post with his spot-kick moments after half-time, after Patson Daka was fouled by Isaac Hutchinson.A point-blank stop from Evans denied Iheanacho a second in the final 10 minutes and kept an entertaining tie alive until the finish, but Leicester held firm for a much-needed Cup win amid their struggles in the Premier League. Cup specialist ends Walsall's resistance 'Oh dear, oh dear' - Tielemans hits the post from the spotOn paper this tie had the makings of an FA Cup upset - a Premier League team without a league win in five games, visiting an in-form fourth-tier side who had won nine of their last 12 games in a charged-up atmosphere.Walsall made the game a contest from the opening seconds by charging out of the blocks to close down the Leicester defenders. At the end their fans applauded the players from the field despite the scoreline. Leicester, whose team included James Maddison for his first start since the World Cup and a debut off the bench for £17m signing Victor Kristiansen, had been made to work.For more than an hour it looked as though wastefulness in the first half, from Daka in particular, and Tielemans' miss would cost Leicester despite domination of the ball.When needed, Walsall's defenders had thrown themselves to block shots while Evans' double save from Tielemans and Daka was particularly impressive.Unfortunately for the Saddlers, it was one of those blocks which proved crucial - Comley a little too slow to close down substitute Iheanacho.It resulted in the Foxes' second successive 1-0 win against League Two opposition in the FA Cup this season.Iheanacho, a man fast becoming an FA Cup specialist, has scored the winner on both occasions.Walsall manager Michael Flynn, who led Newport to a Cup upset against Leicester in 2019, admitted he was frustrated at the manner of the winning goal.""I am a very proud manager of the players - not just the performance but their application throughout the week,"" he said.""You almost wish they scored the penalty and not the deflected goal. It happens. I am sure we will have a bit of luck in the rest of the season.""Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said: ""We could have been more comfortable with some of the chances we missed but the attitude of the players was excellent.""There were lots of positives today as well as the result, [including] James Maddison coming back in.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64438525

""There is no room at all in society, let alone football, for that.""The Football Association confirmed it would be investigating the incident ""as a matter of urgency, working with the clubs and the relevant authorities"".A statement from Birmingham after the game said they will assist the FA and the authorities after the incident was included in the official's report.Blackburn said they would also investigate, adding that the allegation had been ""taken extremely seriously"".""The club has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of abuse and discrimination, and will take the strongest possible action against any individuals identified for committing such offences,"" Rovers said.external-linkFA Cup: Blackburn Rovers 2-2 Birmingham City- highlightsThe alleged incident and flare-up that followed on the pitch marred a hugely entertaining tie between the two Championship sides that now heads to St Andrew's to be settled.Blues, whose only win in seven games now was against Forest Green in the third round, capitalised on a poor Blackburn pass in defence to take an early lead. Khadra's skidding third-minute shot proved too much for Thomas Kaminski to keep out. The Germany Under-21 international - who is on loan from Brighton, having spent last season at Rovers - went close to a second soon after but his shot squirmed underneath Kaminski only to bobble beyond the far post.Ben Brereton Diaz twice tested Etheridge either side of that near miss from Khadra in a first half that produced numerous opportunities for both sides.While Etheridge was able to push a Rankin-Costello shot on to the woodwork, Dack was there to tap in as the rebound bounced into his path.Kaminski ensured the hosts remained level at the break, keeping out a diving header from Lukas Jutkiewicz in the final minute of the first half, but Rovers took the lead immediately after the break.Just as they squandered possession in defence to concede the opening goal, Blues did the same after the restart to allow Rankin-Costello to find the bottom corner with the outside of his boot.Jutkiewicz headed over and Khadra called Kaminski into action again as Blues searched for a leveller, while Brereton Diaz sent a big chance wide and Dack also failed to make the most of promising opportunity.The home side were made to rue those misses as James met a pass from Hannibal Mejbri to coolly slot home from 12 yards.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64438645

Sam Bell followed up his winning goal in the last round by opening the scoring for the Robins against West BromIt was almost a defensive error at the other end which got West Brom back level shortly afterwards as Jed Wallace dispossessed Rob Atkinson on the edge of the Robins box and his deflected effort looped up dangerously over Max O'Leary, but the goalkeeper reacted well to keep his side ahead. The Robins made it two shortly before the half-hour mark when Wells fed Sykes, who sent the ball across the six-yard box where Scott was waiting to score his first goal of the season.West Brom then threatened again in an entertaining first half when Daryl Dike found space for a shot across O'Leary, but the Bristol City goalkeeper was equal to it.  The hosts stretched their lead three minutes after the restart when George Tanner crossed for Bell, who took the ball down before lifting it over the diving Button with an exquisite finish for his second of the afternoon. Bell's second came courtesy of a delightful dinked finish over Baggies goalkeeper David ButtonNigel Pearson's side were full of confidence and continued to search for more goals, with Bell and Scott combining again after 71 minutes, but Button rushed out of goal to deny the former a memorable treble. West Brom went close on a number of occasions as they looked to get on the scoresheet but O'Leary denied substitute Brandon Thomas-Asante and Okay Yokuslu with excellent reflex saves to ensure the Robins made it into the fifth round. Robins manager Nigel Pearson told BBC Radio Bristol:""The result is very important of course but the fashion in which we played is also one of great encouragement for everybody. ""We've had our troubles in terms of consistency of performance this year but I think the players deserve a lot of credit for how they've been able to put together a very efficient performance against a good side. We looked dangerous throughout. ""It was quite exciting to watch but in order to do that you need a lot of discipline behind and I think that's what pleased me today, we were disciplined, we worked hard and when we had our opportunities we really made them work.""On Sam Bell:""He's in a good place and has been for a while. He's needed the chance and competition has been such that it's been hard for him to break in but now is his opportunity and he's doing everything he can to take it.""Baggies boss Carlos Corberan told BBC WM 95.6:""We made more technical mistakes today than in other games and we suffered a lot of counter-attacks. I didn't see the mentality of my team out on the pitch today. ""It's a disappointing feeling to have lost tonight and to not keep going in the competition, which was of course the target that we had. We lost the ball more today in the middle of the pitch than normal and that gives the advantage to the opponent to attack you.

846,Fulham 1-1 Sunderland: Hosts fight back to earn replay and avoid shock fourth-round exit,SAT 28 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"FA Cup 2023 Highlights: Fulham 1-1 SunderlandFulham fought back to earn a replay as they avoided a shock FA Cup fourth-round defeat at home to Championship play-off hopefuls Sunderland.Jack Clarke's early goal looked to have put a youthful Black Cats side on course for a memorable win in west London, with the winger capitalising on Issa Diop's mistake to win the ball before calmly placing his effort past home goalkeeper Marek Rodak.However, the hosts, who enjoyed the majority of possession, levelled things up just after the hour mark with captain Tom Cairney superbly evading two challenges before picking his spot in the left corner. In a dramatic conclusion, 15-year-old Chris Rigg looked to have scored the winner for the visitors but his goal was ruled out with Abdoullah Ba off-side in the build-up, while Willian's effort for the hosts was tipped over.Sunderland had looked capable of reaching the last 16 of the competition for the first time since 2015 - when they were a top-flight club - for much of the contest.However, a draw was probably a fair reflection of an end-to-end encounter which saw both sides create some excellent goalscoring opportunities.Honours even in throwback affairWhile Fulham made seven changes to their starting line-up, they still showed plenty of fluency with the ball - albeit a lack of finishing prowess when it mattered. Tosin Adarabioyo headed over from five yards and Harry Wilson spent much of the afternoon engaged in a personal duel with Anthony Patterson, with the Sunderland goalkeeper denying him on four occasions. Andreas Pereira's volley was brilliantly cleared off the line by visiting defender Dan Ballard and it looked like it might end up as a frustrating afternoon until Cairney's composed intervention. Aleksandar Mitrovic went close after coming on and fellow substitute Willian saw a fizzing effort tipped over with virtually the last kick of a frenetic encounter.""It was a typical FA Cup match,"" said Fulham manager Marco Silva. ""It was too open for a manager to like and we gave a goal too early. We created enough chances to score but gave them more chances than we would like."" Sunderland more than played their part in a what felt like a throwback match, with both sides appearing to show little caution as they pursued goals.Amad Diallo and the influential Patrick Roberts typically came to the fore for Tony Mowbray's side which contained seven players aged 22 or younger at kick-off.A superb Roberts run down the right ended with Diallo driving a near-post effort wide and the on-loan Manchester United winger also forced Rodak into two fine saves at the start of the second period prior to Fulham's equaliser.FA Cup: Fulham 1-1 Sunderland: Tom Cairney finds the net with a piece of magicPierre Ekwah and Roberts both had late chances and the only major disappointment for Mowbray was the first-half loss of their injured top scorer Ross Stewart, who was stretchered off with a suspected Achilles injury.""A team of kids came to a team that are flying in the Premier League and gave a good account of themselves,"" said Mowbray.""I am proud. They beat Chelsea here a couple of weeks ago. Our number nine went off. If Ross [Stewart] stayed on the pitch there is a fair chance some of those chances would have fallen to him and he would have finished them.

McKenna and Burnley counterpart Vincent Kompany both made three changes on the hour - the former replacing his entire front line, with top scorer Conor Chaplin and Freddie Ladapo - who both netted twice against Morecambe - and Nathan Broadhead sent on.And Kompany made another change a few minutes later as midweek signing Lyle Foster - brought in from Belgian side KVC Westerlo - made his debut in English football, but Anass Zaroury twice shot wide from decent positions as they continued to press.It was Ipswich - bidding to reach the fifth round for the first time in 16 years - who looked the more dangerous in the closing minutes as Luke Woolfenden headed over from Lee Evans' ball into the box and Chaplin hit the bar with a floated cross which rebounded into the grateful arms of Bailey Peacock-Farrell.Before the replay, Burnley will make another trip to the east of England next Saturday to face Norwich City in the league, while Ipswich will travel to Cambridge United. Ipswich head coach Kieran McKenna told BBC Radio Suffolk:""It was a big effort by the players, they did most of the things that we wanted in the game and were really difficult to play against.""They were aggressive, pressed high and played with a lot of energy and tried to play our football.""Of course, there were spells when we were having to defend, but we did everything apart from get a goal.""We had a couple of big moments we weren't able to take but we take pride in the things we did well and look forward to really good challenge at Turf Moor.""Burnley boss Vincent Kompany told BBC Radio 5 Live:""The pitch deteriorated quite quickly and it became more of a battle. But it's an FA Cup game, away, against one of the teams in form in League One and we knew it was going to be difficult, so I don't think it's too bad a result for us.""I do think we were threatening but the final ball, the final decision making [was off], but I've seen many cup games like that and quite often you might be eliminated.""For us, we've got them at home now and we'll look forward to that. We have a squad with some new guys who need game time, so it was either that [a replay] or we were going to have to organise another game anyway.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64438666

850,Southampton 2-1 Blackpool: Romain Perraud double fires Saints into FA Cup fifth round,SAT 28 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"Highlights: Perraud double sees Southampton beat BlackpoolRomain Perraud scored either side of half-time as Southampton survived a fightback by Championship strugglers Blackpool to reach the FA Cup fifth round.Perraud, on set-piece duties in the absence of captain James Ward-Prowse, broke the deadlock with a thumping effort into the far corner midway through the first half.The 25-year-old left-back doubled his and Saints' tally just after the hour mark, collecting Sekou Mara's return pass before finishing confidently past visiting goalkeeper Chris Maxwell.Blackpool, playing their first game under new manager Mick McCarthy, twice went close to cancelling out Perraud's opener but Jerry Yates and Ian Poveda both failed to make the most of good opportunities.Arsenal loanee Charlie Patino converted Yates' pass to reduce the arrears with just under 25 minutes left, but Nathan Jones' team held on.""We were in control at 2-0 but sometimes we don't do the basics right,"" Jones told BBC Sport afterwards. ""We caused our own problems.""On the whole we have been good, but today we probably made it harder for ourselves.""Saints, who are through to the fifth round for the third time in four seasons, will discover their opponents when the draw is made on Monday, 30 January. Reaction to Saturday's FA Cup gamesRomain Perraud is the first player other than James Ward-Prowse to score a direct free-kick for Southampton since Cedric Soares against Manchester United in December 2018Saints survive nervy finishComfortable winners over Nottingham Forest in the previous round, Blackpool restricted Southampton to few early opportunities but will be disappointed with the manner of Saints' opener - which McCarthy described as an ""absolute disgrace"" in his post-match interview with BBC Sport.Mislav Orsic, who was standing over the free-kick alongside Perraud, produced a dummy that appeared to catch Maxwell off guard, allowing his team-mate to slam the ball through the Seasiders' wall into the corner.The Frenchman is the first player other than James Ward-Prowse to score a direct free-kick for the club since Cedric Soares against Manchester United in December 2018.""Today I had a chance to be clinical,"" Perraud, whose four goals this season have all been at St Mary's, told BBC Sport.""It's never easy to play against this type of team. The FA Cup is a tough competition, but this is another step and it feels good for us.""The visitors responded well to Perraud's opener and were denied a first-half equaliser when Caballero produced a fingertip save to deny Yates, who was left unmarked from Poveda's pass.Some overly casual Southampton defending gifted Poveda a free run at goal early in the second half, but Caballero stood tall to save his chipped effort before watching the Blackpool attacker's follow-up sail wide of the far post.Perraud's second of the game appeared to end the Seasiders' hopes of a second successive victory over Premier League opposition, but McCarthy's team refused to give up and pulled a goal back when Patino sidefooted Yates' square pass into the net from deep inside the box.The visitors applied heavy pressure in the latter stages but were unable to make the most of a flurry of corners in second-half stoppage time.Despite his team's patchy performance, Jones will be delighted to return to winning ways after successive 1-0 defeats and can now switch his attention to Saints' Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Newcastle on Tuesday.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64438687

It's important that I could help the team go to the next round. I'm very, very happy.""After his opener Son soon doubled the advantage, turning and finishing smartly amid torrential rain.Arnaut Danjuma, signed on loan from Villarreal this week, completed the scoring after coming on as a late substitute.Tottenham assistant manager Cristian Stellini praised Son after the game, saying: ""Sonny is a great player.""He has to wait for the right moment to find the space. He was very focused on the match. He had to wait for a right time to do a good job.""Antonio Conte's side go into the draw for the fifth round, which takes place on Monday evening.Son Heung-min was one of four Spurs players to keep their starting place from the win at FulhamSpurs splutter into life at hard-working PrestonConte made seven changes to the Spurs starting XI which beat Fulham 1-0 in the Premier League on Monday, including leaving Harry Kane on the bench.Kane is aiming to become Tottenham's all-time leading scorer and is level with Jimmy Greaves on 266 goals but had been struggling with illness this week, missing training on Wednesday and Thursday.Alongside him on the bench was new signing Danjuma, but the Spurs side still contained first-teamers such as Son and Dejan Kulusevski - and they started the game on the front foot.Kulusevski had a shot brilliantly blocked by midfielder Ryan Ledson while home goalkeeper Freddie Woodman made two fine saves from long-range Son efforts.They had more than three quarters of the possession in the opening 20 minutes, however Preston grew into the game and began to restrict Spurs as the game wore on.A three-man midfield of Ledson, Ben Whiteman and Ali McCann gave Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma little time or space to create.Son quality proves the differenceIt took until the opening minutes of the second half for Preston's resolve to be broken, with Son pulling out a moment of quality to remind fans why he was the Premier League Golden Boot winner last season.His seventh of this campaign was arguably his best, as he found space 30 yards out before curling an unstoppable strike past Woodman.Preston raised their game after falling behind and gave Tottenham a much tougher test than when they last met - a 5-1 defeat in a 2009 EFL Cup meeting.However Son killed the game after 69 minutes, spinning off Jordan Storey after receiving an Ivan Perisic pass and firing past Woodman.Conte was then able to switch up his squad, including giving a debut to Danjuma - while Kane was able to remain an unused sub.And Danjuma, who signed for Spurs having appeared to be on the verge of joining Everton, scored 15 minutes into his first appearance as he turned in a low Kulusevski cross before celebrating with the away fans.Stellini added: ""We're looking forward to working with Danjuma. It's a good start for him. He's a good guy. He needs time to understand everything but it's important to start well in this type of competition.""While Spurs have reached the last 16 of the FA Cup they remain in a fight to reach their Premier League aims, trailing fourth-placed Manchester United by three points. A meeting with Manchester City next weekend could be pivotal for their ambitions.""When you look at the scoresheet it looks like a comfortable win, but the FA Cup has never been comfortable,"" Son added. ""We suffered a lot away from home. The lads did an amazing job.""There's a lot to talk about our performance, but we were focused and did what we had to do.""We can still improve so much. I think this game can give us good energy and let's move on to next weekend.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64438694

He scooped home the opening goal after racing on to Antony's incisive pass, and doubled United's lead four minutes later, curling in from the edge of the box after collecting Fred's pass.""He's done what he was brought in to do. He's a phenomenal player,"" said United captain Harry Maguire. ""You don't win what he's won without being a top player. He's improved the team, the morale, the performance and it is great to have him.""The former Real Madrid midfielder's absence was sharply felt by United during their Premier League defeat at Arsenal last weekend, and he was given a standing ovation by the home supporters who fully recognise his value to the club.""He [Casemiro] is really important with all his experience, but he is such a smart player and intelligent,"" said United manager Erik ten Hag. ""He knows the positions, how to deal with the ball and also he is creative as well, and we are really happy with him. He is important for the improvement of the team.""Any hopes Reading had of mounting a recovery were dented when Andy Carroll was sent off after picking up his second yellow card shortly before Fred backheeled in the hosts' third goal from Bruno Fernandes' cross.And although Ten Hag's side had opportunities to score a fourth, substitute Amadou Mbengue headed in a consolation for Championship side Reading from Tom Ince's corner.Casemiro and Fred show the way in front of goalCasemiro had not scored twice in a game since January 2020, when playing for Real Madrid against SevillaThe last of United's 12 FA Cup triumphs came in 2016 and Ten Hag signalled the importance he is placing on this competition by selecting a strong starting XI containing just one change from their Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg win against Nottingham Forest midweek.And there could be little doubt United deserved their victory after dominating a one-sided affair in which they initially struggled to make the breakthrough because of profligate finishing. Winger Antony was particularly wasteful with four shots in the first half, each curling effort almost a carbon copy of the previous one, all drifting wide of the far post. Fernandes twice dragged efforts across goal and wide, while Wout Weghorst, Christian Eriksen and Marcus Rashford all had opportunities to break the deadlock. When United did get the ball in the back of the net VAR came to Reading's rescue, with Netherlands forward Weghorst ruled offside before he nodded the ball in Rashford's direction, with the England striker heading in at the back post in vain.They were nearly made to pay on the stroke of half-time but goalkeeper David de Gea saved with his legs after Tyrell Malacia's error presented the ball to Junior Hoilett 10 yards out.Casemiro's quality came to the fore after the break. While he is renowned for breaking up play and his contribution in front of United's penalty area, he used his experience to drive forward from midfield and showed the nous to deliver a wonderful finish from Antony's pass. His second came from much further out as the home side penned Reading in their area, before his international team-mate Fred provided a sprinkling of samba flair with a sublime finish to ensure a comfortable passage for United.Reaction to Manchester United's win over Reading and all Saturday's FA Cup action",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64429931
853,Manchester City 1-0 Arsenal: Nathan Ake scores decisive goal as hosts edge into FA Cup fifth round,FRI 27 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"FA Cup highlights: Nathan Ake scores FA Cup winner as Man City edge ArsenalManager Pep Guardiola called Nathan Ake an ""exceptional guy"" after he sent Manchester City into the FA Cup fifth round with the winning goal in a narrow victory over Premier League title rivals Arsenal.The Gunners have established an impressive lead in the league but it was City who shaded a tight contest thanks to Ake's precise 64th-minute finish after good work from Jack Grealish. Arsenal had chances of their own, especially in the first half when City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega, deputising for Ederson, saved well from Takehiro Tomiyasu and new signing Leandro Trossard. There was little to choose between the sides and their Premier League battle will come into focus once more when they meet at Emirates Stadium on 15 February. ""We were definitely better in the second half. Arsenal have taken a step forward. It was a tight game and you realise how good a side they are,"" Guardiola said.""What a season he [Ake] is playing. He controlled one of the toughest opponents in the Premier League because Bukayo Saka is in an incredible moment. He is really good in the duels in the box, defending the far post and set-pieces is an extra bonus. ""He is an exceptional guy, there was a period where he didn't play and he never complained once. As a manager you want players like Nathan. He deserves all the good things in life.""Reaction as Manchester City beat Arsenal in the FA CupCity have the edge City will view this as a psychological blow aimed in the direction of Arsenal, who manager Pep Guardiola has publicly recognised as the biggest threat to their hopes of retaining their title. City were again short of their fluid best but have a squad so rich in quality and versatility that there is invariably a match-winning moment, on this occasion provided by Grealish's weaving run into the area and a clever finish from Ake. Erling Haaland was quiet but the fact that City got over the line against opponents who have become so formidable, and who have lost only one league game this season, will delight Guardiola. It was victory that came at a cost, however, with defender John Stones - so outstanding for his club this season and for England at the World Cup - forced off on the stroke of half-time after pulling up clutching his hamstring. Stones has been an influential presence for City and Guardiola will hope the medical bulletin does not present a long-term problem. Arsenal can be encouraged For Arsenal, this was a rare taste of defeat this season - but there was enough for manager Mikel Arteta to be encouraged by as they turn attentions back to the league. The Gunners put the shackles on goal machine Haaland, and in the first half -  with recent £21m arrival Trossard prominent - they were a real threat going forward, with Ortega the busier goalkeeper. It was all achieved with key men Martin Odegaard, Oleksandr Zinchenko, William Saliba, Gabriel Martinelli and goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale held back from the starting line-up. Arsenal pushed to the end and it required real bravery from Ortega to keep them at bay in tight goalmouth situations. ""I think we could have got much more out of the game,"" Arteta told ITV. ""We had big situations in the game and we didn't put them away. We can take a lot of positives, I think the way we approached the game and competed. It is really difficult to win against this team but we went head to head with them.""In the big moments, in big matches, you have the make the difference. That is how you win these games.""While Arteta will be hurt by the defeat there was plenty in Arsenal's performance to not regard this as too much of a setback. Neither manager drawing conclusionsGuardiola and Arteta were not drawing too many conclusions from the first big battle between the clubs this season when they spoke to the media afterwards.Both will take away a measure of satisfaction, City with another FA Cup win to follow up their third-round victory against Chelsea, while Arteta's understandable disappointment in defeat will be tempered somewhat by a good performance. On the downside, both managers were left to rue injuries to key men. Arsenal will hope Thomas Partey's rib injury, which requires a scan, will not prove a major problem for the hugely influential midfield man - although it is likely to increase their urgency to conclude a deal for Brighton's Moses Caicedo, having had a £60m bid turned down. City's worry will be around Stones, who came off late in the first half with a hamstring injury. Guardiola has strength in that central defensive department but Stones has been one of his outstanding and consistent performers this season. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64417476

The striker made it three goals in two substitute appearances since he returned from injury.Leeds gifted Championship strugglers Cardiff two consolations as Luke Ayling's mistake allowed Callum Robinson to head in unchallenged, before a Marc Roca handball - spotted by VAR - enabled the same player to slot in a spot-kick.Jesse Marsch's side will travel to fifth-tier Boreham Wood or League One Accrington Stanley in round four on the weekend of 28/29 of January.Those two sides were due to meet in a third-round replay on Tuesday, but this was postponed because of a frozen pitch, with the rescheduled game set to take place on Tuesday, 24 January.Best action and reaction from Leeds v Cardiff in the FA Cup.Gnonto the shining light for LeedsLeeds United don't do home FA Cup ties, at least not in recent years. This was their first since January 2016 and only because they salvaged a late draw in Wales 10 days ago.A sell-out crowd was testament to how long these fans have waited for the world's oldest cup competition to return to LS11 and they were treated to something special before many of them had taken their seats.FA Cup - Leeds 3-0 Cardiff City: Wilfried Gnonto caps off team move with composed finishWhen Gnonto joined Leeds, boss Marsch suggested he was ""not Premier League ready"", but from the moment he stepped onto a pitch in England he has set about proving the American wrong.His first goal was something out of the highest of drawers - an audacious and superbly-executed volley in mid-air - similar to that performed by another Italian Paolo di Canio for West Ham against Wimbledon in 2000, albeit from closer range.Gnonto's second was a more routine finish, but underlined the brilliant anticipation, movement, speed and maturity of a player that is rapidly making his £4m fee look an absolute steal.Sandwiched between the two was another fine goal from Rodrigo, who saw his tag as Leeds' record signing taken away by the capture of Georginio Rutter last week, but now has 12 goals in 20 games this season.If Rutter can live up to the hype, a forward line of the 20-year-old Frenchman, the experienced Spaniard and teenage Italian, with Englishman Bamford competing with them, promises much for Leeds in the second half of the season.Wednesday's victory was most significant for boss Marsch, who has come under increasing pressure following a run of just two victories in 17 games.The Whites looked to be finding form before the World Cup break, but they have struggled for consistency since the restart, with performances showcasing encouraging attacking play but dire defensive lapses costing them points.This was the case in the original tie in Wales, in which Leeds were the better side over the entirety of the game but had to rely on a second-half comeback from 2-0 down and an injury-time equaliser from substitute Sonny Perkins to force a replay.This was a much more confident display, following on from the high-energy attacking effort they demonstrated at Aston Villa on Friday.FA Cup Replays - Leeds 5-1 Cardiff: Patrick Bamford brace in FA Cup third round victoryIt wasn't perfect, with those clumsy concessions, chances wasted and the offside flag sparing blushes following the failure to effectively clear the corner from which Nelson headed in just before half time.But it is something on which to build ahead of what is an even more crucial game - and bigger test - for the Whites and their manager at home to Brentford in the Premier League on Sunday.Cardiff were second best, but at least left with something on the board through Robinson's double - and can now fully focus on their own dire league situation.In between the two cup ties with Leeds, they sacked manager Mark Hudson after just 118 days in charge following nine games without victory.That run is now into double figures and needs to be arrested quickly, whether it is Whitehead still in charge for the league visit of Millwall on Saturday or not.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64262062

And, although three of them were cup-tied, they got off to a great start, fuelled by Stevenson's rocket.The former Wolves and Coventry youngster had previously scored only once for Forest Green - in this season's EFL Trophy at Newport since his arrival from Colchester in the summer of 2021.But when he received the ball in space, 25 yards out, he delivered a superb right-foot curler into the top right corner for his first goal at the New Lawn.Forest Green scorer Ben Stevenson had never scored at the New Lawn beforeAnd the lead would then have been doubled, had home skipper Baily Cargill's shot not been tipped over by the recalled Neil Etheridge.He was one of five changes from the side beaten 4-2 by Bristol City on Saturday - Blues' fourth straight league defeat - along with on-loan duo Manny Longelo and Hannibal Mejbri, Wales midfielder Jordan James and veteran striker Jutkiewicz.And the Championship side were somewhat muted, failing to land a blow before the break. But, after a triple half-time substitution involving Tahith Chong, Alfie Chang and Max Colin, the visitors suddenly looked a team transformed.First top scorer Scott Hogan was denied only by a fine, full-length save from Lewis Thomas. Then just two minutes later Jutkiewicz drilled home a low right-foot shot from the edge of the box for only his second goal of the season.But, just past the hour, Blues survived a double scare in a frantic scramble when Etheridge twice came to the rescue. First he touched Regan Hendry's left-foot shot onto the bar before also heroically denying Matty Stevens from the rebound.Birmingham keeper Etheridge's incredible triple saveWithin four minutes, Blues were ahead as Long kept his head to slot home in a packed penalty area melee - and that booked the former Burnley man the enticing prospect of a trip to Ewood Park on 28 January.Forest Green boss Ian Burchnall told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: ""We were outstanding first half and thoroughly deserved to go in ahead. But we didn't get that elusive second goal.""Then they changed their shape at half-time and it took us 10 minutes to get to grips with it.""They took their two chances and we didn't take ours. And you can't do that against a side from that level with that sort of quality. It's a simple as that.""We'd love to have made it to the fourth round for the first time. But it was still a good night. The fans were great. When they give us support like that, it gives us a real boost.""Birmingham City boss John Eustace told BBC Radio WM: ""The first half was difficult for us. We weren't aggressive. We weren't on the front foot. And to be 1-0 down at Forest Green is as tough as it gets.""But the changes at half-time were positive and worked. The subs made a huge difference. Alfie Chang in particular did really well. ""And what a world-class double save that was from Neil Etheridge. He hasn't stopped talking about it for 20 minutes - and he's got every right to, to be fair.""Most importantly, the second half showed we're together. When you're going through a difficult period, as we are, it's so important to show the character that we have. Let's hope that's now a turning point for us.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64252794

Swansea had chances to triumph, but it was academy product Bell's night.The 20-year-old ran from near halfway to score a memorable first senior goal for his home-city club. Bell's intervention secured a second successive win for Bristol City, a welcome boost after a run of just one victory in 12 matches in all competitions.Swansea had lost only once in four games before this - against Championship leaders Burnley - but saw any hope of a cup run wiped out as they failed to take their chances. While the Welsh club's focus for the rest of the season will be a play-off push, the Robins can look forward to a home cup tie against West Bromwich Albion later this month.Swansea had been left ruing their failure to win this tie at Ashton Gate nine days ago having dominated the first half, though Antoine Semenyo had deservedly cancelled out Joel Piroe's goal to set up the replay.While Russell Martin made seven changes for a game he felt Swansea could have done without, Nigel Pearson kept faith with the Bristol City team who started in the league last weekend - and was ultimately rewarded.It was hard to tell which of the bosses had shuffled their pack in an even first half where chances were at a premium.Olivier Ntcham had the one shot on target, a 20-yard drive which was gathered by Max O'Leary, although the Bristol City goalkeeper reacted quickly to prevent an own goal when Zak Vyner sliced towards his own net.The visitors' first chance came when the ball ricocheted to Semenyo early in the second half - only for the Ghana international to slash wide.Swansea responded, Joel Latibeaudiere forcing a sprawling save from O'Leary before Piroe shot across the face.The hosts were exerting real pressure for the first time when Bristol City snatched the lead, with Joe Williams winning possession and feeding fellow substitute Bell.He threaded a pass through for Sykes, who got to the ball well before Swansea goalkeeper Andy Fisher and rolled in his third goal in two games. Ollie Cooper celebrates his sixth goal of the seasonSuddenly the game opened up, with Williams chipping tamely into Fisher's arms before Swansea levelled when Matt Grimes' cross reached the far post and Cooper, who had been on the pitch for a matter of seconds, was left with the simple task of sidefooting into the net.Swansea came close in extra time through Luke Cundle's wasteful header and a Ryan Manning volley which was pushed over by O'Leary.Then came Bell's big moment, his pace carrying him away from Ben Cabango before he cut inside and shot high into the net. Swansea City head coach Russell Martin:""I'm just really frustrated we haven't won it. I feel like it's the same sort of answer I've given you a lot of times. We need more in the final third. They had so little until they scored.""I was really pleased with the performance. We made seven changes, the game didn't look any different, we were so dominant. ""We needed to show more for the dominance. We give away a poor goal in the middle of the pitch. Their game plan has probably worked really well, Nigel [Pearson] will say.""I'm so pleased with the players, they gave everything, they dominated for so long, but we need to make more of it because we only score one goal with the amount of entries we had in the box."" Bristol City manager Nigel Pearson: ""I am pleased for us to get into the next round. It was a tough game - we knew it was going to be. We went with an unchanged side and we knew we would have to make changes during the game.""It was a super goal to win it, a great finish. We just hoped he would get the chance. ""I thought all the substitutes had an impact on the game. They created a few opportunities for sure, Max [O'Leary] made a couple of good saves, but we always felt we would get some opportunities and it's then whether you can take them.

The visitors came into the game off the back of a defeat by West Brom in the Championship where they squandered a two goal lead to lose 3-2.Any hangover from that disappointment appeared to be gone and Rob Edwards' side started confidently at the DW Stadium, dominating possession and pressuring Wigan off the ball.Both Adebayo and defender Reece Burke had early chances with free headers inside the box but neither could seriously test goalkeeper Ben Amos.With snow starting to fall during the match, James Bree attempted to place a free-kick from 25-yards-out into the top corner for the Hatters, but sent the ball over the bar.Aasgaard had the only real scoring opportunity for the home side in the first half when a poorly cleared ball landed at his feet on the edge of the penalty area but he rushed his strike and dragged it wide.The Latics would end the half strongly creating more opportunities but the game remained goalless at the break.Less than a minute after the restart, Norway Under-20 international Aasgaard smashed a volley from outside the box into the roof of the net to break the deadlock and put Wigan in front.Luton's response was almost immediate and five minutes later Woodrow found the equaliser.

It was a game I thought we had lots of control in. We were expecting that. I thought we started really well.

""We had to fight hard at the end but we controlled the game for long periods. It's great and the reaction we wanted to see.""Tuesday's triumph was Liverpool's third since the resumption of domestic football after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. A 3-2 League Cup loss at Manchester City on 22 December was followed by hard-fought victories over Aston Villa and Leicester in the Premier League, before humbling defeats at Brentford and Brighton either side of the 2-2 draw with Wolves at Anfield.""We had a few man-of-the-match performances today,"" Klopp continued. ""We played a really good first half, had good periods in the second and in the end it was just about passion to block the shots.""Wolves' improvement under Julen Lopetegui has been clear to see but the home side failed to seriously threaten Caoimhin Kelleher's goal until late on, when Ruben Neves, Raul Jimenez and Matheus Cunha all went close to an equaliser.Wolves sign Spain winger Sarabia from PSG for £4.4mReaction to Liverpool's FA Cup win at MolineuxLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsGo straight to all the best Wolves contentReds deliver perfect responseFA Cup 2023: That was the reaction we wanted - KloppThere was a brief stoppage in play within the first minute due to a power cut inside the stadium, but Liverpool's visiting supporters did not have to wait much longer for teenager Elliott to light up Molineux with a goal of the highest quality.The 19-year-old - one of eight changes from Saturday's loss at Brighton - collected a pass from Thiago Alcantara, advanced unchallenged into the Wolves half and unleashed a ferocious 30-yard effort which sailed over the dive of goalkeeper Jose Sa and into the net.The goal appeared to settle Liverpool, who continued to attack with pace and intensity while forcing the hosts into errors in possession.Fabio Carvalho had the ball in the Wolves net again 10 minutes before half-time, but the former Fulham forward was in an offside position from Naby Keita's through-ball and the goal was disallowed.Wolves' best opportunity of the first half fell to the lively Adama Traore, who raced on to Neves' pass but failed to hit the target from a tight angle.Lopetegui introduced Matheus Nunes and Nelson Semedo at half-time in an effort to give his team fresh impetus, but the hosts continued to labour in the final third until Cunha and Daniel Podence entered the fray with 25 minutes remaining.Jimenez and Cunha both failed to hit the target from promising positions, before the latter sent a tame header into Kelleher's arms from deep inside the penalty area. Fellow second-half substitute Curtis Jones missed an opportunity to double Liverpool's advantage when he dragged a shot just past the far post in the 90th minute, but the holders held on for a first clean sheet in eight games and a place in the fourth round.""It's not easy playing against Liverpool, but in my opinion we deserved more from the second half,"" Lopetegui said.

Not one of them was really them carving us open.""They are a very good Championship team, and you saw that from the quality they had. But we look back at the four goals, they are ones we have given them on a plate and haven't them defended well at all.""It's all about the score and we've got no qualms.""You can't afford to defend like that, and it's a shame because we brought so many supporters and we hoped it was written in the stars to cause an upset.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64252866
861,Oxford United 0-3 Arsenal: Eddie Nketiah scores twice as Gunners progress,MON 09 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"FA Cup highlights: Oxford United 0-3 ArsenalArsenal boss Mikel Arteta believes Eddie Nketiah is getting better and better after helping the Gunners set up an FA Cup fourth-round tie at Manchester City by beating Oxford United at Kassam Stadium. Nketiah scored twice in six second-half minutes after Mohamed Elneny's opener to secure the Gunners' progression.It is now five goals in his last six games for Nketiah, who has stepped up in the absence of injured striker Gabriel Jesus. ""He showed great composure,"" said Arteta. ""He's a great finisher, with the timing of his runs as well.""He showed his quality and his work-rate is getting better and better. I'm really happy with him.""We have only one [striker] and to go many months before Gaby is back it's not easy, but we have to get the most out of the players that we have at the moment.""The Premier League leaders were frustrated in the first half by a well-organised and disciplined Oxford side before eventually overpowering their League One opponents. Fabio Vieira was Arsenal's creator-in-chief, sending in a perfect free-kick for Elneny to head past Oxford goalkeeper Eddie McGinty in the 63rd minute before playing a perfect pass for Nketiah to finish calmly finish seven minutes later. Oxford, who had battled so hard, were now struggling to cope with Arsenal's attacking threat and Nketiah was on the mark again after 76 minutes with a delicate chip over McGinty from Gabriel Martinelli's pass to confirm that powerhouse meeting with City at Etihad Stadium. There was concern for Arsenal before Sunday's north London derby with Tottenham when Bukayo Saka went off with an injury, but Arteta played down the seriousness of it.""He's fine,"" he told ITV Sport. ""He'll be OK.""Reaction to Oxford United's FA Cup tie with ArsenalArsenal get the job done Arteta will have been disappointed by the Gunners' sterile first-half performance but once they clicked into gear they inevitably had too much for Oxford. Nketiah and Vieira were the two stars of the show, the latter coming through a struggle in the first half to show his quality in delivery and passing as the Premier League side finally exerted their authority. Vieira's free-kick was the perfect invite for Elneny to break the deadlock with a powerful close-range header and his pass for Nketiah to round McGinty was just as good. Nketiah showed his class in front of goal with his third as he continued to deputise so well for the injured Jesus. Arsenal were not exactly sparkling but that is not the priority in these games. It is getting into the next round and they achieved it with something to spare, Oxford not creating a serious moment of danger in the game. The visitors increased the tempo and urgency after the break and once Elneny put them ahead there was never going to be a shock. Oxford can take heart despite defeat Oxford's hopes of creating an FA Cup shock to stand alongside Stevenage's win at Aston Villa on Sunday did not materialise but Karl Robinson's side can take plenty away from this match despite defeat. They were untroubled for the first half but the major problem for Oxford was they did not possess any threat of their own in the attacking areas and Arsenal goalkeeper Matthew Turner, in for the rested Aaron Ramsdale, had a very quiet night. To Oxford's credit, they tried to maintain their passing style and were well-drilled throughout the first half when Arsenal could not make any inroads. It was also a night for Oxford's fans to send a message off the pitch with a huge banner behind the goal reading ""SOS Support Our Stadium. Secure Our Future. 24/01/23"". This was a reference to plans to build a new stadium and move away from the Kassam, which will be discussed by Oxford council officials on 24 January and which the club regard as vital if they are to have a more prosperous future.

The visitors were dominant in the first half but Semenyo's goal was deserved as the Robins dominated after half-time.Semenyo headed home with 15 minutes remaining as Swansea failed to clear.The visitors had been gifted the lead on 15 minutes when Rob Atkinson's awful pass went straight to Liam Cullen, who presented Joel Piroe with a tap-in. The winners of the replay will host Chesterfield or West Bromwich Albion in the fourth round.Swansea and Bristol City's bosses might feel frustrated not to have settled the tie on the day, with Swansea completely in control before the break but unable to add to the goal the hosts gifted them.Bristol City have only progressed from four of their last 15 FA Cup third-round ties, but they will take heart ahead of the replay at the Swansea.com Stadium from the fact they have never been knocked out by the Swans, progressing against the Welsh side three times. Pressure on PearsonRobins manager Pearson - who admitted this week he is under pressure to keep his job - unsurprisingly named a strong side, with just one change from the league draw with Coventry, with Tommy Conway replacing Nahki Wells, though Conway was withdrawn with injury after 25 minutes.Swansea boss Russell Martin also opted to make just one change from the defeat to Burnley last time out, with Nathan Wood coming in for Harry Darling.Attention has been focused on Pearson with his side winning just one of their last 10 league games and he would have been aghast at the way they conceded the first goal.They provided Swansea with an absolute gift as Atkinson's wayward pass was intercepted by Cullen, who gave Piroe the easiest of finishes. Atkinson thought he had made amends at the end of the first period, but his strong claim for a penalty was waved away by referee Craig Pawson.Pawson also rejected Alex Scott's penalty plea after the break as the hosts increased the pressure on the visitors.Pearson's side had not won any of their seven previous home games, with their last success at Ashton Gate coming in August, but they showed good spirit, despite creating few chances.The hosts found an equaliser with 15 minutes remaining as Semenyo's header beat goalkeeper Steven Benda, who got his hands to the ball.The momentum was all with the Robins and Benda saved adroitly to deny Wells as the home fans sensed a winner.Both sides had chances to avoid a replay but Max O'Leary saved Jay Fulton's powerful effort and Joe Williams' superb cross somehow evaded everyone in the Swansea penalty area.Bristol City manager Nigel Pearson said:""There were two penalty decisions which went against us in the first half when first Antoine Semenyo and then Rob Atkinson went down. I have no idea why.""Then in the second half, every time balls were played into the box, they were allowed to grab our players and pull them to the ground.""Rob Atkinson dealt with his mistake well. He didn't dwell on it and I couldn't fault the efforts of any player.""Going to the World Cup with Ghana was good for Antoine Semenyo. He had only just recovered from a broken shin at the start of the season, so missed much of the build-up.""Swansea City head coach Russell Martin told BBC Sport Wales:""We were brilliant in the first half. Some of our build-up play was incredible.""But we need to make more of the moments when we get into the opposition box. The boys were in a bit of a rush at times and there was a lack of quality.""They had a couple of penalty shouts, but I was really pleased with our composure at the back, which limited them to very few chances.""We spoke at half-time about the need to retain the same intensity. But Bristol changed shape, threw caution to the wind, and we didn't play with enough aggression to hold on.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64143538

And the defender was quick to threaten for the fast-starting visitors, forcing Joe Wildsmith to make an excellent early save with a glancing near-post header from a corner.Dobbin clipped the bar with Derby's first effort of the game in the 24th minute after meeting a neatly clipped Barkhuizen cross.From that moment on, the Rams dominated what remained of the half.Still, it was not until after the Tykes lost Edwards to a serious looking leg injury that the hosts took the lead from the spot, with Collins sending Walton the wrong way from the spot after Wolfe handled a corner from Barkhuizen. Barnsley's inability to clear danger at the top of the box on the hour mark allowed the ball to break kindly for Barkhuizen, who turned on edge of the area before beating the keeper with a powerfully-struck shot.A day of disappointment for Barnsley ended with a defensive error that led to Derby's third.Nathaniel Mendez-Laing was first gifted the ball, and while Walton did well to keep him out, the rebound found the forward again before he rolled a pass for Knight to slot home.'Derby take a lot of confidence from win' - reactionDerby County boss Paul Warne:""I thought for the first 15, 20 minutes Barnsley were superior to us, they won all the second balls and Joe pulled us out really with a save from a corner that kept us in the game.""As the game progressed we got better and the midfielders got to grips, and I thought in the second half we were really good, we had a real energy about us and the lads should take a lot of confidence from the game.""I don't think the scoreline flattered us, however, it is a good warning sign. It's always great to win and learn, and what I think we've learnt in the dressing room was we were just a little bit complacent in our start.""Barnsley manager Michael Duff:""We lost every duel, every header and gave poor goals away, so it's not a great combination which is why we got beat.""They've got good players, we've got good players, but when you get outfought and outrun then that's the result that happens.""There are mitigating circumstances. We've got an issue with the penalty, we think the second goal was offside and then we hand them a third goal - but they've outscrapped us.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64203544

Boreham Wood or Accrington Stanley await Cardiff or Leeds in the fourth round after a cruel end to the game for the Bluebirds, who looked set for a first victory in eight games, which would have offered respite from their league struggles.As for Leeds, Perkins' late leveller is a lifeline for manager Jesse Marsch, whose side have now gone six matches without a win in all competitions. A defeat here would have severely increased the pressure on the American.Bagan sent off for handball but Leeds miss penalty This fixture invoked memories of then third-tier Cardiff's 2002 FA Cup triumph over an expensively-assembled Leeds side who were top of the Premier League at the time.Since that landmark result, Cardiff had won 14 of the 22 subsequent meetings between the sides but, given their struggles in the Championship this season, confidence was in short supply in the Welsh capital.Leeds were on a winless run of their own - five matches in all competitions - and also of concern for Marsch's men was their recent wretched FA Cup record, losing at the third-round stage in each of the past five seasons, including shock defeats by Newport County and Crawley Town.Marsch said he had spoken with chief executive Angus Kinnear about the subject, and Leeds fans clearly fancied a cup run, selling out their allocation of 6,000 and creating a din which drowned out the home crowd for long periods.The Leeds players looked similarly motivated as they controlled the opening exchanges, Darko Gyabi impressing in midfield with an early shot going narrowly wide and a weaving run which ended with an effort well blocked by Jack Simpson.But despite the visitors' early control, it was Cardiff who took the lead against the run of play. Tom Sang freed Mark Harris with a fine through-ball and, after his shot was saved by Joel Robles, Harris teed up Isaak Davies. His shot was also blocked but the ball fell to Philogene, who fired in from close range.Having scored a mere 20 goals in 26 league games this season, the Championship's lowest scorers made it two in seven minutes against their Premier League opponents.The second was an altogether classier affair, with Andy Rinomhota's delightful lofted pass glancing the head of Leeds centre-back Diego Llorente before reaching Ojo, who chested the ball before finishing smartly on the turn.FA Cup: Sheyi Ojo extends Cardiff City's leadLeeds were booed off at half-time and their fans' ire had the desired effect after the restart as their team put Cardiff under constant pressure with a flurry of chances.First, Pascal Struijk headed inches wide before top scorer Rodrigo, recently on as a substitute, rose to meet Sam Greenwood's cross and head into the net despite a touch from Alnwick.Rodrigo fired another shot over before playing a leading role in one of the game's decisive moments.The penalty was as blatant as they come - Bagan diving like a goalkeeper to push Junior Firpo's goal-bound shot away with his hand - but Rodrigo's weak spot-kick was saved by Alnwick.Cardiff fans celebrated the save with newfound belief that their side were about to claim another FA Cup scalp but it was Leeds' noisy travelling contingent who had the last laugh as Perkins helped Firpo's flick into the net to spark wild celebrations behind that goal and force a replay.FA Cup: Sonny Perkins scores equaliser against Cardiff",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64143545

Stoke's passing and movement was crisp and sharp and, mentally, they were probably two yards in front of us - but we knew that.""It was a great experience for some of the academy players to get on the pitch and be involved in the training and preparation.

868,Aston Villa 1-2 Stevenage: League Two side produce stunning late comeback,SUN 08 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"Stevenage stun Villa with dramatic late comebackLeague Two Stevenage produced an incredible late comeback to stun Premier League Aston Villa at Villa Park and reach the FA Cup fourth round.The visiting players and manager Steve Evans celebrated with their supporters at full-time after two goals in the final two minutes clinched a magnificent victory.Substitute Dean Campbell fired in a superb 90th-minute winner after Jamie Reid's equaliser from the penalty spot - the spot-kick awarded after last man Leander Dendoncker was shown a straight red card for bringing down Campbell.Morgan Sanson's first goal for Villa had given Unai Emery's side a half-time lead over a side ranked 59 places below them in the football pyramid.But the hosts, despite their overall superiority, were unable to extend their advantage and they were made to pay in a remarkable conclusion to the match.Fourth tier Stevenage's reward is a trip to Championship outfit Stoke City in the fourth round, which takes place from 27 to 30 January.The FA Cup fourth round draw in fullFA Cup third round action reactionVilla unravel as Stevenage cause huge upsetCelebrations as Stevenage stun Aston Villa in FA Cup For 84 minutes, it all appeared rather straightforward for Aston Villa.But their bid to end their worst ever FA Cup losing run - which extends to an eighth match - unravelled from the moment Dendoncker was dispossessed on the edge of his own box and grabbed the shirt of Campbell.Referee Graham Scott appeared to initially award a free-kick but then produced a red card and pointed to the spot, allowing a video assistant referee review to confirm the penalty.Reid held his nerve to send Robin Olsen the wrong way and put Stevenage on course for a replay - a feat which would have been a fantastic achievement on its own.But the League Two side were not done yet and some quick thinking from Jake Reeves to pass his corner to Campbell resulted in the 21-year-old Scot drilling a shot into the bottom corner and sending the away fans into raptures.Villa have now progressed from just one FA Cup tie since reaching the 2015 final. Stevenage, meanwhile, are the first fourth tier side to beat a Premier League team in an away FA Cup tie for four years.Wasteful Villa made to payA manager with a rich history in cup competitions, four-time Europa League winner Emery made his intentions clear this week as he announced he was preparing his side for this match with the objective of ""winning the FA Cup"".Five years after he joined Barcelona in a £142m move from Liverpool in January 2018, Brazilian Philippe Coutinho started among eight changes from Villa's midweek Premier League draw with Wolves.The hosts dictated from the start - they ended the match having averaged 78.6% possession - but Douglas Luiz's long-range effort was the only test for goalkeeper Taye Ashby-Hammond before Stevenage offered their first warning.Campbell hits late winner as Stevenage stun VillaLuke Norris was unlucky to marginally mistime his run before he provided a great assist to set up Danny Rose for what the visitors momentarily believed was a shock opener.An intricate passing move produced Villa's opener, Ings teeing up Frenchman Sanson for his first goal for the club, but Stevenage stuck to their task and almost had a stunning equaliser when Norris skimmed the top of the crossbar with an excellent curled attempt.They continued to defend resolutely as Villa increased the pressure after the break. Perhaps too keen to impress in his first start under Emery, the misfiring Coutinho left the field after 65 minutes, having had a match-leading five attempts but landing just one on target.There had been little to suggest the match would end as it did. After all, Stevenage scored with their only two shots on target. But what unfolded will live long in the memory of the 3,000 travelling fans present to witness a truly memorable fightback.

869,Manchester City 4-0 Chelsea: Riyad Mahrez scores twice as sorry Blues thrashed in FA Cup,SUN 08 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"Man City score four to knock out ChelseaManchester City cruised into the FA Cup fourth round with a routine victory over a desperately poor Chelsea at Etihad Stadium.This was a far cry from what has traditionally been a hugely competitive meeting between two Premier League giants as City wrapped up a tie with either Oxford United or Arsenal in the next round by the interval.City's win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Thursday was hard-fought but this was a stroll, Riyad Mahrez setting them on their way with a brilliant 23rd-minute free-kick before World Cup winner Julian Alvarez scored a second from the spot seven minutes later following Kai Havertz's handball. Phil Foden scored City's third after 38 minutes, turning in Kyle Walker's cross after he had been played in by Thursday's match-winner Mahrez, who got his second from the spot late on after Kalidou Koulibaly clumsily bundled Foden to the floor. It was a chastening day for Chelsea, boss Graham Potter and their travelling support, who chanted the name of Thomas Tuchel, the Champions League-winning manager sacked by new owner Todd Boehly in September.Man City will face Arsenal or Oxford in FA Cup fourth roundFA investigates alleged homophobic chants at Man CityRelive Manchester City v Chelsea and Sunday's other FA Cup third-round tiesChelsea fans turn up heat on PotterChelsea's supporters gave their team a sympathetic reception at the end of Thursday's narrow Premier League defeat by City at Stamford Bridge but this was not the case here. Potter's team were roundly booed at half-time and again by those who stayed until the end, with the manager hearing the uncomfortable sound of his own fans singing the name of his popular predecessor Tuchel. Chelsea's lack of threat was also reflected in ironic shouts of ""shoot"" every time they got near goal and chants of ""we've had a shot"" on the rare occasions they did. This may be a club in transition once again but this display was abject under any circumstances. Manager Potter is wrestling with an injury crisis but there was no excuse for this dreadful performance. Chelsea's side contained plenty of experience with players such as Mateo Kovacic, Koulibaly, Havertz, Mason Mount, Jorginho, Hakim Ziyech and keeper Kepa. Graham Potter's Chelsea side did not register a single shot in the first half of their FA Cup defeat at Manchester CityChelsea lacked fight, quality and belief, an alarming sight for a manager so early in his reign and given the spending lavished on this season, admittedly in a somewhat scattergun fashion, by owner Boehly since his arrival. They have now been knocked out of both domestic cups by City and stand 10 points off the Champions League places in the Premier League. Chelsea face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League last-16 and if they perform like this they will also be knocked out there. Troubled times for Chelsea and manager Potter.Man City make it look easy Manchester City strolled through the second half barely breaking sweat after smoothly putting Chelsea away in the first 45 minutes, underlining the gulf in class between the teams. Pep Guardiola was able to rest goal machine Erling Haaland but replaced him with Argentina World Cup hero Alvarez, while Foden got his chance to remind everyone once again what a huge part he will play in Manchester City's future. City's third goal was passing and movement perfection, Foden rounding off the link between Mahrez and Walker, the fist pumps and smile of delight from Guardiola confirming this is exactly how he likes to see his side playing. This has been a satisfying few days for Manchester City as they closed the gap on leaders Arsenal in the league to five points - and they may face the Gunners again in the FA Cup fourth round unless League One Oxford United can spring a surprise at the Kassam Stadium on Monday.

870,Crystal Palace 1-2 Southampton: Adam Armstrong scores winner in FA Cup third round,SAT 07 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"Southampton beat Palace after goalkeeper errorAdam Armstrong capitalised on a second-half error by Crystal Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita to earn Southampton a place in the FA Cup fourth round.Guaita's attempted clearance was charged down by Armstrong, who was left with a simple finish.Odsonne Edouard had put Palace ahead, but James Ward-Prowse equalised with a free-kick that was intended as a cross.Armstrong completed the turnaround 22 minutes from time at Selhurst Park. Southampton manager Nathan Jones, whose only previous win since replacing Ralph Hasenhuttl in November came against League One Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup, said: ""I'm delighted with the overall performance.""It's been a tough week, but the response has been fantastic.""We started a bit edgy, but we showed real zest after that and showed the side we can be. We tweaked a few things at half-time and came out aggressively.""Saints dig deep to progressPalace manager Patrick Vieira fielded a strong team, restoring Edouard and Will Hughes to the side in the only changes from Wednesday's 4-0 Premier League defeat by Tottenham.The Eagles were by far the more accomplished outfit in the early stages, with Zaha denied by Lyanco's sliding challenge before having a fierce effort deflected wide by Duje Caleta-Car.Palace's talismanic winger turned provider moments later, releasing Edouard to open the scoring with a low finish beyond keeper Gavin Bazunu.Southampton, who made five changes to the team that suffered a sixth successive league defeat against Nottingham Forest in midweek, lacked cohesion and were fortunate not to fall further behind when Jordan Ayew rattled the crossbar from Michael Olise's low cross.There were audible boos from the travelling supporters midway through the first half as Southampton struggled to breach the Palace defence, but they restored parity out of nothing when Ward-Prowse's inswinging delivery evaded everyone and snuck inside the far post.Clear-cut opportunities were few and far between in a more even start to the second period. Zaha sent a first-time shot off target from another Olise delivery, but Southampton grew in confidence the longer they kept Palace at bay.Armstrong's looping header from Ainsley Maitland-Niles' cross appeared to be drifting towards the far corner until Guaita got a strong hand to the ball, but moments later he made the mistake that led to Armstrong's winner.Palace - semi-finalists last season - rarely looked like fashioning an equaliser despite a late push as Southampton held on for a win that could give their faltering campaign a much-needed boost.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64167832

Leicester were FA Cup winners in the 2020-21 seasonLeicester arrived at League Two Gillingham after a disappointing run of three consecutive defeats in the Premier League.In blustery conditions, Jamie Vardy was the first to test Gills goalkeeper Jake Turner inside five minutes, but the 23-year-old blocked the striker's attempt to the delight of the home fans.Watch video highlights of Saturday's FA Cup tiesLess than a minute later, a positive counter-attack by Gillingham resulted in midfielder Dom Jefferies trying a low effort that was saved by Leicester keeper Daniel Iversen. Neil Harris' Gillingham have only scored seven league goals this season, but captain Shaun Williams also came close to causing Leicester problems with two chances in the opening 45 minutes. But the hosts' resistance was broken after the break in a scrappy manner as McAteer's ball into the middle bobbled across the pitch and landed at the feet of Iheanacho who lashed a shot into the top corner.Relief for Leicester fans after Premier League woesThe conditions were far from ideal for the travelling supporters in Kent, but at least the journey home will be happier this time around for the Leicester faithful with a place in the FA Cup fourth round secured. Brendan Rodgers made eight changes to the side beaten by Fulham in midweek and was hoping an FA Cup giant-killing would not be added to their miserable run of form.The 2020-21 winners had to work hard throughout the 90 minutes and really should have doubled their lead late on when Iheanacho sent a searching low cross to the back post which substitute Patson Daka failed to connect with.For Gillingham, a tie against a top-flight team did not end in embarrassment and for large parts of the game they matched the Foxes' intensity and tenacity, with the club's new owner Brad Galinson saying they played with ""heart and soul"" in a half-time interview. Galinson and Gills boss Harris will now be focused on trying to keep the club in the Football League and using this performance as the catalyst.

What we needed to do was have a calmness in our play, keep creating opportunities and hopefully scoring.""The second half was very good and we were well worthy.""To concede a scruffy goal on our behalf was disappointing, but probably sometimes that's what we've needed - to go 'we can't just roll over, we've got to compete and have a go' and we did that.""Huddersfield manager Mark Fotheringham told BBC Radio Leeds:""It was a great exercise, we got a lot of answers and we had a lot of young players on the team.""The goals we lost were absolutely unacceptable and that's happened now in the last two games. I'm very unsatisfied with that and I've made that clear to the lads, they're obviously disappointed.""When Florian scored we were very much on top and I feel the game swung on his second chance.

The centre-half, who had stayed forward following a free-kick, stabbed the ball past Wayne Hennessey from 10 yards.Forest were on top either side of half-time, with Ekpiteta making a couple of important blocks in the second half.But Neco Williams gave the ball away in his own half to Blackpool substitute Yates, whose run into the box resulted in on-loan Leeds winger Poveda bundling the ball in.Hamilton exchanged passes with another sub, Kenny Dougall, before hitting a fine volley inside the far post from the left side of the box, and Yates wrapped up a fine win with a half-volley via the crossbar from Poveda's cross.""Everyone played their part,"" Appleton added.

It was very open. When we conceded the goal they started to be better than us - especially in the first half. ""I'm pleased to have a second opportunity to get through because, for many moments in the game, they were better than us. They played with a lot of harmony.""We were losing many individual challenges and losing many second balls in the middle of the pitch, which allowed them to control the game.""At least we have the opportunity to go through in the cup at home. When you cannot win it is important to have the opportunity to go again.""Chesterfield assistant manager Danny Ward told BBC Radio Sheffield:""It's a bit of a sickener - you take it to the last minute and they hit an equaliser, you probably wouldn't have believed it. Disappointed to conceded so late but we've scored three goals against a Championship side and I think we can be very proud.""Fair play to West Brom, I think you saw the reaction from their supporters what it means to them to get that replay. He (Carlos Corberan) was bringing on a lot of big hitters towards the end - he wasn't happy losing the game to a National League team so fair play for giving us that respect.""At 3-2 at half-time it was one of the best games I've seen for a long time - for a neutral it was a great way to finish the game but we'll take thousands down there and try to do it all again.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64167895

But I thought as the first half went on we got better and we got the goal at a very good time.""In the second half we were excellent, there was a lot more intensity and we got into a lot of good areas. It was the last bit that was lacking, creating that big, big chance and that's down to us to work on.""The lads gave absolutely everything and it wasn't to be - but if we don't win, don't lose. Overall we'll take the replay and we have to try and do it up there now.""It was a phenomenal save from Ethan and we needed him to make that big save.

889,Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 Newcastle United: Josh Windass double gives League One side win,SAT 07 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"Highlights: Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 Newcastle UnitedLeague One side Sheffield Wednesday pulled off a memorable FA Cup shock as they knocked out the Premier League's third-placed side Newcastle United.Josh Windass scored twice in the second half for the Owls as they came out on top in a pulsating tie at Hillsborough.Substitute Bruno Guimaraes gave Newcastle hope with more than 20 minutes left with a close-range finish but they could not force an equaliser.It is the first defeat for Eddie Howe's side since 31 August against Liverpool.After both sides spurned good opportunities in a lively first half, Windass opened the scoring seven minutes into the second period when he finished off a flowing move.George Byers started it with a clever turn just inside the Newcastle half before driving towards the penalty area.He fed the ball wide to Liam Palmer, who slipped in Dennis Adeniran and his cross-shot was turned in by Windass. The forward looked as if he may have been slightly offside but the assistant did not flag and with no VAR in operation, the goal stood.There was nothing controversial about the second. Windass was sent clear by Michael Smith's fine first-time pass and showed terrific composure as he opened up his body and curled the ball past Martin Dubravka into the corner of the net.Hillsborough was bouncing but the home side's lead was halved just four minutes later when Brazil midfielder Guimaraes, who also looked to be close to offside, stabbed in from a yard out after the Owls failed to deal with a corner.""It's one of the proudest moments in my managerial career,"" Owls manager Darren Moore told the BBC.""I'm really pleased for everybody at the club and I'm delighted for the players. We were up against a really good team and put in an excellent performance.""We knew we had to perform on and off the ball, and the way we went about it was spot on. We believe we can score goals, we got them, and then were resolute to the onslaught at the end.""Windass almost completed his hat-trick with a ferocious long-range free-kick that came back off the bar and although home goalkeeper Cameron Dawson made a number of vital saves, he could only watch as Chris Wood blazed Newcastle's best chance of an equaliser over with eight minutes to go.""We didn't allow them to settle into their rhythm and that gave us some hope in the game,"" added Moore. ""I thought every one of them did well. Josh will get the headlines but Cameron pulled off a couple of great saves.""You know you're going to get tested against teams like this so your keeper has to concentrate and be in the right place when needed, and he was.""Owls make Magpies pay for missed chancesFor a League One side to beat an in-form Premier League team - even one showing numerous changes from their usual league line-up - an element of fortune is always likely to be required.While impressive Wednesday had plenty of the play for long periods, Newcastle will lament the opportunities they spurned.""We created enough chances to win the tie and their goalkeeper made a number of great saves but we weren't clinical enough when those presentable opportunities were there,"" Howe told BBC Sport.""We have to accept the defeat and Sheffield Wednesday battled for everything, as we did, but it wasn't to be.""Howe added: ""We haven't experienced defeat a lot this season and it's very painful, you don't want to lose any game.""Newcastle welcomed back record signing Alexander Isak after a hamstring injury that has kept him out since September and, while there were glimpses of the quality he possesses, there were also signs of rust.The Sweden striker had a glorious chance to put the away side ahead and while his header from six yards out was superbly saved by Dawson, the goalkeeper ought to have been given no chance.Josh Windass scored his 10th and 11th goals of the season for Sheffield WednesdayRelive Sheff Wed v Newcastle and all of the FA Cup third-round actionLater in the half, he shot straight at the keeper when afforded space in the area, while Jacob Murphy should have done better when sent clear by a ball over the top.Wood missed the best chance of the lot late on, getting his finish all wrong after being teed up by Joelinton.Crucially, though, the Owls had the quality and determination to make the most of Newcastle's profligacy and defended their lead valiantly to secure a famous win.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64167995

Wolves led after Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson horrifically gave the ball away and Goncalo Guedes tapped home.Darwin Nunez's classy left-footed volley pulled Liverpool level, before Mohamed Salah side-footed them ahead.Hwang Hee-chan then came off the bench to earn Wolves a replay, with the ball ricocheting in off his side.Wolves thought they had won the game when Toti flicked home, but the linesman had ruled it offside earlier in the move.Nunez levels for Liverpool with 'super finish'A replay is likely to anger Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who reiterated his opposition to them as recently as Friday.Follow reaction to Liverpool v WolvesWatch all the goals from the FA Cup third roundHow to follow the FA Cup third round on the BBCBoth sides thrill in fair drawLiverpool started the game sharply, but Klopp will be concerned that his side found themselves behind for the third successive game.Rather than a tactical issue like in previous games, this was purely a personal error.Guedes fires Wolves into the lead after Alisson mishapAlisson rolled the ball out to Thiago, who tried to dribble past his man 25 yards from his own goal, but was intercepted. The ball ended up back at Alisson, who tried to pass it out to Trent Alexander-Arnold, but Guedes intercepted and slotted in.Wolves were buoyed and pressed for a second, with Guedes having a shot tipped away, before Raul Jimenez was inches away from tapping home a dragged Adama Traore shot. The leveller, and timing of it, will annoy Wolves. A rash clearance from Nathan Collins found Alexander-Arnold, and his clipped pass found Nunez, who side-footed into the far corner on the stroke of half-time.Salah's goal was clinical. He latched onto a poor headed clearance from Toti, and slotted into the corner. Liverpool's defensive issues reared their head again when Rayan Ait-Nouri broke in behind the defence, but his effort was saved by the outstretched leg of Alisson.Wolves got their deserved equaliser when Matheus Cunha's slide cross hit Ibrahima Konate and then Hwang's side before going in.There was confusion around Toti's disallowed goal, with Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui outraged by the decision. The linesman flagged for offside against the initial corner taker, after he received the clearance. The VAR then had no camera angle available with any evidence to overturn the decision. Despite that, Lopetegui will be happy with the performance, with Wolves worthy of a draw and causing Liverpool numerous problems throughout the game.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64168002
891,Manchester United 3-1 Everton: Marcus Rashford shines as Man Utd beat Everton in FA Cup,FRI 06 Jan 2023,fa-cup,"FA Cup highlights: Man Utd 3-1 EvertonMarcus Rashford scored for a fifth successive game as Manchester United increased the pressure on Everton boss Frank Lampard with a deserved FA Cup victory at Old Trafford.Everton were applauded off by their travelling support for showing admirable character, after their side suffered the shock of going behind after just three minutes when Antony turned home Rashford's far-post cross but had the character to fight back.Conor Coady rammed home a 13th-minute equaliser when David de Gea calamitously allowed Neal Maupay's apparently harmless cross to roll though his legs as he appeared to think it was about to hit the outside of his post.Even after Alex Iwobi was stretchered off in obvious pain after he suffered an ankle injury in a tackle with Tyrell Malacia, Lampard's players continued to battle hard.But once some brilliant approach play from Rashford had deceived Coady into turning the forward's cross into his own net, the visitors' character alone was not enough.And after Dominic Calvert-Lewin had a goal ruled out for offside, man-of-the-match Rashford kept his nerve to beat England international team-mate Jordan Pickford from the spot deep into injury time to score for the fifth successive game for the first time in his club career.Coady says Everton in 'a bad place' but fighting for LampardTen Hag backs Rashford to continue goalscoring runMan Utd v Everton as it happened, plus reaction and analysisTen Hag to persevere with patient Sancho approach  Rashford good, De Gea not so good There was an irony in De Gea making such a huge blunder on the same day as United confirmed one-time England keeper Jack Butland had joined them on loan.In the build-up to the game, Ten Hag had taken the unusual step of talking about Butland before his loan from Crystal Palace until the end of the season had been completed. In doing so, the United boss said more than once it was clear De Gea was his first choice.The goal was bad enough but De Gea, whose form this season has generally been excellent, almost gifted Everton a second equaliser deep into the second half when he dithered over a clearance outside his area and was fortunate Calvert-Lewin didn't seize the opportunity.The former Spain keeper is still in negotiations over an extension to his contract, which expires in the summer. Mistakes like those in this game will strengthen United's position in believing he is not worth his current £375,000-a-week, although the belief is that a compromise position will eventually be reached.In contrast, Rashford is in just the right form to think United's hierarchy will want him to stay far longer than the end of next season, which his present deal has been extended until.In addition to his goal and two assists, Rashford brought a superb fingertip save out of Pickford and provided by far the most potent attacking threat in a team that didn't always hit the heights.However, with 10 wins out of 11 in all competitions, United are in good heart before a week that includes an EFL Cup quarter-final with League One Charlton before they entertain Manchester City on 14 January.Rashford has scored in each of the five games for Manchester United since the end of the World CupEverton fans make their feelings knownGiven the mutinous atmosphere at the final whistle at Goodison Park on Tuesday as Everton collapsed to a 4-1 home defeat by Brighton, and the simmering discontent that led to three chants of 'Sack the Board' from the 9,500-strong visiting contingent in the 15 minutes before kick-off, conceding a goal so early must have been extremely worrying for Lampard.For a short time afterwards, it appeared Everton would be swept away as their hosts looked to build on their early success.It is to the credit of Lampard's players that they clung on and had started to play themselves into the contest before De Gea's error gifted them an equaliser.Coady's personality is so positive and his influence so great, Gareth Southgate has taken the defender to two tournaments, even though he has not given him a game. The man many at Wolves wish was still their captain epitomises the fighting spirt Everton are desperate for in their current plight.Conor Coady scored his second Everton goal since his loan move from Wolves in AugustIt was unfortunate he was responsible for United's second but, typically, he refused to let the setback affect him.The players' collective contribution was recognised by the Everton fans after the final whistle but once more there were chants for those running the club to leave, rather than Lampard, who remains under pressure after two draws and six defeats in the past eight games.Man Utd apologyAs they celebrated their side's second goal, a section of the Manchester United fans chanted 'Sacked in the morning' at Lampard and followed up with a familiar homophobic chant about Chelsea, the club he had a stellar playing career with.In October, after a similar song was sung by United fans at Stamford Bridge, the club released a statement condemning the abuse, and after this latest incident they reiterated their position.""Homophobia, like all forms of discrimination, has no place in football. Manchester United are proud of our diverse fan base and the work we have done to reduce instances like we sadly heard today,"" the club said.""We will continue to campaign for inclusivity and to tackle discriminatory abuse whether inside stadiums or online. This includes working with fan groups to educate fans on the offence which discriminatory language causes.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64182366

Only Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead have done so more often in English top-flight games than the 22-year-old England international.City looked every inch a side which have not lost in 90 minutes since 25 September, and must now be considered a serious contender for the WSL title.They could even afford for WSL top scorer Khadija Shaw - watched from the stands by fellow Jamaican star Usain Bolt - to have a rare off day.Bright absence leaves Chelsea in the darkAs good as City were, Chelsea were far below their best, and manager Emma Hayes did not even wait until half-time before making her first changes.Lauren James and Sophie Ingle were hooked before the interval, and Chelsea were sent out several minutes early from their break.In defence Chelsea were unusually shaky, clearly missing Millie Bright who was absent after picking up an injury during their midweek Champions League quarter-final first-leg win over defending champions Lyon.Hayes said Bright should be back in time to face the French side for next week's second leg. She cannot get the England central defender back again soon enough.Going forward, Chelsea were limited to playing long balls over the top for Sam Kerr to chase, which City comfortably dealt with after cutting off the supply from midfield.Kerr, currently on 49 WSL goals, had few chances, firing straight at Ellie Roebuck early on before being denied from a tight angle by the City keeper in the second half.Chelsea improved after the break, however their best chance of the whole game came in injury time, Melanie Leupolz volleying over from 12 yards.Hayes was also given another worry when Erin Cuthbert limped off with an injury in the second half, leaving the Scottish midfielder a doubt for the second leg against Lyon.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65004828
895,Aston Villa Women 5-0 Leicester City Women: Rachel Daly double helps Villa thrash Foxes,SUN 26 Mar 2023,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights: Aston Villa 5-0 Leicester CityEngland forward Rachel Daly and Alisha Lehmann both struck twice as clinical Aston Villa put the Women's Super League's bottom side Leicester to the sword at Villa Park. In front of a lively crowd of 6,489 - just shy of Villa's record attendance for a women's game - Daly took her tally for the season to 13 WSL goals, just two behind the league's top scorer, Manchester City's Khadija Shaw. Kenza Dali found the bottom corner from 20 yards to put Villa ahead and Lehmann produced a controlled first-time finish from Kirsty Hanson's low cross to double the lead. Daly then continued her bid for the WSL's Golden Boot as she robbed Sophie Howard to roll home Villa's third and, after the interval, steered Lehmann's inviting low centre beyond Janina Leitzig. She then turned provider for Villa's fifth with a clever reverse pass that freed Maz Pacheco to cross for Lehmann to bundle home her second as the fifth-placed hosts registered a fourth straight WSL win. The margin of defeat was harsh on Leicester but the WSL's lowest scorers were made to pay for a wasteful first half in which they spurned several chances, with the loss leaving them two points from safety. Relive Sunday's Women's Super League matchesVilla's superb season shows no signs of slowing While Villa fell just a few hundred short of a record crowd on the terraces on Women's Football Weekend, they certainly did not fall short on the pitch.Victory virtually assured a top-half finish in what is proving to be the most successful season in the club's history - never before have they recorded four consecutive top-flight wins. Indeed, this was a sixth straight victory in all competitions, albeit a couple have come via extra time or penalties, with Villa also having an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea to look forward to. Daly - already Villa's highest scorer in a single season - will have other honours on her mind, with six games remaining to overhaul the WSL's leading scorer Shaw. In this form, her chances should not be discounted. She also provided a third assist of the season, for Dali's opener, and nearly added a fourth late on, crossing for teenager Georgia Mullett who almost capped a perfect day for the hosts, only for Leitzig to tip aside her header. Dali and Lehmann were rewarded with standing ovations by the boisterous home support as they came off late on and, by the end, there were almost as many goals as claret and blue foam fingers in the crowd. Feeble finishing costs Foxes Leicester manager Willie Kirk took over the struggling Foxes in November, replacing Lydia BedfordYou never have any luck when you are down the bottom, so the cliche goes, and Leicester had plenty of reason to believe it after five minutes at Villa Park. Josie Green stood up a fine cross to the far post and, although Sam Tierney's volley was well struck, Villa's England keeper Hannah Hampton produced a superb reactive save to keep it out. Then, as a scramble ensued, Tierney came back from an offside position to touch the ball before Aileen Whelan lashed it into the roof of the net. A minute later, Villa were ahead and even then Leicester could have levelled as a loose ball dropped to Hannah Cain, whose vicious strike looked destined for the net until it struck Dali flush in the back. When Ashleigh Plumptre fired straight at Hampton from 15 yards with Leicester 2-0 down, the visitors would have feared the worst and so it proved as they failed to score for the 11th time in 16 WSL matches this season. The Foxes staged a near-miraculous escape from relegation last season but, after netting just seven times in 16 matches, their fate will likely depend on huge home games against eighth-placed Liverpool and relegation rivals Reading in April.

Guro Bergsvand flicked a header goalwards and Sarri was alert to poke home.Reading had a great chance to pull a goal back when Faye Bryson's superb volley was tipped over the bar by keeper Lydia Williams.But Harries proved the difference for the hosts with two goals in 14 minutes.Captain Emma Mukandi provided the assist with a hopeful ball forward and Harries took it under control and glided through the defence to score.Lily Woodham then floated in a cross that was met by a cushioned header from Harries for the equaliser.A battling comeback will give Reading a much-needed boost after losing to Chelsea in the FA Cup last weekend.Their next fixture is a must-win game against bottom club Leicester.After this display, Harries should now be in contention to start a match that Reading cannot afford to lose if they are to keep their place in the WSL.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65004830

Little then rifled into the roof of the net to restore their two-goal advantage.Foord and Maanum then added two more as Arsenal sealed an emphatic victory.Arsenal lay down a markerArsenal have games against the rest of the top four in their remaining fixturesJonas Eidevall's side may be behind in the title race but they remain firmly in the mix for the top spot.With matches against the rest of the top four still to play, lifting the trophy is still within their sights.They bounced back in fine fashion from Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat by Bayern Munich and appeared improved by the introduction of Victoria Pelova to the starting line-up.The January signing was creative on the wing and assisted both of Foord's goals.Foord's tenacity continually posed problems for the hosts and she could be a dangerous prospect when they take on fellow challengers Manchester City next weekend.Arsenal host Bayern in the second leg of their quarter-final before that - and Eidevall believes his side's performance on Saturday was good preparation.He said: ""Hopefully we go into the game on Wednesday with a good bit of self-confidence and I think we should have that from our performances.""It is not a team who have one or two strong performances. We have built good momentum coming into these two games against Bayern Munich and City. Now it is up to us to execute it.""City, who are fourth, face second-place Chelsea on Sunday.Spurs' improvement haltedTottenham are only five points clear of the relegation spot and have played a game more than bottom club LeicesterTottenham halted their nine-game WSL losing streak with victory over Leicester City on 15 March in interim boss Vicky Jepson's first game in charge.She took the reins after Rehanne Skinner was dismissed, and this result ensures they remain among the league's relegation-threatened sides in ninth - five points ahead of bottom club Leicester and having played a game more.Spurs were strong for much of the first half against Arsenal but rapidly succumbed as the Gunners' relentless attacking became too much to handle after the break.Fellow strugglers Reading and Brighton are among their six remaining opponents, and Jepson will need to turn things around if Spurs are to stop looking over their shoulders.""When they go 3-1 up, it was probably the nail in the coffin,"" said Jepson.""Then they built momentum and we had to ride the storm. We didn't ride the storm as well as we would like to and we find ourselves 5-1 down.""It is just one of those things. The first half we showed character, we showed grit and we created opportunities to get us back in the game, but second half, as a collective, we are all disappointed.""We feel sorry for the fans because the final whistle goes in a north London derby and it should never be that scoreline.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64997984

Cissoko slid in clumsily on Alessia Russo, catching the England forward as she checked back.United captain Zelem was the calmest woman in Old Trafford as she tucked the penalty away, to cheers as much of relief as of joy from the home supporters.They were further calmed 15 minutes later when second half sub Garcia broke the Hammers offside trap, controlled Toone's lofted through ball and slotted past West Ham keeper Mackenzie Arnold.United were finally calm enough to put together a flowing move for their third goal in the final 10 minutes, Ladd curling into the bottom corner from Ona Batlle's fine cut back, before Garcia got her second by tapping in the rebound after Arnold parried a shot from Martha Thomas.Galton's century marked in styleWhile there may have been annoyance at some of the refereeing decisions from United, they could only blame themselves for a lack of creativity in the opening 45 minutes which left chances at a premium.One thing United did not lack was effort up front however, primarily driven by Galton, making her 100th appearance for the club and presented with a commemorative framed shirt before the game.Galton, the fourth player to reach a United women's century after joining the club following their formation in 2018, was the one to close down Risa Shimizu to win the ball for Toone to play in Garcia for the second goal. United are often irresistible at home, scoring 53 goals in their last 15 home WSL matches with four or more strikes in nine of those fixtures, including tonight.Here they had to be a lot more patient against Paul Konchesky's side, who were hoping for a repeat of their display against Arsenal earlier this year, where they held another WSL title hopeful to a 0-0 draw.However, West Ham offered very little at the other end of the pitch, and remain winless in the WSL in 2023. Only their solid form in the first half of the season - five wins in their first 10 games - should stave off a relegation fight.

899,Everton 1-1 Liverpool: Toffees held to WSL draw in feisty Merseyside derby,FRI 24 Mar 2023,womens-super-league,"Everton v Liverpool WSL highlightsEverton were held to a draw by Liverpool in a feisty Women's Super League Merseyside derby at a raucous Goodison Park.Watched by a club record crowd of 22,161 fans, the match was the first women's derby to be played at the men's stadium.Everton captain Gabby George opened the scoring in the 27th minute, floating in what looked like a cross from close to the byeline, but curling it out of reach of keeper Rachael Laws.Liverpool levelled when Taylor Hinds' low shot ricocheted off Katie Stengel, but the forward managed to get the ball under control, turn and shoot low to the left and just out of reach of goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan.A thrilling second half saw a goal apiece chalked off as Leighanne Robe's effort for the Reds was denied by what looked like an innocuous challenge by Ceri Holland on Brosnan.Jess Park then curled a stunning shot into the top corner for Everton, but it was ruled out for a handball in the build-up.But despite some superb efforts from both sides, neither could find the winner to give their expectant fans bragging rights.Liverpool manager Matt Beard told Sky Sports his side ""should have won the game"", adding: ""I've just seen the disallowed goal and can't believe it, it's crazy.""I thought we created numerous chances, we just lacked composure in the final third. We frustrated Everton, but they put their bodies on the line. Courtney Brosnan was their best player by a country mile.""Sixth-placed Everton are now without a win in four games, while a point for Liverpool puts them eight points clear of the relegation place.Everton denied double successWhile there was a clear section of away fans in the corner of the Bullens Road Stand at Goodison Park, an eruption of noise indicated a significant number of Liverpool fans scattered around the rest of the ground when Stengel got her equaliser.Both sets of supporters mingled in the fan zone prior to the game and the atmosphere inside felt almost like a 50-50 split rather than an Everton home game.The Toffees had spoiled Liverpool's party when they beat them 3-0 at Anfield in September in what was supposed to be a celebration of their return to the WSL after a two-year absence.But Everton were unable to complete a double, despite good efforts from George and Nicoline Sorensen.Just over 5,000 last witnessed Everton women play at Goodison Park and when the Toffees attacked the Gwladys Street end in the second period, the volume increased notably.Even though there were no goals after the break, both had opportunities to take the win and neither disallowed goal was without controversy.Everton had a glorious chance to re-establish their lead when Sorensen whipped in a pinpoint accurate cross and Jess Park only had to get her header on target, but it flew wide. She buried her face in the turf knowing she should have scored.Toffees defender Megan Finnigan came to her side's rescue in a thrilling climax when Shanice van de Sanden lost her marker to set up Stengel in the penalty area.But the American's effort was blocked on the line, before Brosnan also made a fine save in the closing stages to deny Stengel again.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64985341

Willie Kirk's side missed the chance to leapfrog their opponents and stay one point behind Brighton in 11th.Relive the action from Tottenham v Leicester in the WSLWinning start for Jepson eases Spurs relegation fearsWhile Leicester were unable to create a real chance of note in the closing stages, there was understandable tension emitting from the Tottenham players and staff as they tried to cling on for a first league win since beating Brighton 8-0 on 30 October.Few could have foreseen the run that followed as Spurs plummeted from fifth to 10th and found themselves firmly in a relegation battle. Even the additions of England and Mana Iwabuchi, on loan from Arsenal, could not stop the rot.It came as little shock then when the decision was made to part ways with Skinner. The only slight surprise was that they did so just two days before such a crucial meeting with a much-improved Leicester side.Assistant manager Jepson, the former Liverpool boss, was installed as a temporary replacement. Her team's display was largely unimpressive, but they got the result they needed.Leicester were the better side in a dire first half but their own lack of cutting edge ensured Spurs' sloppiness in possession went unpunished.However, England was brought in from Chelsea to make the difference for Spurs - albeit they hoped it would be as they challenged higher up the table - and did so against Leicester to give her side a five-point cushion in the fight against the drop.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64279743

However, there was no let off the third time.Lauren James played a pinpoint ball over the top from the right touchline, Kerr timed her run to perfection, brought the ball down on her chest, then lifted it gloriously over Earps and into the far corner.Follow live updates of Sunday's WSL actionMarc Skinner's side had an opportunity to equalise almost immediately when a Chelsea slip allowed Ella Toone space in the box. But the England attacking midfielder seemed torn between going for goal and crossing, and the result was neither one nor the other as the ball sailed wide.United felt they should have had a penalty in the 33rd minute when Nikita Parris went down under contact from Kadeisha Buchanan, but referee Cheryl Foster waved played on.Kerr remained Chelsea's main threat in the second half, muscling Maya le Tissier off the ball before side-footing just wide. And while United pushed for a leveller in the closing stages, they failed to create any clear chances and the hosts held on.""We deserved it - that was a Chelsea performance,"" Hayes said.""Depleted - we have a sickness bug in the camp - we couldn't play Erin Cuthbert carrying a knock and Jelena Cankovic is carrying a knock too. ""What a tremendous squad I have and I've been saying it every week that it was time for other players to step up.""It's just a massive three points and when we came into the game, we had played two games more than Manchester United since they last kicked-off.""They played Leicester earlier last weekend, so to win like that and against a team who are top of the league is amazing for my team - fantastic effort.""Chelsea are now two points clear at the top as they bid for a sixth WSL title.Kerr quality helps Chelsea overcome injury problems'One of the goals of the season' - Kerr hits superb openerThe depth of talent available to Chelsea is no secret but with Fran Kirby, Guro Reiten, Pernille Harder, Katerina Svitkova and Erin Cuthbert all unavailable, they needed every last bit of it against United.Even in a team of stars, Kerr has often shone brightest and - like so many great players - has a knack of delivering when it matters most.In a game of few chances, Kerr was a threat throughout with her very presence seeming to unnerve a United backline that had been breached just eight times in the WSL this campaign.""Listen, she should have had a hat-trick,"" Hayes added. ""To be fair, I'll say that because that's how good she is. ""We set up really well to get her into good goalscoring positions - and let's talk about the work she does for the team defensively because everybody had to put a shift in.""An early ball over the top was not fully dealt with by the away team and Kerr was able to steal in and bring a save from Earps.After 12 minutes, Melanie Leupolz slid the ball through to Kerr and after holding off Le Tissier, saw her left-footed shot saved by the legs of Earps.There was nothing the England keeper could do when Kerr next went through, though. The pass from James was exquisite, the first touch from the striker was excellent but the angle wasn't easy and Le Tissier was on her shoulder.Kerr made the lobbed finish look simple. A moment of genius that deserved to win such a mammoth top-of-the-table clash.A week after losing the League Cup final, Chelsea have taken a big stride towards a fifth WSL crown in six years.United lack cutting edge as title bid faltersAfter finishing fourth last season, that United are even in a title race shows the progress they have made.At the home of the defending champions, they controlled possession for long spells of the game and, for all that Kerr tormented the defence, they still managed to limit Chelsea's opportunities.But at no stage did they really look like unlocking a stubborn home defence.""We knew we are going to be without the ball for large periods and everyone was disciplined in their roles which they carried out the gameplan to perfection, "" Chelsea boss Hayes said.Toone had the chance to create something just after the goal but she and Alessia Russo were largely kept quiet by Chelsea.The non-penalty award after Parris appeared to be tripped by Buchanan will rankle but given the lofty ambitions for this side, Skinner will also be frustrated by the failure to trouble an under-strength Chelsea more.Millie Turner's back-post header and a sliced effort from Leah Galton were as close as they came with Chelsea able to keep them at arm's length.The title race still has a way to go but with Chelsea in a position to stretch their lead to five points by winning their game in hand, there is no more margin for error and United cannot afford another off day from an attack that has been so prolific for much of the season.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64852038

908,Chelsea Women 3-1 Brighton & Hove Albion Women: Blues move up to second in WSL,WED 08 Mar 2023,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights: Dominant Chelsea beat Brighton 3-1Chelsea put their League Cup final defeat behind them to beat Brighton and move one point behind Women's Super League leaders Manchester United.Blues boss Emma Hayes got the response she demanded as Chelsea moved up to second in the table before Sunday's home game against United.Managerless Brighton fell behind to Guro Reiten's penalty before Jess Carter doubled the hosts' lead.Johanna Rytting Kaneryd added a third before Danielle Carter's consolation. The Blues dominated despite making seven changes to the side who were beaten by Arsenal at Selhurst Park on Sunday.Sweden winger Kaneryd had an early attempt cleared off the line when the game was goalless, Jelena Cankovic clipped the bar and Sam Kerr had an attempt ruled out for offside.Brighton, who announced manager Jens Scheuer's departure on Monday by mutual consent after only two months in charge, hit the bar after half-time through Elisabeth Terland.They remain 11th in the table on eight points, two more than bottom club Leicester City.Reaction as Chelsea beat Brighton, plus how Wednesday's WSL action unfolded Scheuer leaves Brighton after two months in charge Chelsea show character to bounce backChelsea were hurting after missing out on a first major trophy of the season, with Hayes admitting her stars did not match Arsenal's desire at the weekend.But they remain very much in the hunt for a fourth successive WSL title with Sunday's game against Manchester United - which is live on BBC Two at 12:30 GMT - a fixture of huge significance at the top.Chelsea, who have a game in hand on the leaders, have won 11 times in an unbeaten 12-match league run.This result - and response - was just what Hayes wanted before a crucial three weeks which also includes a Champions League quarter-final against holders Lyon and an FA Cup quarter-final at Reading.The only surprise was that Kerr - one of four survivors from the starting XI against Arsenal - failed to find the net after scoring 11 times in her previous six games.Kerr looked set to make it 3-0 but was denied by an excellent save by Australia team-mate Lydia Williams from eight yards, before setting up Kaneryd to wrap up a comfortable win.Chelsea have scored 73 goals in 24 games in all competitions this seasonPositives in defeat for BrightonThere were positives in defeat for Amy Merricks, who is in her second spell as Brighton's interim boss this season.At 2-0 down, the Seagulls enjoyed their best spell of the match and Terland struck the bar with an ambitious attempt from an angle.Even after falling 3-0 behind, the visitors showed fight as substitute Carter scored four minutes after coming on to deny Chelsea a clean sheet.It remains to be seen how long Merricks stays in charge on this occasion, after taking four points from three WSL games following Hope Powell's departure before Scheuer was appointed.But Brighton need to tighten up defensively as they battle to avoid relegation. They have conceded 54 goals in 16 games since registering their last shutout in the WSL in March 2022.'Goal difference is going to matter' - reactionChelsea manager Emma Hayes: ""It was a great response. The team wanted to focus on its defending and it was something Millie [Bright] spoke about before the game. ""This is an amazing group of women. They know what it takes and what it needs [to react after the Arsenal defeat] and I thought they responded in the way that we would all want them to.""The players are upset about conceding a sloppy goal so late and goal difference is going to matter. ""I've taken Millie off and given other players an opportunity. If you disrupt the backline you have to expect that. But for me the priority was winning the game and we still have to play a third game this week. It's an important game and we need to have players fresh for Sunday."" Brighton interim boss Amy Merricks: ""I'm really proud of the players for the way they applied themselves. We can build on that second-half performance. I was really impressed with the way the competed because it has been a whirlwind 48 hours.""Our full attention turns to Manchester City on Sunday. It's a huge game and opportunity for us.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64806845
909,Manchester United 5-1 Leicester City: Alessia Russo scores hat-trick in United rout,SUN 05 Mar 2023,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights: Alessia Russo stars as Man Utd put five past LeicesterAlessia Russo scored a hat-trick as Manchester United extended their lead at the top of the Women's Super League by overpowering Leicester City.The England striker netted twice in the first half, before Foxes debutant Remy Siemsen reduced the deficit.However, Russo immediately tapped home her third and set up Leah Galton for a fourth, with Lucia Garcia also netting.Victory moves United four points above Chelsea before they face the defending champions on Sunday, 12 March.The Red Devils dominated throughout against bottom side Leicester and could have been two up in the first 10 minutes, if not for brilliant saves from Janina Leitzig.The on-loan Bayern Munich goalkeeper thwarted the hosts again in the lead-up to the opening goal but Russo's persistence paid off as she slid in to fire a rebound home.England striker Russo doubled United's lead on 37 minutes with a simple header from Ona Batlle's cross after Ella Toone's pass had sliced open the Foxes' backline.Leicester started the second half brightly and were rewarded when Siemsen fired home from the edge of the box.But United responded by moving through the gears, Leitzig superbly denying Russo's rasping volley only for the 24-year-old to tap home from the resulting corner.With the game won, Russo turned provider with a clever flick for Galton who netted her fourth goal in her past five games.After hitting the post, Russo was withdrawn to rapturous applause and substitute Garcia added a fifth for United late on, rolling home her third goal of the season.After losing their first eight matches, Leicester had appeared doomed but under new boss Willie Kirk they had won two of their past three to climb to within a point of safety.Their performance was in a different league to Manchester United here, but fixtures against fellow strugglers Spurs and Reading in the upcoming weeks will be crucial in the battle to avoid the drop.Clinical Russo powers United's title chargeAlessia Russo has now scored eight times in the Women's Super League this seasonUnited boss Marc Skinner said before the game his side ""could beat any team in the country"" and his players needed little encouragement to tear into the Foxes from the first whistle.Despite being the WSL's second-highest scorers, they had only managed three in their past four matches - but addressed that in a performance full of attacking intent. Russo had not netted in the league for United since the 6-0 win over Liverpool on 15 January but a game against the league's worst defence offered a prime opportunity to add to her tally. Her movement and ruthless finishing demonstrated why title rivals Arsenal offered two world-record fees for her services in January and her form will be pivotal if United are to wrestle the title from Chelsea, who have won the WSL three times in a row.The 3-1 defeat by Chelsea in the reverse fixture in November remains United's only loss of the season and the stage is set for a potential title showdown at Kingsmeadow next weekend.It will also likely offer a more stringent examination of Mary Earps, who was named women's goalkeeper of the year at the Fifa Best Awards earlier this week but rarely tested in this game.If Chelsea win their first of two matches in hand against Brighton on Wednesday, they will cut the gap at the top to one point before hosting United.Skinner's assertion about his side's prowess is about to face the ultimate test.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64775009
910,Everton 0-2 Aston Villa: Visitors secure impressive win,SUN 05 Mar 2023,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights : Aston Villa beat Everton to extend unbeaten runAston Villa extended their unbeaten run in the Women's Super League to five games with victory over Everton at Walton Hall Park. A strike from Kenza Dali and an own goal from unfortunate Everton defender Megan Finnigan helped Villa close the gap on fourth-placed Arsenal.In a tight game, Everton went close through Rikke Sedecke and Jess Park, but could not find a way through. They remain in sixth with a game in hand on Villa.Villa took an early lead when WSL top-scorer Rachel Daly turned provider. Her clever pass teed up Dali, whose shot took a slight deflection and kissed the post on its way past Courtney Brosnan. Carla Ward's side mostly held Everton at arm's length and consolidated their lead when Mayumi Pacheco's low cross was inadvertently turned in by Finnigan. With the Toffees having only scored 16 goals this season, Villa saw out the game with relative ease and Daly was inches from a third when heading over in the dying seconds.Meet the Holmgaards - Everton's identical twins",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64775017
911,Man City 3-1 Tottenham: Khadija Shaw hat-trick seals comeback win,SUN 05 Mar 2023,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights: Khadija Shaw scores hat-trick as Man City move up to secondKhadija Shaw boosted Manchester City's Women's Super League title bid with a hat-trick as they came from behind to beat struggling Tottenham Hotspur.Celin Bizet's opener stunned the Blues as Spurs threatened to repeat last season's shock win at Academy Stadium.Shaw equalised with a header before half-time, made it 2-1 with a penalty and struck late to seal victory that lifted City up to second place. The win is boss Gareth Taylor's 73rd in 100 games in charge of the club.City have won more games (10) and more points (32) since the beginning of October than any other Women's Super League side.They sought a fast start here, Shaw flashing across the face of goal, Lauren Hemp dragging wide and Chloe Kelly almost finding the bottom corner. In contrast, struggling Spurs arrived on a seven-match losing streak, the worst in their history.Any assumptions about a straightforward home win were ended when Bizet slotted the visitors into the lead midway through the first half.At that point keeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela was proving unbeatable, pulling off outstanding saves to deny Shaw (twice) and Kelly.However, WSL top scorer Shaw was not to be denied, with quickfire goals before and after half-time breaking Spurs' resistance.Her first was a header after Korpela's save was recycled back into the box and her second, a confident stroke of a penalty following Ashleigh Neville's foul on Kelly.City were generally in control but on the break, Spurs should have equalised only for Nikola Karczewska spooned over after Rosella Ayane had been brilliantly denied by Ellie Roebuck.The points were secured when Shaw broke through two challenges and fired into the roof of net for her seventh goal in two games after netting four in the FA Cup last week at Bristol City. Defeat leaves Spurs 10th in the table and nervously contemplating the improving form of sides below them.Taylor reaches 100 not out as Shaw impressesTaylor was appointed in May 2020 after managing the men's academy team and has finished second and third during his two full seasons in charge.The former City striker has designs on going one better this campaign but faces a fierce challenge from champions Chelsea and leaders Manchester United, who earlier extended their lead at the top of the Women's Super League with a 5-1 victory over Leicester.This win moves City second, above Chelsea, who now have two games in hand as a result of playing in Sunday's League Cup final.Indeed, City still have both of their main title rivals left to play, with a visit to Old Trafford scheduled for the penultimate week of the season. To remain in contention, Taylor will need similarly threatening displays from Shaw, who had 11 shots in this game, five of them on target, and moved three goals clear of Aston Villa's Rachel Daly in the race to be top scorer.The Jamaica striker is an imposing target and her lethal form proved far too much for this fragile Spurs defence.After a trip to Brighton on Sunday, 12 March, City's following two WSL games are against Chelsea and Arsenal.Taylor will know much more about his side's title credentials after those fixtures.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64775014

Kelly Chambers' side have played a game more than Leicester and Tottenham and three more than Brighton though so remain in trouble.'It's like a family' - Chambers on life at ReadingWest Ham started the game strongly with Honoka Hayashi, Amalie Threstrup and Lucy Parker all having efforts saved by the impressive Grace Moloney.Reading grew into the game with Wellings volleying a glorious chance from five yards over the bar at the end of the first half.The opening exchanges of the second half were scrappy with both sides lacking quality and confidence.The first goal came after Rowe controlled a cross from the left and laid off for Wellings to fire home her third league goal of the season.West Ham's deserved equaliser was a moment of class from Atkinson, her ball cutting out the entire Reading defence to allow Asseyi to score the Hammers' first league goal of the calendar year. Rowe's late curler sparked joy among the Reading players, coaching staff and fans - and it could prove to have been a crucial moment as the season draws to a close over the next three months.

913,Tottenham 1-2 Man Utd: United return to WSL helm despite Ella Toone red card,SUN 12 Feb 2023,womens-super-league,"Manchester United made it 2-1 less than a minute after Bethany England had equalised for TottenhamManchester United manager Marc Skinner said he believes ""play acting"" from Spurs' Eveliina Summanen led to Ella Toone's sending off in their crucial victory at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.With United leading 2-1 in a nervy affair, England international Toone appeared to hit out at Summanen amid a scramble on the ground, leading to a straight red card.Summanen appeared to hold her face as the incident occurred in front of the touchline where Skinner was standing.""We want our players to show passion, commitment and energy,"" Skinner told Sky Sports.""It was play acting in my opinion. Obviously, with Ella [Toone] we'll look at that but I want to see that from her - I want to see passion in our players. ""It's something we'll work on internally because we have to be accountable. I will appeal that red card.""United returned to the top of the Women's Super League table after a dramatic and frantic second half in which they took the lead through Leah Galton.Shortly afterwards, Tottenham's January signing Bethany England scored in a third successive WSL game to make it 1-1, but team-mate Molly Bartrip diverted the ball into her own net less than a minute later.Toone's sending off followed but, despite the wild turn of events after the hour mark, United held on to claim a crucial victory, restoring their place at the top of the table and a one-point lead over Chelsea, who have a game in hand.Meanwhile, pressure is mounting on Tottenham and the side's manager Rehanne Skinner as their losing streak extends to seven WSL matches. Relive Sunday's Women's Super League action'Man Utd are developing that winning mentality'Pressure mounts as tensions run highElla Toone was sent off for hitting out at Eveliina Summanen in the second halfUnited dropped points in a 0-0 draw with Everton last weekend and knew they could not afford to do the same in London this week if they were to keep their title hopes on track.It was a frustrating first half for the visitors as Tottenham worked tirelessly out of possession and grew into the game as the break approached.England had an excellent chance to score for Spurs when she was played in by Ashleigh Neville, a constant threat for the hosts, and United came close when Galton fired over the bar.United came out of the blocks with more fluidity in the second half and Toone struck the outside of the post after captain Katie Zelem whipped a free-kick dangerously wide.A frantic turn of events followed as Galton capitalised on a smart cross from Ona Batlle and, minutes later, England's superb strike nestled into the far corner: 1-1.Bartrip, who was in tears at full-time, pulled her shirt over her head immediately after poking Batlle's cross into the roof of her own net seconds later.With the atmosphere in the stadium dialled up and both sets of players lunging into desperate tackles, Toone's shocking reaction to a scramble with Summanen led to angry reactions from the touchline and on the pitch.She went straight down the tunnel after being sent off but her team-mates quickly composed themselves to see out an important victory. Tottenham's players were visibility disappointed at full-time but this was a better performance than they have shown in recent weeks and they tested a United side who have been battling at the top all season.In England, Spurs have a striker capable of turning games around and they will feel they have enough quality to avoid relegation despite being dragged dangerously close to the bottom.""We showed belief and confidence from the first whistle to the last,"" said Rehanne Skinner, asked if she was concerned by the seven-game losing streak. ""Since I came [to Tottenham] we were always on a journey of building a team. The first half of the season didn't go to plan for loads of different reasons. ""We have to start to get pieces of the jigsaw together. We had two great transfers in the window that have helped us move forward.

She then timed her run perfectly - arriving late into the box - to score Villa's third, before bursting through the middle of the pitch to finish from Hanson's ball over the top for their fifth.Kirsty Hanson scored the second of three Aston Villa goals in the space of eight minutesThe way in which they dealt with Brighton was reminiscent of the top four-clubs. Villa certainly have the quality, they just need the consistency to go with it.After all, they struggled to a 1-1 draw with the same Brighton team just last week. However, after righting those wrongs in such style, when they return from the international break they can look to cement their position as 'the best of the rest' before focusing on loftier ambitions in future.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62784257

""Everybody said it was gone, it was done. People were almost playing as a build-up to next season.""This group is far from done. We've got a lot of points left in us yet, I think. I think it will be really sweet come the end of the season when we've proven a lot of people wrong.""Liverpool looked sluggish for most of the first half after their slow start to the game but came out re-energised after the break and put Leicester under continued pressure.Their best chance of the game went begging as Ceri Holland was denied by Janina Leitzig inside the six -yard box before substitute Natasha Dowie hit the crossbar with the rebound, while Missy Bo Kearns came agonisingly close in injury time.And a Leicester side who seemed reassured by their early goal remained composed in the face of pressure as they clung on to secure only their second victory of the season. The Foxes, who have six points, now sit one point behind second-bottom Reading with a game in hand. Liverpool are eighth with 11.""The three points is huge,"" Kirk added. ""I think the biggest thing today was the girls have seen and felt that you don't always need to play well to get three points.""It wasn't pretty, it was definitely relentless [from Liverpool] and we needed that. We spoke this morning about how the match is about 12% of your working week and it's about how hard you're working the rest is how you get these results.""They're working so, so hard in training, so diligently in everything they do. That's the reward you get."" Relive Sunday's Women's Super League actionLiverpool's slow start proves costlyLeicester City goalkeeper Leitzig, on loan from Bayern Munich, set a WSL record last weekend when she made 16 saves against Manchester City.Sunday's first half could not have been more different as she was rarely tested by Liverpool's front line.The Reds' top scorer, Katie Stengel, was isolated at the top of the attack and didn't even have a touch in Leicester's penalty area before she was substituted in the 61st minute.Slow starts have plagued Liverpool's campaign, with them failing to score a first-half goal in nine of their 13 league games.It has been the same situation in defence, with their six goals conceded in the first 15 minutes of games the most of any club.""We can't keep waiting until half-time to do it,"" Liverpool manager Matt Beard said.""We've worked well all week, we've had a great week in training, and then you go out and don't do it and that's super frustrating. We've just got to take this one on the chin.""Their second half brought about a fightback as the introduction of Dowie and Sofie Lundgaard helped to light a fire in their front line.Kearns also tested the visitors' defence, having a shot cleared off the line deep into added time as it looked as if Liverpool were destined for a leveller.Beard added: ""It was a frustrating afternoon. We created so much today and we shouldn't have lost the game.""If you don't take your chances... and it's been our Achilles heel in some of our games this year... but you can't change it now it's happened.""We've had three or four clear-cut chances today and you'd expect us to convert at least two of them if you're going to go on average.""Yet Leicester only had to face five shots on target and scurried after the ball at every available opportunity as they looked to stave off the threat of the drop.Manchester City loanee Ruby Mace acted as a steadying presence at the base of the visitors' midfield and the rest of the defence remained persistent in their pressure to crush Liverpool's hopes of scoring.Leicester's fighting spirit enabled them to grind out result that keeps alive their dream of securing WSL safety.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63849448

England international Lotte Wubben-Moy, substituted at half-time, gifted City a chance only for WSL top scorer Shaw to be denied by Zinsberger.The Austrian also did well to keep out efforts from Filippa Angeldahl and another shot from Shaw.However, there was nothing Zinsberger could do just before the break when Kelly got her second WSL goal since scoring the winner for England in the Euro 2022 final against Germany.Eidevall made a double substitution at the break, with Lia Walti and Katie McCabe replacing Wubben-Moy and Caitlin Foord.Within five minutes of the restart Arsenal nearly got a goal back but Blackstenius, who scored the only goal in the match between these sides on Wednesday, hit the post.Souza's header pulled one back but, without long-term injury absentees Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema - both out with serious knee injuries - they were unable to create a chance for an equaliser as the hosts collected a deserved three points.Rafaelle Souza's goal was her second in the Women's Super League this season",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62784256

We created enough chances to win the game. We have to be ready to take them,"" said United boss Skinner.""Our players want to hold accountability because they want to be the best team in the country. They know what chances they missed and they will own them. ""We are growing fast but there are moments you still need to put those bits of quality into play. We need to use it in the right way to fuel us.""United punished for missed chancesThis could prove to be a significant result in the title race as United did more than enough to pick up all three points but lacked ruthlessness.Alessia Russo had dominated the headlines this week after United turned down two world-record bids from Arsenal to sign the England striker in the final 24 hours of the January transfer window.But Russo, who poked wide a chance in the first half, was kept at bay by Everton's brave defence.Brian Sorensen's Everton side were tested throughout as forwards Garcia and Russo and full-back Ona Batlle came close in the first half before an onslaught from United in the second half.Toone had the best of the chances when she was teed up by winger Leah Galton, only managing to clip the outside of the post.United pushed up searching for a winner as a crowd of more than 5,000 grew more anxious and a few mistakes at the back almost allowed Everton to take a shock lead.Park, who looked threatening whenever she got the ball, rounded goalkeeper Mary Earps after a mistake from Batlle but sliced a golden opportunity to put the Blues 1-0 up with time running out.Everton continued to hang on as they threw their bodies in the way to block countless shots from United, with goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan putting in a strong display in the absence of on-loan United keeper Emily Ramsey, who was ineligible to face her parent club.""I'm really pleased with the overall performance and it shows how far this group has come to come here and take a point off this really good team,"" said Sorensen.""We knew they would open up as they really wanted to win and Jess (Park) had two good opportunities but she was tired. If we get used to this type of intensity then she will put those in the net.""The squad is looking really good and where I want it to be. It was about getting a result defensively and to be organised and we were that.""The result leaves the door open for United's rivals in the title race, and was another strong defensive display from an Everton side ever-improving under manager Sorensen.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64442936

I thought it was sloppy from us defensively,"" she told BBC Two after the game.""Both goals we could've prevented as a result of us switching off. We can control those things and we as a team have to be mindful of that.""This is a tough league and to everybody who thinks it's going to be near-perfect performances, it's not. It's going to be a grind to the end and I'm happy to have three points.""Jess Carter headed the Blues in front after seven minutes, however they were pegged back when Bethany England scored against her former club.Lauren James cut inside and fired in off the post to restore Chelsea's advantage, before Guro Reiten secured the win.However Nikola Karczewska's late strike ensured a nervy finish for Chelsea, which annoyed Hayes.Chelsea are unbeaten in 19 matches in all competitions, having not lost since a 3-2 defeat by Liverpool in their opening game of this season.They condemned Spurs to a sixth straight defeat in the league, while Chelsea have now won all seven of their WSL matches against their London rivals.Chelsea back on top - but Hayes dissatisfiedHaving dropped points for only the second time in this WSL campaign last time out at Arsenal, Chelsea started well and deservedly took an early lead at Brisbane Road.A well-worked move from a corner saw Erin Cuthbert cross in from the edge of the box and an unmarked Carter headed home the opener.It was a case of deja vu for Spurs, who have been in rotten league form and had scored just twice while conceding 15 in six previous top-flight games against Chelsea.Their losing run in the WSL is their worst in the competition and they had failed to score in their past three matches.Carter's goal was the fifth they have conceded in the opening 15 minutes of WSL games this season - more than any other side.'Outstanding goal!' - James gives Chelsea 2-1 leadEngland scores but Spurs woes continueTo remedy their scoring woes, Spurs boss Rehanne Skinner signed England from Chelsea for a reported £250,000 - a record between two WSL clubs - and the Euro 2022 winner showed her value on 16 minutes.The equaliser came against the run of play with Tottenham's first move forward of note. Ashleigh Neville slid the ball to Drew Spence who beat her marker before slotting in England, who tapped home before declining to celebrate against her old team.England levels for Spurs against former teamSigning England has given Spurs much more of an attacking threat. However, they remain vulnerable in defence, as James proved.On 27 minutes, she ran unchallenged from the wing into the centre of the pitch and restored Chelsea's lead with a fine individual goal from the edge of the box, which owed plenty to Spurs failing to put James under pressureChelsea were then able to keep Spurs at arms length before bagging a third on the hour, Sam Kerr flicking a long ball into the path of Reiten who slotted the ball into the bottom corner.Karczewska gave Spurs hope with two minutes to play with a fine low finish, but Chelsea held on to move top.Hayes said: ""I thought it was a scrappy game. The pitch made the conditions like that. I thought in the first half we didn't create enough depth to have the control we wanted, I felt we played ourselves into trouble.""It's one of those games that you know across the course of the season you've got to grind out a result. The important thing was the three points. Was it perfect? No. But it is about three points and we did enough for that to happen.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64442928

We grew into more control in the second half.""We definitely deserved to win today from an opportunities standpoint - but if you don't score, you won't win.""West Ham stay seventh, having drawn for the first time in 18 WSL fixtures.Frustration for misfiring Gunners In what has been shaping up as a fascinating title race, this Sunday could not have gone better for Emma Hayes' Chelsea.Having seen Manchester United drop points at home to Everton, they won at Tottenham before watching Arsenal huff and puff but fail to blow West Ham down.This was the first time Arsenal had failed to score in a WSL game since a goalless draw with Hayes' Blues in February last year, in a title race where they were eventually edged out on the final day.Arsenal drew headlines with their attempts to sign Russo for a world record £500,000 fee on deadline day.Their reasons for doing so became more obvious in this game, with Caitlin Foord summing up their struggles by misjudging a chip when clean through late on, sending it into the stands.It is too early to make projections this season, but in a league as competitive as the WSL, dropping two points here could cost Eidevall's side.The Swedish coach looked to be positive afterwards, saying: ""I can't fault the performance. We had great energy, great momentum - and if we can keep that, I have good feelings about this team.""I don't think it was their [West Ham's] choice to have 10 players behind the ball. I think we were controlling them very well and forcing them back.""I think we were lacking the final quality today but I would have been far more worried if we didn't create those opportunities.""West Ham became the first side in 12 months to stop Arsenal scoring in the WSLSmart Hammers defend for drawWest Ham had lost all eight of their previous WSL meetings with Arsenal, while the Gunners had won all three away top-flight matches against the Hammers, scoring 15 goals in the process.With Eidevall's charges having won their past eight WSL away matches, more punishment appeared on the cards - but West Ham are much more resolute these days, and manager Paul Konchesky got his tactics spot on.He told BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra: ""I think the whole back four and the goalkeeper were fantastic. We knew it was going to be hard but everyone put in a shift from the players that started, the ones that came off the bench and those who were in the stands supporting the team. They were all fantastic.""We normally start quite badly in the second half but we were fantastic and at 0-0 you have always got a chance. We gave it a good go and maybe on another day we could have got all three points.""They went toe-to-toe with Arsenal at the start, looking to press high and refusing to invite too much pressure. In the second half they began to sit deeper, as Arsenal grew tired and frustrated.When the home defence was breached, the visitors found Arnold in superb form.She saved twice from Frida Maanum in the first half, and after the break denied Stina Blackstenius with her leg before smothering at the forward's feet, then making a fine scrambling stop to keep out Rafaelle Souza's flicked effort.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64442925

Villa are spearheaded by Daly, who with nine goals in 11 WSL matches prior to Saturday was level at the top of the league scoring charts with Manchester City's Khadija Shaw.Both sides have also been liable to concede this season - Brighton had let in at least three goals in each of their past five WSL matches, 21 in total, while Villa had conceded 29 in their previous 13 WSL games.However, neither side looked like scoring for the majority of the first half, as Daly was effectively targeted and shut down by a physical Brighton team who themselves lacked a cutting edge.The game needed either a moment of magic or an error - and it got the latter. Sarah Mayling sent in a lofted cross and Brighton keeper Megan Walsh came out of her goal to try and punch it away.She didn't manage to get a hand to it and it was rotten luck for Seagulls midfielder Green, as the ball bounced off her thigh and into the net.Walsh redeemed herself slightly just before half-time, palming up a Kenza Dali shot, before getting a slice of luck this time as the ball dropped down on to the crossbar before bouncing behind.It proved crucial for Brighton in this game - and could be vital come the end of the season.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64436107

On a freezing afternoon in Merseyside, which led to a delayed kick-off, the Toffees quickly gave their fans something to cheer about when Karen Holmgaard headed in the opener after three minutes.West Ham barely had time to settle before Everton doubled their advantage in the 12th minute when Megan Finnigan capitalised from a smart corner routine.Everton continued to dominate and victory was confirmed in the second half when substitute Aggie Beever-Jones thumped in a superb third goal, adding to a miserable day for West Ham.The Toffees had the best chances throughout with defender Gabby George having a shot blocked by Grace Fisk after scuffing an effort wide under pressure from Kate Longhurst in a busy first half.Everton were threatening down the right-hand side in particular, with Nicoline Sorensen impressing and Jess Park causing problems.Paul Konchesky's West Ham side eventually settled and found Lisa Evans in space out wide but forward Dagny Brynjarsdottir was largely starved of service in a frustrating opening 45 minutes for the Hammers.The second half was not much better for the visitors as Everton almost scored again within seconds of the restart when Park slid a dangerous ball across the six-yard area and Kirsty Smith had to react.On-loan Blues goalkeeper Emily Ramsey was tested on set-pieces but was relatively unfazed overall as Everton won comfortably in an impressive performance. The result sees Everton jump up to fifth in the table, continuing their development under manager Brian Sorensen, while West Ham remain in seventh place.Missed opportunity for HammersBoth teams have progressed this season having been taken over by new management in the summer and this was a good test to see just how much they had developed.West Ham's form has been a little patchy in recent weeks and Everton boss Sorensen said before the game that this made them ""dangerous"" and ""unpredictable"" - but the Blues caught them on an off day. From the first minute, Konchesky's side looked disorganised off the ball and sloppy on it.Everton capitalised early on and quickly grew in confidence as defenders Finnigan and Rikke Sevecke stepped out from the back to offer support to the wingers.Park, one of the WSL's outstanding performers this season, was impressive once again and selfless in the final third, while Hanna Bennison dictated play in the centre.West Ham still carried a threat on set-pieces and French striker Viviane Asseyi posed more of a nuisance in the second half. They were also boosted by the return of versatile defender Lucy Parker from a lengthy injury but, on the whole, it was a disappointing afternoon for the Hammers. They showed at times why they have been making strides this season but this was a missed opportunity for them to stamp their authority on a close rival in the standings.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64279739

We're pushing and we're going to keep pushing for every game that the season gives us to be challenging for a title.""Persistence pays off for Man UtdWhile they fought hard, there were times when Kelly Chambers' side simply could not cope with the pace and precision of United's play.However, the finishing was not so clinical and before Williams' intervention, it was beginning to look as though they would have to settle for a point.Burns was called into action six times during a breathless first half and it should have been more as Russo, Garcia, Parris and Ella Toone combined brilliantly to slice through the home defence.Too often, though, the final pass or the finish was lacking. When it wasn't, they found an inspired Burns in the way and on the occasions even she looked beaten, a blue and white shirt would appear to block the shot.Reading were clinging on by their fingertips but were offering enough of a threat on the counter to keep United honest, especially as the game entered the last 15 minutes.It took a smart save from Mary Earps to keep out Justine Vanhaevermaet's glancing header but the scare did not quell the away side's attacking intent.They continued to pour forward, risking defeat in their pursuit of victory, and - eventually - they were rewarded.""I'm gutted. We deserved something out of the game today,"" Chambers told BBC Radio Berkshire.""The way we conceded was really disappointing because you could see when we conceded that the girls just fell to their knees, they were gutted. For me, it's a performance to be proud of but a result to be disappointed about.""There is a long way to go in the race for the WSL title but if United do emerge victorious, as much as thumping wins like last weekend's 6-0 thrashing of Liverpool, it is games like this that will have taken them there.""Reading made it so difficult for us,"" Skinner added.""We knew it would be last 20 minutes but they made it so, so difficult for us.

It is a big point, City are a very, very good side,"" said Ward. ""But there were definitely a few moments there where if we sharpened up in the final third we could have taken one or two of those chances. But it was a collective team performance.""We will be going home happy tonight but there's still things to improve and kick on.""For City, the draw extends their unbeaten run to 13 games in all competitions. But Gareth Taylor's side have little margin for error as they attempt to chase down the top three, and the two dropped points could prove costly.They started the game on the front foot, with Shaw having three shots from inside the area blocked in quick succession by Villa defender Danielle Turner before Chole Kelly rocketed a shot into the side-netting from a tight angle.As well as being a threat in the box, Shaw's hold-up play was troubling the Villa backline and led to the opening goal on 28 minutes.The 25-year-old dropped deep before rolling her marker and sliding the ball through the heart of the Villa defence for Castellanos, who calmly side-footed home her first WSL goal.Villa had offered little as an attacking threat at that stage but managed to level just two minutes later when Daly's cross fell for Hanson - her half-volley from close range had too much power for Roebuck, who got two hands on the ball but could not prevent it from looping into the net.Villa started the second half the better team and came within inches of taking the lead when Hanson hit the post with a curling shot from inside the area.Dali, who was superb in central midfield, then went close with a snap half-volley from distance that was well pushed away by Roebuck.City thought they had snatched a late winner but Anna Leat did well to block Shaw's effort from close range in stoppage time.""I thought it was flat,"" Taylor told Sky Sports. ""Even before we scored we were a bit slow to everything - slow in our play, in our reactions. We score a good goal and give a cheap one away soon afterwards.""We weren't clicking, not much cohesion. To come away against a decent Villa team with a point is better than losing the game.""You can't worry about dropping a point. We're still unbeaten, that's a positive for us.

It was a cagey game. My team showed tremendous character, to get a point when not at our best.""The quality of chances was woeful - our attacking players didn't create a lot. But to stay switched on is such an attribute.""Ultimately, the red majority of the crowd - just shy of the WSL record 47,367 who attended Arsenal's 4-0 win over Tottenham in September - were sent home wondering what might have been.""You have to keep two thoughts - be happy with the performance but be disappointed in the result,"" Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall said.""It is more important to get the performance right in the long term. We need to draw strength from this.""Kerr saves below-par ChelseaThis was Arsenal's first WSL game since Vivianne Miedema was ruled out for 2022-23 with knee ligament damage, while Beth Mead suffered her season-ending ACL injury the last time the Gunners played at the Emirates.For long periods Arsenal looked like they missed the star pairing, creating plenty of chances with no cutting edge - until Charles clumsily felled Foord just inside the penalty area.The foul began outside the area, but the spot-kick was given by referee Emily Heaslip as the final contact was inside.""The ref gave it for tangling legs in the box, which is unavoidable,"" Hayes said. ""VAR needs to be in the game to confirm or deny that.""Little has had injury woes of her own this campaign, but the midfielder was nerveless in sending Zecira Musovic the wrong way with her spot-kick.Arsenal came close to a second when Steph Catley's attempted cross almost caught out Musovic, who scrambled to tip the ball on to the bar.Also back for Arsenal following injury is Leah Williamson, the England centre-back leading the home defence in quelling the Chelsea attack - until the 89th minute.Kerr escaped her marker and powered a header home from six yards, delivering the result that substitute Jelena Cankovic's perfect delivery deserved.It was the 32nd goal Chelsea have scored in 11 WSL games, and few have been as wildly celebrated by the bench, Hayes leaping to her feet and punching the air.She said of Kerr: ""No-one in the world can score the number of goals she has. The standout attribute is that she doesn't lose focus at any point.""She knows it takes one chance, and the ball from Jelena was world-class. So was the header.""Arsenal drop points against title rivals - againA midday kick-off, it was a bright and early start for both teams on Sunday - and Arsenal were out of bed straight away and pressing Chelsea high up the pitch.Erin Cuthbert and Millie Bright were guilty of giving the ball away around their own box, and Arsenal created the bulk of the first-half chances. Frida Maanum and Foord shot straight at Musovic, while Lina Hurtig found the side-netting.However, Arsenal never truly tested Musovic in the first half, while the Blues struggled to create anything early on, save for livewire Lauren James making a 40-yard run and zipping a shot just wide of the far post.Last season only a point separated these sides, while both clubs had lost only one match this campaign. Such tight margins led to a tight game.Arsenal have dropped points against Chelsea and Manchester United - their two main title rivals - from winning positions at home.There were worrying scenes of crowding outside the stadium and many supporters only reached their seats well after kick-off following huge queues.An Arsenal statement read: ""An early kick-off, combined with a number of new supporters to our stadium, coupled with 50% of supporters arriving in the last 20 minutes before kick-off, resulted in busy turnstile areas.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64201132

The passing was crisp and purposeful, leading to a number of presentable opportunities.At the heart of it were the exciting Park and Hanna Bennison - aged 21 and 20 respectively - who were always looking to get Everton moving forward with an incisive pass or driving run.Reading found a way back into the match from set-pieces, but Everton remained far more threatening from open play.Although Park is set to return to Manchester City when her loan expires at the end of the season, Bennison's development gives Everton plenty of reason for optimism.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64201136

""We'll keep fighting, fighting, fighting: 12 games to go and then the cup as well.""Can we [win the League]? Of course we can. Do we want to? Absolutely, certainly we want to.""United started their first game of 2023 in fine fashion as Garcia coupled with fellow Spain international Ona Batlle to put her side in front in the sixth minute - Garcia's goal-bound effort taking a wicked deflection off Gemma Bonner as it got the better of Liverpool goalkeeper Rachael Laws.Marc Skinner's side started well and placed the visitors under continual pressure with Hannah Blundell narrowly missing out on doubling United's advantage minutes later as she shot wide when left free inside the box.They got their second of the afternoon after a Liverpool error; Ella Toone taking advantage as Ladd dispossessed Ceri Holland to thread through to Russo, who tucked her excellent first-time finish into the bottom corner.WSL: Alessia Russo extends Man Utd's lead to 2-0 against Liverpool with 'brilliant' strikeLadd then made it three as she redirected a pinpoint lofted Batlle ball past Laws.Liverpool were improved in the second half and won a number of set-pieces in dangerous positions.But their improvements did not dent United's swagger and they made it four after Koivisto turned a Millie Turner effort into her own net before substitute Martha Thomas added a fifth from close range.Rachel Williams added another nail in the coffin for Liverpool in the 84th minute, nodding home Ladd's cross.Liverpool boss Matt Beard called his side's thrashing ""embarrassing"" and apologised to the fans.""We should be embarrassed by it because I am,"" he said. ""It's not as if we're a poor team because we've competed so well this year. I can't understand this 90 minutes.""I apologise for the performance to the fans. I don't care whether it's Manchester United, whether it's Chelsea, whether it's Manchester City, we should not be losing matches 6-0 at this level.""United in fine form as title charge continuesUnited manager Skinner made it clear his side could not afford to drop points before the match, telling BBC One: ""I want us to perform today, I want to see a true Manchester United performance.""And perform his side did. Seemingly re-energised after 28 days without a competitive match, they played with high intensity from minute one and were undaunted by a Liverpool side who beat Chelsea earlier this season.They were particularly dominant on the right wing with Batlle, who created three of the goals, and Garcia regularly proving too much for the visitors to handle.Toone, who assisted two, continually had the better of the Liverpool defence.The Reds made the most of the advantage handed to them in the title race by Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Chelsea earlier in the afternoon and now sit three points off the top spot with a game in hand.First-half woes blight Liverpool againThe first half proved to be Liverpool's undoing once again with them facing an insurmountable battle by the time Beard delivered his half-time team-talk.Fourteen of the 22 goals they have conceded this season have come before the break, while United remain yet to concede in the opening 45 minutes.Liverpool's start was shaky with wayward passes and a lack of awareness in their defensive third handing United goalscoring opportunities.The first half set the tone for an uphill battle for the Merseyside club and they did little in the way of troubling United, failing to muster a single shot on target.They come up against league leaders Chelsea in the WSL next weekend before the Reds face them once again in the FA Cup third round.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64201133

Brighton remain 11th after Jens Scheuer's first game in charge, four points clear of bottom side Leicester.Leicester had only scored two WSL goals in their opening nine games this season, and these were their first at home since a 2-1 defeat to Spurs on the opening day in September.The Foxes had started the campaign with nine successive defeats for the second season running, but avoid becoming the third WSL team to lose their first 10 games, after Doncaster in 2016 (15) and Yeovil Town in 2017-18 (12).Impressive Foxes send warningBased on this game it is hard to understand why the Foxes are bottom of the league and were yet to take a point this season. They were full of energy and creativity going forward, with Hannah Cain dragging an effort wide before Missy Goodwin cut in from the left and curled just wide of the far post. Willie Kirk's side took a deserved lead when Whelan, who joined Leicester this summer after almost five years at Brighton, latched on to a Tierney lay-off and slotted into the corner from 16 yards out.Tierney made Leicester's position more dominant when she scrambled home in the six-yard box, after Jemma Purfield's cross was twice flicked on. Robinson scored the best goal of the lot, just moments after coming off the bench, with her side-footed finish a touch of class.The win ends a run of 10 defeats in the WSL overall and earns a first league win since February, with 15 defeats and one draw in that time.Defensive problems for Brighton This defeat is likely to concern former Bayern Munich coach Scheuer, who was announced as Hope Powell's permanent replacement during the WSL's winter break.He has spoken about wanting to bring defensive stability to Brighton, before playing high-intensity football. This performance brought neither.They handed debuts to January signings Guro Bergsvand, Dejana Stefanovic and Zoe Morse, with Brianna Visalli also coming on to replace the injured Stefanovic in the first half. It has been 13 games since they kept a clean sheet, and they have conceded 44 goals in that time.They offered little going forward, apart from when Maisie Symonds was twice denied by new Leicester goalkeeper Janina Leitzig in the closing stages, and were regularly cut open defensively.Meet Jens Scheuer: Brighton's new motivator",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64201134

I thought her all-round game was excellent. She's a real asset for us.""City's win extends their unbeaten run to 11 matches in all competitions and sees them close the gap on third-placed Arsenal.City keep themselves in title contentionBack-to-back defeats to start their WSL campaign has left City playing catch-up this season with Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal storming ahead.However, they are unbeaten since a 2-0 reverse at Chelsea late in September and following the 1-1 draw between Arsenal and leaders Chelsea, they are now only six points off top spot with a game in hand.""When you win games you build confidence,"" Shaw said. ""It's a new team, so we kept believing. Once you're winning and scoring goals the momentum comes.""For all their dominance in the first period, the visitors required some luck to go into half-time level as Leila Ouahabi cleared Grace Fisk's shot off the line during a goalmouth scramble before Ellie Roebuck saved from Risa Shimizu after Taylor's team switched off at a throw-in.A goalmouth scramble was as close as West Ham came to breaching the Manchester City defenceThe threat before the break had come from England pair Chloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp on the wings but when the goal came, it was an arrow through the heart of the West Ham defence.Yui Hasegawa's incisive pass took out two West Ham players and Castellanos did for the rest as she opened up her body to slide a perfectly-weighted through ball into the path of Shaw.It was a goal of the highest class to break a stubborn West Ham backline and while Shaw had the chance to make the final minutes more comfortable, one was enough to keep City in touch with those above them.Relive the action from West Ham v Man City in the WSL",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64201131

There was also plenty of focus on Lucy Staniforth and Jordan Nobbs, who started in midfield for Villa following moves from Manchester United and Arsenal respectively.However, it was Daly who proved decisive as she scored her ninth WSL goal of the season to move clear at the top of the scoring charts, ahead of Manchester City's Khadija Shaw.It continues Daly's push to start up front for England, having played at left-back so far under Sarina Wiegman, including every game of the Euros triumph last summer.Her goals have now been worth 10 points to her club, and her nine goals also account for 60% of the 15 they have scored in the league so far this season.England might be worth £250,000, but Daly is priceless for Villa manager Carla Ward and her team.Five in a row for sorry SpursBethany England (right) scored on her first appearance for Tottenham after joining from ChelseaEngland put Tottenham ahead in rainy and blustery conditions at Bescot Stadium, the first goal Spurs have scored in five WSL games.The England striker swept home a Chioma Ubogagu cross from six yards after 28 minutes, to show quality she was unable to demonstrate from the Chelsea bench.However, she could not stop the rot as Spurs slid to a fifth successive league defeat, proving the problems run far deeper for Rehanne Skinner's side.England's strike was the only time they ventured into the Villa box with real purpose in the first half, and after the break they failed to offer any greater threat until the 89th minute, when England skewed over from 12 yards when she should have found the target.They have issues in goal - Tinja-Riikka Korpela replaced Becky Spencer, who conceded three to Everton in the final WSL game of 2022, but she was culpable for Dali's first as she misjudged the shot from the edge of the D.Spurs also lack creativity without Ashleigh Neville, absent here after being sent off against Everton. No defender has scored more (three) or been involved in more goals (five) in the WSL this season than Neville.Villa rise into the top half with this win, while Spurs are now entrenched in the bottom six.

The absence of winger Leah Galton from Skinner's side left them lacking impetus in the final third at times, while Russo was also regularly left isolated up front.The Red Devils may still be a work in progress but reaching the FA Cup last four for the first time in their history is an important milestone for the club nevertheless.United will find out their semi-final opponents in Tuesday's draw, which takes place on Morning Live on BBC One.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65006949

After a behind-closed-doors friendly with Germany earlier in the camp, Pauw's team were playing their first official friendly since November while China, ranked 14th in the world, were playing only their second game in seven months.It was Birmingham City defender Quinn who came closest to breaking the deadlock when her powerful header rattled the crossbar from McCabe's corner midway through the half.Linhwei Yao, who was earlier booked for a scything challenge on Denise O'Sullivan, tested the gloves of Courtney Brosnan from a well-worked short corner, but Quinn was involved again as the Republic recycled the ball following Megan Campbell's long throw, and the defender's looping header was gathered by Huan Xu.US-born Marissa Sheva, 25, was handed her debut by Pauw as one of three half-time substitutes, but it was centurion Quinn who was called into action at the other end when she blocked Lin Yan Zhang's goal-bound shot.After a lull in proceedings, both sides had goals ruled out in the matter of three minutes. Xiao Yuyi scored on 61 minutes but the assistant referee flagged for offside, before Xu punched into her net from an Irish corner and was a touch fortunate that Jason Barcello's whistle for a foul saved her from an embarrassing own goal.Brosnan pulled off a superb point-blank save to deny Jiahui Lou from close range after a mix-up in the Irish defence and Megan Campbell's free-kick failed to trouble Xu in the closing stages.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64733762

957,England 6-1 Belgium: Lionesses retain Arnold Clark Cup with win over Belgium,WED 22 Feb 2023,arnold-clark-cup,"England scored 12 goals in the tournament and only conceded twiceEngland have successfully defended the Arnold Clark Cup after a thumping victory over Belgium made it three wins from three games in the tournament.The Lionesses, now unbeaten in 29 matches, were on top throughout at Ashton Gate, needing only a draw to seal the title. The familiar image of captain Leah Williamson lifting a trophy afterwards - her third in 12 months - was met by huge cheers, followed by a chorus of 'Sweet Caroline' which became synonymous with England's Euro 2022 triumph.Williamson had a superb evening, getting on the scoresheet twice, as the hosts dominated from the outset and brushed Belgium aside.Manchester City winger Chloe Kelly, who scored the winning goal in the Euro 2022 final, also netted twice to finish as the tournament's top scorer.In a busy ending, Lucy Bronze poked in Rachel Daly's knockdown and former Bristol City midfielder Julie Biesmans diverted into her own net to add to England's tally, while Elena Dhont's superb curling strike for Belgium prevented a clean sheet for Mary Earps.England's preparations for the Women's World Cup continue to go smoothly. With just five months to go until the tournament kicks off in Australia and New Zealand, the Lionesses have maintained winning momentum and are still yet to lose under manager Sarina Wiegman.They conceded just two goals at the Arnold Clark Cup, the other in a narrow 2-1 win over Italy, who finished third behind Belgium and ahead of South Korea.Belgium manager Ives Serneels said: ""When England are good, it is hard to beat them. ""When they have difficult moments they have players on the bench at the same level. That is a real strength of their team.""England's Arnold Clark Cup win - as it happenedListen to the latest Football Daily podcastA guide to England's World Cup groupEngland entertain as wingers cause havocWiegman wanted to use this tournament to experiment with personnel and she made 18 changes to the starting XI across the three matches, but it made no difference to the outcome.England, ranked fourth in the world, were heavy favourites against lower-ranked opposition and showed their superiority from the first whistle against Belgium.Knowing they needed only a point to win the tournament for a second year running, they got off to the perfect start when Lauren James' dangerous run deflected fortuitously for Kelly to tap-in on the goalline in the 12th minute.James, who was rightly awarded player of the tournament, was a constant menace and Belgium could not handle her creativity, directness and clever movement. ""It has been a great week, one I have dreamt about and I can't ask for any more,"" James told ITV afterwards. ""I have still got work to do but I have confidence at the moment and have to continue with that. It is an amazing feeling and I am just happy to be a part of it.""This tournament sets us on a good road, but we have to keep looking at each game as it comes and play well at the World Cup in the summer.""Kelly was equally as dangerous on the other flank, cutting inside and drawing saves from goalkeeper Nicky Evrard, who had a busy night in chilly Bristol. Chelsea defender Millie Bright, who finished top scorer at last year's tournament, had a chance to make it 2-0 in the first half when she headed over from a corner, while Alessia Russo spurned second-half opportunities for the hosts.The final minutes were frantic as Dhont's consolation strike was sandwiched between Bronze's goal and Williamson's second to round off an enjoyable encounter.The Lionesses entertained throughout with their attacking quality on full display, and confirmed their status as one of the world's most dangerous sides.""I think we are in a good place and the competition in the team is really strong,"" said Wiegman.""We still have five months to go but we know we have to step up more because the World Cup will be more of a challenge.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64718305
958,England 2-1 Italy: Rachel Daly double helps England avoid Italy scare,SUN 19 Feb 2023,arnold-clark-cup,"Rachel Daly has scored 10 goals in 13 appearances for Aston Villa in the Women's Super League this seasonRachel Daly scored twice as England survived a scare from Italy in Coventry to win their second match of the Arnold Clark Cup.The Aston Villa striker, 31, was given the nod up front in place of Manchester United's Alessia Russo and delivered with two crucial headers either side of the break. Daly nodded in Katie Robinson's cross to make it 1-0, but Italy rocked the hosts with a surprise equaliser in controversial fashion as Sofia Cantore bundled in a cross which appeared to go out of play.Despite protests from the Lionesses, including defender Maya Le Tissier who had slid in attempting to block the cross, there was no goalline technology at the CBS Arena to confirm the decision.England regrouped, however, with Daly once again providing a crucial impact, heading in substitute Lauren James' cross to restore their lead.Has Daly staked claim to be England's number nine?Reaction to England's win over Italy""I haven't seen the footage back but that's not really important. The decision had been made so we had to move on and score a second goal,"" said manager Sarina Wiegman.""Maybe the goal was out of bounds but we don't have VAR so you have to keep going."" Daly went off to a standing ovation shortly after scoring her second in front of 32,128 - a record attendance for a sporting event at the arena - and England comfortably held on to make it two wins from two in the tournament they won last year. Wiegman's side travel to Bristol on Wednesday for their final match against Belgium and success would seal the defence of their title just five months out from the Women's World Cup. Italy, who narrowly lost 2-1 to Belgium in their opening match, face South Korea next. Belgium, currently second in the group on goal difference, beat Korea 2-1 later on Sunday to set up a showdown for the title with England.England tested as Daly proves herself againDaly, used as a left-back throughout Euro 2022, has been a regular starter under Wiegman, but rarely used in the natural attacking role she plays for her club.However, her outstanding form for Villa this season, where she has scored 10 goals in 13 Women's Super League matches, has made it hard for the England boss to ignore. Daly came on as a substitute for forward Russo in the opening victory over South Korea and started at Coventry, given another opportunity to make her mark in her preferred position. She ultimately made the difference with her two strikes, but should have had more, missing several headers in both halves, having caused problems for the Italian defence with her high pressing. England on the whole were completely dominant, but were tested more than they had been in their 4-0 win over South Korea as goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck was forced into an early save from Valentina Giacinti.Defender Alex Greenwood, named captain with Leah Williamson an unused substitute, also had to use her pace to make a recovery tackle when Giacinti almost escaped with a ball over the top. Italy's ability to transition with pace caused some problems and their goal was a test of England's nerve.But Wiegman will be pleased with her side's response as they extended their unbeaten run to 28 matches and are in a strong position to win a third successive tournament under the Dutchwoman.""I think it's a good [lesson],"" she said. ""They equalised when we had controlled the game, but in that moment lost a little bit of control. ""To learn was really good but of course you don't want to concede and that's part of the game.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64688596

England had dominated possession and were cruising in the second half after Chloe Kelly made it 2-0 within 16 seconds of the restart, before Manchester United's Alessia Russo smartly dinked it past the goalkeeper at the near post.James' thumping strike late on sealed victory for the European champions, who won the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup tournament last year.Sarina Wiegman's side made light work of South Korea, ranked 15th in the world, and already move to the top of the standings on goal difference after Belgium's Tessa Wullaert scored a late winner to beat Italy 2-1 in the tournament opener earlier on Thursday. Victory also extends England's unbeaten run under Wiegman, going 674 days without defeat - their last coming in April 2021 - as they prepare for this summer's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.What is the Arnold Clark Cup?James impresses as Wiegman experiments England are heavy favourites to win the competition as the highest-ranked side and Wiegman was able to make several changes to the starting XI without seeing a drop-off in performance.James, who has been outstanding for Chelsea in the Women's Super League this season, was given an opportunity to show her creativity and did not disappoint.Her driving runs in the first half helped open up a stubborn South Korean defence, eventually forcing Jang Sel-gi into a foul to concede the penalty which Stanway made no error in putting away. The Chelsea forward's stature grew even more in the second half when she was involved in the build-up to Russo's goal, switching it across to Alex Greenwood with a burst of pace down the right-hand side, and capped off her performance with a first international goal in the 78th minute. Wiegman, who was without crucial midfielder Keira Walsh through illness, was able to look at several formations and introduced Manchester City's Laura Coombs in the second half - her first appearance for England in eight years.Captain Leah Williamson was also used in midfield and defence, giving a glimpse into Wiegman's options for the World Cup which kicks off in July.""I want to try out things. I think this tournament is really a big step in our preparation for the World Cup,"" said Wiegman.""We need to see where we are as a team and where individuals are in this moment. We will figure out more things and do some changes. ""The squad has lots of depth. We have some centre-backs who can play as full-backs and [in] those positions up front is lots of competition. I can't complain about the depth of this team. ""I don't like to have headaches but in this case I do.""England should have scored more - substitute Katie Robinson hit the post from close range, Stanway struck against the crossbar and Russo also hit the woodwork in the first half. But it was a night which further strengthened England's momentum, even without injured Euro top scorer Beth Mead and midfielder Walsh. Pitch conditions were not ideal as there were several occasions where the ball bobbled near the touchline and Wiegman later said it was ""unacceptable for this level"" - but it did not faze England.They take on Italy in Coventry next, before ending the tournament in Bristol against Belgium.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64650866
