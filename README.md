# Investigating the language used when reporting on men's and women's professional football

## Background
Women's professional sport has for a long time taken a back seat to the male equivalent and - at least in the UK - the same goes for football.  Indeed the Football Association (FA) banned women's football in 1921 seeing it as unladylike, a ban that would stand until around 1971 following pressure from UEFA.
