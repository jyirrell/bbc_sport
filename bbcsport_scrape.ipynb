       "'Ella Toone scored the opening goal as England beat Germany in the Euro 2022 finalAfter scoring one of the most important goals in English football history, Ella Toone made a surprising admission - she was \"gutted\" not to be wearing her eyelash extensions.Toone, who scored the opener in England\\'s Euro 2022 final victory over Germany with a marvellous chipped finish, has played a huge part in the explosion in popularity and attention for women\\'s football in the last few months.But the Manchester United midfielder is also keen not to let that added attention stop her from looking however she wants.Other women\\'s players have spoken about how they feel judged more on their looks than their footballing talent. Aston Villa midfielder Alisha Lehmann has been among those to express disappointmentexternal-link at being judged more for her Instagram output than her on-pitch achievements.But Toone, 23, says she is proud to be proving that when it comes to false lashes or football, there does not need to be a choice.\"I like that young girls can now look up to women like us,\" she told BBC Sport.\"I love getting my lashes done, my nails done. I always say: you feel good, you look good, you play good.\"I can still go out there and play football. There should be no stigma around the way you look and how you dress.\"Another aspect of women\\'s football in England is the close bond between players and fans - yet a side effect of the growth of the women\\'s game is the risk of losing that interaction. Toone is less able to stop for selfies and sign shirts when they play at Old Trafford compared with the games at Leigh Sports Village.\"Women\\'s football is very different, we connect with fans so much more,\" says Toone. \"The stadiums are usually much smaller so we\\'re used to being able to see everyone, sign shirts and take pictures, connect with everyone.\"As it continues to grow, that\\'s not sustainable any more. It\\'s about finding different ways to connect.\"Toone appears to have done that on social media, where she entertains her 265,000 TikTok followers with rap battles and funny phone calls with her nan. But she won\\'t let that distract her from her professional ambitions.\"Football is always first and I want to be remembered as a good footballer. If people connect with me away from football, that\\'s OK too.\"\\'We have a big target on our backs now\\'Toone has played in every WSL game for Manchester United this seasonIt is no wonder Toone wants to focus on football, with her club side Manchester United now firmly on the hunt for their first Women\\'s Super League title.The Tyldesley-born player first joined United as an eight-year-old, before leaving six years later due to a lack of a senior women\\'s side.When United did finally form a women\\'s team and entered the Championship in 2018, Toone was part of the original squad and she has been a fixture in their rise from the second tier to the top of the WSL.\"We\\'ve been building now for five years,\" she says. \"We want to perform well every weekend. We\\'ve strengthened really well, our depth is the best it has ever been. It\\'s really exciting.\"It was nice to be here from the start. Now we keep improving, hopefully keep performing well.\"Come the summer, focus will switch to the World Cup, where England begin their campaign on 22 July against Haiti in Brisbane.Since their history-making victory in the Euros last summer, being a Lioness comes with added pressure and expectations.\"It\\'s changed massively. A lot more people recognise me now,\" Toone says. \"But that\\'s part and parcel of it, more people recognise us. I try to take everything in my stride.\"We have a big target on our backs now. That\\'s the pressure we love. We go into each game wanting to do what we love - make the nation proud.\"Elon Musk\\'s Twitter Storm: Find out how the new owner is transforming the companyAre eco laundry products better for the environment?

       "'Miguel Almiron is Newcastle\\'s top scorer this season with 11 Premier League goals - more than in his previous four seasons combined for the clubNewcastle revived their bid to finish in the Premier League\\'s top four with a battling victory over Wolves at St James\\' Park.Substitute Miguel Almiron scored the winner with 12 minutes left as the Magpies ended a run of three straight defeats in all competitions to leapfrog Liverpool into fifth with a two-point lead and a game in hand, and move within four points of fourth-placed Tottenham, who have played two games more.Hwang Hee-chan, another substitute, had levelled for Wolves seconds after coming on to cancel out Alexander Isak\\'s towering first-half header.Wolves were second best for large periods but will feel aggrieved that they were not awarded a penalty, and that Nick Pope was not sent off, when the Newcastle goalkeeper appeared to take down Raul Jimenez six minutes before Isak\\'s opener, with referee Andy Madley waving away their appeals.Pope then went on to make a number of fine saves to deny Julen Lopetegui\\'s side, who stay 13th and miss the chance to move six points clear of the relegation zone.Live text coverage of Newcastle v Wolves and Sunday\\'s other Premier League gamesVisit our Newcastle United pageGo straight to our Wolves contentNewcastle end losing runSpeaking before the game, Eddie Howe said he hoped for a \"spark or individual moment\" to get his Newcastle team\\'s flagging season back on track and it arrived courtesy of top scorer Almiron, whose fine individual season continued with an 11th goal of the season.It is Newcastle\\'s first win in six games in all competitions and their first home win in the Premier League since a 1-0 victory over Fulham in mid-January.\"The first half performance in general was very good,\" Howe told Sky Sports after the game. \"Alexander Isak scored a massive goal for us. When it\\'s a one-goal lead, it\\'s very delicate. It should have been more at half-time.\"Wolves came back into the game, but the character shown by the group to go again and get the winning goal is a great feeling for us.\"After a quiet start, their opener arrived when Kieran Trippier\\'s dangerous free kick was met by Isak, who edged clear of his marker and buried a powerful header into the corner.That sparked Newcastle into life and they came close to a second goal when Bruno Guimaraes hit the bar with a header from close range after Dan Burn had helped Trippier\\'s corner back into the six-yard box.Trippier was guilty of a defensive error to allow Wolves to level in the second half when he slipped and collided with Pope as he attempted a clearance, the ball falling at the feet of Hwang, who tapped into an open net seconds after coming on to the pitch.After Almiron restored Newcastle\\'s lead, Sven Botman came close to a third in stoppage time when he blazed wide from six yards after some wonderful interplay between the Paraguayan and Guimaraes.Wolves rue non-penalty callThough Newcastle deserved their victory, Wolves will feel the decisive moment of the match went against them when it was still goalless.Pope miscontrolled a back pass that was intercepted by Jimenez and the Mexico striker appeared to be bodychecked by the England goalkeeper as he attempted to run on to the ball.Referee Madley, who was a considerable distance away, waved away their appeals and the video assistant referee did not ask the official to take a second look on the monitor.\"For me, we should have had a penalty. We are very unlucky with the referee,\" Lopetegui told Sky Sports.\"In the second half, we improved a lot. We changed a lot of things and were able to get at them.\"It was a pity that we had no changes left to make after they scored. We lost against a very good team.\"Despite going into the game as the Premier League\\'s lowest scorers, Wolves created a number of decent opportunities, with Daniel Podence hitting the post with a fizzing low drive shortly before the interval, while Pedro Neto and Joao Moutinho drew smart stops from Pope before Hwang\\'s equaliser.But the defeat, combined with results elsewhere over the weekend, has allowed a number of teams below Wolves to close the gap in what becoming an unpredictable relegation battle, with just five points separating the bottom nine.That makes Wolves\\' next two matches, against fellow strugglers Leeds and Nottingham Forest, hugely significant as they look to secure a fifth successive season in the top flight.Player of the matchRúben NevesRúben Neveswith an average of 7.80NewcastleNewcastle UnitedNewcastle UnitedWolvesWolverhampton WanderersWolverhampton WanderersNewcastle UnitedAvgSquad number14Player nameIsakAverage rating7.47Squad number24Player nameAlmirónAverage rating7.34Squad number2Player nameTrippierAverage rating7.14Squad number10Player nameSaint-MaximinAverage rating6.94Squad number39Player nameBruno GuimarãesAverage rating6.81Squad number28Player nameWillockAverage rating6.80Squad number5Player nameSchärAverage rating6.70Squad number23Player nameMurphyAverage rating6.68Squad number4Player nameBotmanAverage rating6.66Squad number33Player nameBurnAverage rating6.58Squad number22Player namePopeAverage rating6.30Squad number11Player nameRitchieAverage rating5.89Squad number9Player nameWilsonAverage rating5.85Squad number36Player nameS LongstaffAverage rating5.47Wolverhampton WanderersAvgSquad number8Player nameRúben NevesAverage rating7.80Squad number11Player nameHwang Hee-chanAverage rating6.83Squad number37Player nameTraoréAverage rating6.20Squad number15Player nameDawsonAverage rating6.17Squad number1Player nameJosé SáAverage rating6.11Squad number10Player nameDaniel PodenceAverage rating6.09Squad number9Player nameJiménezAverage rating6.07Squad number7Player namePedro NetoAverage rating6.02Squad number27Player nameMatheus NunesAverage rating5.99Squad number23Player nameKilmanAverage rating5.98Squad number5Player nameLeminaAverage rating5.97Squad number28Player nameJoão MoutinhoAverage rating5.97Squad number22Player nameNélson SemedoAverage rating5.91Squad number19Player nameJonnyAverage rating5.78Squad number3Player nameAït-NouriAverage rating5.74Squad number4Player nameCollinsAverage rating5.67Line-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsNewcastleFormation  4-3-322Pope2Trippier5Schär4Botman33Burn36S Longstaff39Bruno Guimarães28Willock23Murphy14Isak10Saint-Maximin22Pope2Trippier5Schär4Botman33Burn36S Longstaff39Bruno Guimarães28Willock23MurphySubstituted forRitchieat 85\\'minutes14IsakBooked at 68minsSubstituted forWilsonat 68\\'minutes10Saint-MaximinSubstituted forAlmirónat 68\\'minutesSubstitutes1Dúbravka3Dummett6Lascelles9Wilson11Ritchie13Targett19Manquillo24Almirón32AndersonWolvesFormation  4-2-3-11Sá22Nélson Semedo15Dawson23Kilman19Castro Otto8Neves5Lemina37Traoré28João Moutinho10Podence9Jiménez1Sá22Nélson SemedoBooked at 58mins15Dawson23Kilman19Castro OttoSubstituted forAït-Nouriat 69\\'minutes8NevesSubstituted forNunesat 68\\'minutes5Lemina37TraoréSubstituted forNetoat 45\\'minutes28João MoutinhoSubstituted forCollinsat 75\\'minutes10PodenceBooked at 44minsSubstituted forHwang Hee-chanat 69\\'minutes9JiménezSubstitutes3Aït-Nouri4Collins7Neto11Hwang Hee-chan12Matheus Cunha24Gomes25Bentley27Nunes35João GomesReferee:Andy MadleyAttendance:52,240Match StatsHome TeamNewcastleAway TeamWolvesPossessionHome42%Away58%ShotsHome19Away7Shots on TargetHome8Away4CornersHome10Away3FoulsHome11Away10Live Text Post updateMatch ends, Newcastle United 2, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1.90\\'+6\\'Full TimeSecond Half ends, Newcastle United 2, Wolverhampton Wanderers 1.90\\'+5\\'Post updateCorner,  Wolverhampton Wanderers.

We lost against a very good team.\"Despite going into the game as the Premier League\\'s lowest scorers, Wolves created a number of decent opportunities, with Daniel Podence hitting the post with a fizzing low drive shortly before the interval, while Pedro Neto and Joao Moutinho drew smart stops from Pope before Hwang\\'s equaliser.But the defeat, combined with results elsewhere over the weekend, has allowed a number of teams below Wolves to close the gap in what becoming an unpredictable relegation battle, with just five points separating the bottom nine.That makes Wolves\\' next two matches, against fellow strugglers Leeds and Nottingham Forest, hugely significant as they look to secure a fifth successive season in the top flight.'"

       " 'text': ['Casemiro has picked up two red cards for Manchester United this seasonManchester United manager Erik ten Hag has defended Casemiro after a Premier League red card against bottom club Southampton that leaves the midfielder facing a four-match ban. Casemiro was dismissed after 34 minutes of the 0-0 draw for a tackle on Carlos Alcaraz, but Ten Hag has not ruled out an appeal.The midfielder\\'s sending off followed a VAR review, with referee Anthony Taylor overturning his initial decision to show a yellow card for a tackle that hit the top of the ball first before going into Southampton forward Alcaraz\\'s leg.As Casemiro was also dismissed against Crystal Palace last month, an additional game will be added to an automatic three-match ban, meaning he won\\'t be able to play a domestic match again until the trip to Nottingham Forest on 15 April.\"When you freeze anything it looks bad - but everyone who knows something about top football knows what is bad and what is fair,\" said Ten Hag. \"And Casemiro is a really fair player. Tough but fair.\"It shows, he had played over 500 games in big leagues and never been sent off. Now it has happened twice.\"Ten Hag complained about the lack of consistency in the use of VAR, noting the referee was not sent to the monitor to review controversial incidents in Saturday\\'s game between Leicester and Chelsea. Despite having a man advantage for almost an hour and managing 17 shots, Southampton were unable to capitalise and remain bottom of the Premier League. Even before Casemiro\\'s early exit, David de Gea needed to make a brilliant reaction save to turn away Theo Walcott\\'s close-range header.De Gea then produced a one-handed save after the break when Walcott ran clear of the home defence, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line when Scott McTominay turned a Kyle Walker-Peters cross towards his own goal. In addition, James Ward-Prowse\\'s free-kick skimmed of the top of the bar and Walker-Peters also hit a post with an angled drive.United had some dangerous moments themselves, with captain Bruno Fernandes\\' goalbound effort tipped on to the inside of a post by Gavin Bazunu.The result consolidated United\\'s top-four position, whilst Southampton are effectively three points from safety given their goal difference, with 12 games of the campaign remaining.Go straight to all the best Manchester United contentVisit our Southampton pageSouthampton show improvementDespite their position in the table, Southampton\\'s form is good.They have now picked up seven points from four games since Nathan Jones was sacked on 12 February.It represents their most productive run since August and Wednesday\\'s rearranged game with Brentford does offer the opportunity for Ruben Selles\\' side to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time since the end of October.Nevertheless, their goalscoring is a concern - in only one league match since August have they scored more than once. They had the chances to improve that statistic at Old Trafford but couldn\\'t make them count.Casemiro\\'s ill disciplineCasemiro has been one of the key reasons behind United\\'s improvement this season.But the positivity around the Brazilian is in danger of being undermined by his disciplinary record.Sent off against Crystal Palace last month for grabbing Will Hughes round the neck following a mass confrontation, his latest red card was also triggered by the intervention of VAR.Casemiro did play the top of the ball first but Taylor decided the tackle was dangerous.Ten Hag said Casemiro was emotional in the dressing room afterwards. \"He is disappointed,\" Ten Hag said.Unless United manage a successful appeal, the four-match suspension would rule him out of next week\\'s FA Cup quarter-final with Fulham, plus the three Premier League games that follow.',\n",

However, there was no let off the third time.Lauren James played a pinpoint ball over the top from the right touchline, Kerr timed her run to perfection, brought the ball down on her chest, then lifted it gloriously over Earps and into the far corner.Follow live updates of Sunday\\'s WSL actionMarc Skinner\\'s side had an opportunity to equalise almost immediately when a Chelsea slip allowed Ella Toone space in the box. But the England attacking midfielder seemed torn between going for goal and crossing, and the result was neither one nor the other as the ball sailed wide.United felt they should have had a penalty in the 33rd minute when Nikita Parris went down under contact from Kadeisha Buchanan, but referee Cheryl Foster waved played on.Kerr remained Chelsea\\'s main threat in the second half, muscling Maya le Tissier off the ball before side-footing just wide. And while United pushed for a leveller in the closing stages, they failed to create any clear chances and the hosts held on.\"We deserved it - that was a Chelsea performance,\" Hayes said.\"Depleted - we have a sickness bug in the camp - we couldn\\'t play Erin Cuthbert carrying a knock and Jelena Cankovic is carrying a knock too. \"What a tremendous squad I have and I\\'ve been saying it every week that it was time for other players to step up.\"It\\'s just a massive three points and when we came into the game, we had played two games more than Manchester United since they last kicked-off.\"They played Leicester earlier last weekend, so to win like that and against a team who are top of the league is amazing for my team - fantastic effort.\"Chelsea are now two points clear at the top as they bid for a sixth WSL title.Kerr quality helps Chelsea overcome injury problems\\'One of the goals of the season\\' - Kerr hits superb openerThe depth of talent available to Chelsea is no secret but with Fran Kirby, Guro Reiten, Pernille Harder, Katerina Svitkova and Erin Cuthbert all unavailable, they needed every last bit of it against United.Even in a team of stars, Kerr has often shone brightest and - like so many great players - has a knack of delivering when it matters most.In a game of few chances, Kerr was a threat throughout with her very presence seeming to unnerve a United backline that had been breached just eight times in the WSL this campaign.\"Listen, she should have had a hat-trick,\" Hayes added. \"To be fair, I\\'ll say that because that\\'s how good she is. \"We set up really well to get her into good goalscoring positions - and let\\'s talk about the work she does for the team defensively because everybody had to put a shift in.\"An early ball over the top was not fully dealt with by the away team and Kerr was able to steal in and bring a save from Earps.After 12 minutes, Melanie Leupolz slid the ball through to Kerr and after holding off Le Tissier, saw her left-footed shot saved by the legs of Earps.There was nothing the England keeper could do when Kerr next went through, though. The pass from James was exquisite, the first touch from the striker was excellent but the angle wasn\\'t easy and Le Tissier was on her shoulder.Kerr made the lobbed finish look simple. A moment of genius that deserved to win such a mammoth top-of-the-table clash.A week after losing the League Cup final, Chelsea have taken a big stride towards a fifth WSL crown in six years.United lack cutting edge as title bid faltersAfter finishing fourth last season, that United are even in a title race shows the progress they have made.At the home of the defending champions, they controlled possession for long spells of the game and, for all that Kerr tormented the defence, they still managed to limit Chelsea\\'s opportunities.But at no stage did they really look like unlocking a stubborn home defence.\"We knew we are going to be without the ball for large periods and everyone was disciplined in their roles which they carried out the gameplan to perfection, \" Chelsea boss Hayes said.Toone had the chance to create something just after the goal but she and Alessia Russo were largely kept quiet by Chelsea.The non-penalty award after Parris appeared to be tripped by Buchanan will rankle but given the lofty ambitions for this side, Skinner will also be frustrated by the failure to trouble an under-strength Chelsea more.Millie Turner\\'s back-post header and a sliced effort from Leah Galton were as close as they came with Chelsea able to keep them at arm\\'s length.The title race still has a way to go but with Chelsea in a position to stretch their lead to five points by winning their game in hand, there is no more margin for error and United cannot afford another off day from an attack that has been so prolific for much of the season.',\n",

We were too slow in moving and passing, we were sloppy and we didn\\'t look focused.\"We were not able to get the intensity and energy on the grass and this is why we deserved to be 1-0 down.\"The second half was better, without creating enough clear-cut chances.

Celtic\\'s answer was emphatic and a measure of the progress and continuous development the manager extracts from this squad.Yes, Celtic were assisted by Charles Dunne\\'s momentary lapse in concentration and red card that ripped St Mirren\\'s effective game plan apart.However, that word squad is key. Celtic put five by 10-man St MirrenGet all of your Celtic news in one place on the BBCReaction & as it happenedPre-match, Postecoglou emphasised his view there is too much focus on starting line ups.Celtic started with the same 11 who took to the field in the Viaplay Cup final. Postecoglou introduced exactly the same players from the bench. Their impact was telling as the game flipped from 1-0 down to 5-1 up.\"We always know in these kind of games, whether it\\'s 10 or 11 men, we\\'ll overrun the opposition,\" the Australian explained.\"Again, a really good impact from the guys coming on, I thought they were outstanding.\"It doesn\\'t matter what the opposition are doing and what the context of the game is.\"That\\'s 250 goals under Postecoglou in just under 100 competitive matches. It equates to an average of almost exactly 2.5 goals a game. That relentlessness is reaping consistent and emphatic reward.There were five different scorers in Paisley, including from two new recruits in the form of Alistair Johnston and Oh Hyeon-gyu . But this is nothing new.This season Celtic have had 19 different scorers in the Premiership, the highest number of any club. That\\'s four above title rivals Rangers, and 10 more than Kilmarnock at the bottom of the pack.\"It would\\'ve been very easy say at 3-1, for us to just cruise through the rest of the game but it\\'s not who we are,\" said the Celtic manager. \"We\\'re going right to the final whistle.\"\\'It\\'s like a healthy anxiety\\'Going back even further, since the Australian\\'s arrival in Scotland, the league stats simply don\\'t lie.

Of course it is tight and we have to keep working well and working hard.\"Palace stayed 12th, five points above the drop zone while relegation rivals Leeds remain 17th, after losing 1-0 away to out-of-form Chelsea.\"Now we are thinking about the next game with all the confidence we can and with the support of our fans,\" Leeds boss Javi Gracia told BBC MOTD after his side\\'s 13th league defeat of the season.\"We know we are able to get points.\"Who will be relegated?Predict who will be the Premier League\\'s bottom three this seasonFirst1Second2Third3Confirm selectionOur coverage of your Premier League club is bigger and better than ever before - follow your team and sign up for notifications in the BBC Sport app to make sure you never miss a moment',\n",
       "  'Kylian Mbappe has scored 201 goals in 247 games for Paris St-Germain since joining in 2017Kylian Mbappe scored a club record 201st goal for Paris St-Germain in an entertaining 4-2 win over Nantes.He had to wait until the 92nd minute but was clinical as he turned to finish left-footed and go clear of Edinson Cavani at the top of the PSG goal list.The France forward, who turned 24 in December, has established himself as a footballing superstar.\"I play to make history,\" said Mbappe, who joined in 2017 initially on loan from Monaco before a 180m euros move.\"I have always said I wanted to make history in France, in the capital of my country, in my city, and I am doing that. It\\'s magnificent, but there is still a lot to be done.\"Mbappe finished the game as captain and told Canal Plus: \"For me, as a native Parisian, this is special. If someone had said to me I would score the goal to beat the record while wearing the captain\\'s armband, I would not have believed it.\"The Frenchman has played at two World Cup finals, winning the trophy in 2018 and earning the Golden Boot as top scorer in 2022.Mbappe, who also won the 2021 Nations League with his country, scored a hat-trick in December\\'s World Cup final against Argentina, which France lost on penalties after a 3-3 draw.Since joining PSG from Monaco in 2017 for a world-record fee for a teenager, Mbappe has won four Ligue 1 titles and topped the division\\'s scoring charts for each of the past four seasons.This season, the forward has now scored 30 goals and made eight assists - taking his total to 85 for the club in 247 games.PSG went 2-0 up at the Parc des Princes with Lionel Messi opening the scoring before Jaouen Hadjam\\'s own goal.However, Nantes came back to level before half-time thanks to goals from Ludovic Blas and Ignatius Ganago, with PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma caught out at his near post for the first and making a fumble that led to the second.Mbappe crossed for Danilo Pereira to head the home side back in front on the hour mark before his crowning moment came late in the game.',\n",
       "  \"Matthijs de Ligt opened the scoring for Bayern Munich at the Mercedes-Benz ArenaBayern Munich returned to the top of the Bundesliga with victory at Stuttgart.Matthjis de Ligt opened the scoring with a low strike from distance in the 39th minute before Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting doubled the lead in the 62nd.Choupo-Moting's goal - set up by good work from Jamal Musiala and Thomas Muller - came the day after he signed a new one-year contract at Bayern.Stuttgart pulled a goal back through Juan Jose Perea with two minutes to go.German Bundesliga tableVictory sends Julian Nagelsmann's side back to the top of the Bundesliga standings, ahead of Borussia Dortmund on goal difference.Dortmund had overtaken Bayern and gone three points clear at the summit with a 2-1 win over RB Leipzig on Friday.\"],\n",
