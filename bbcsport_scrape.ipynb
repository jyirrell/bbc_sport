I was saying I might have to bring a blindfold. It\\'s always the fear - if a Premier League team turns up, they can blow any League Two side away.\"The Mariners only returned to the EFL after finishing sixth in the National League last season, and needing extra time in all three play-off games - edging past Notts County and Wrexham before overcoming Solihull Moors in the final.ITV summariser Ally McCoist admitted he \"didn\\'t give Grimsby a chance\" before kick-off.\"I couldn\\'t see a way they would get a result,\" he said. \"It\\'s magic.\"\"We need to talk about Southampton another day because they have been shocking. It\\'s all about Grimsby. What a night for those 4,000 fans.\"It\\'s one of the greatest nights in their history.\"A monumental night for the Mariners - Grimsby stun Saints\\'Eighteen months in dreamland\\'Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Alex Green of the DN35 Grimsby Town podcast said he backed his team to pull off an upset against the Premier League strugglers after seeing off higher-ranking opposition in each of the previous rounds.Town overcame League One trio Plymouth Argyle, Cambridge United and Burton Albion in rounds one, two and three before thumping Championship side Luton in a fourth-round replay last month.\"We played Luton and I preferred to play Southampton,\" he said. \"The performance was incredible.\"We\\'re a very underrated knockout football club - so many teams have found that out. Compare our resources to someone like Wrexham - they massively outstrip us. It\\'s been 18 months in dreamland.\"Manager Hurst is now in his second spell in charge at Blundell Park, having previously managed them alongside Rob Scott from 2011 to 2013.He was reappointed in December 2020 following the departure of Ian Holloway but was unable to prevent the club from slipping back into the National League for the first time in five years.\"Some managers just click at clubs, and he does that at this club,\" Green continued.\"The problem now is, we go from some fans disgruntled that we are 16th to being worried Hurst might go elsewhere.\"The love he has at this club is sensational.\"Hurst\\'s Grimsby are only the sixth team from the fourth tier or below to reach the quarter-finals since the introduction of the Fourth Division of the Football League in 1958-59, and only the second since 1989-90.It is also the first time they have beaten top-flight opposition as a fourth-tier side in the FA Cup since January 1989, when they defeated Middlesbrough in the third round.Was it a mistake to sell off British Gas?

His skills are really high - for a centre-back he has so many skills and he has to use that.\"Maguire, who turns 30 on Sunday, 5 March, has only started five Premier League games this season, despite being a regular in England\\'s team at both Euro 2020 and last winter\\'s World Cup.Former United captain Roy Keane, speaking on ITV, felt Maguire has to have a strong end to the season to save his Old Trafford career.\"It was a big night for Harry, any mistake he makes will be highlighted,\" added Keane. \"He is playing for his future at the moment as he has a big summer coming up.\"I have been very hard on him in the past because of the mistakes he makes, but he is a good character.\"England defender Harry Maguire captained Manchester United in their FA Cup victory over West HamEx-Chelsea and England attacker Joe Cole, also speaking on ITV, added: \"There are no worries about his personality.\"Remember the pressure of the World Cup?

We showed we have the character to deal with difficult situations, the team can keep going with energy.\"It\\'s not about 11 players, the bench can have an impact.FA Cup 2023: \\'Massive performance\\' from Man Utd\"They believe they can win games and once again they did it and I\\'m happy with that process. This team does not show panic and can change the dynamic of the game.\"On Argentine teenager Garnacho, who scored United\\'s second goal in the 90th minute, Ten Hag said: \"It was another step for him. I said before the game you have to have an impact as a starter and I think he is capable of that.\"It\\'s a great skill when you\\'re fearless and brave.

       "  \"Lauren Davidson scored twice for Glasgow City in their win over MotherwellGlasgow City maintained their three-point lead at the SWPL summit after a comfortable win over Motherwell.Two goals in eight first-half minutes from Emily Whelan and Lauren Davidson put the hosts, who remain unbeaten in the league this season, two up before Davidson added her second and City's third after the break.Celtic ensured they remain just three points off the top with a seven-goal thrashing of Hamilton Academical, while Rangers inflicted a 5-0 defeat on Partick Thistle.Fran Alonso's side raced into a 3-0 first-half lead thanks to goals from Natasha Flint, Natalie Ross and Shen Menglu. After the interval, Flint added a fourth from the spot before Shen Mengyu, Maria McAneny and Olivia Chance completed the rout.As for Malky Mackay's Rangers, who are four points off Celtic, it was Emma Watson's goal that was the difference at Broadwood in the first period. But the home side sealed the win with a second-half goal flurry after a Jodi McLeary finish and Jenny Danielsson brace was followed by a header from Kayla McCoy.Elsewhere, Hearts stay fourth after Ciara Grant's spot kick and Emma Brownlie's deft finish earned a deserved victory away to Dundee United.There was also a win for Spartans, who inflicted a 20th straight loss on bottom-of-the-table Glasgow Women thanks to goals from Caley Gibb and Becky Galbraith, while Hibernian and Aberdeen played out a goalless stalemate.\",\n",
       "  \"Arsenal 4-0 Everton: Mikel Arteta 'delighted' with victory over EvertonArsenal's home defeat by Premier League champions and title rivals Manchester City that knocked them off the top of the table carried all the hallmarks of a defining moment in their season. If it was, the Gunners' response since then has been truly outstanding and the 4-0 thrashing of hopeless Everton at Emirates Stadium delivered thrilling confirmation that Arsenal are in this title race to stay.Arsenal's third successive win since the 3-1 defeat by City gives clarity to the task in front of them as they are now five points clear with 13 games remaining, the same as Manchester City. Mikel Arteta's side had been passing tests all season, showing a new steel and resilience to answer lingering questions about their character, but the loss to City at Emirates Stadium on 15 February felt different. Arsenal had been at full tilt to hit top spot while City had been muddling along well short of their best - yet Pep Guardiola's men raised their game to put the Gunners away and deliver what felt like a hefty psychological blow.How would Arsenal respond? How would Arteta respond? Would the Gunners crumble or could they gather themselves again in the face of such a desperate disappointment? In other words, would they hold their nerve? Latest Arsenal news, analysis and fan viewsGet Gunners news notificationsListen to the latest The Far Post podcastPlenty of observers, including this one, wondered if this would be the day Arsenal might crack under the pressure exerted by City, who have been successful over this course and distance so many times.The answers have been provided emphatically after three potentially tough tests away to Aston Villa and Leicester City as well as at home Everton. Villa were beaten because Arsenal simply refused to accept one point, sealing three in added time for a 4-2 win. The Foxes were overcome with the efficiency of Arsenal sides of old with a 1-0 victory. Everton were dismantled 4-0 with the fluency that has marked out their splendid season. Three games. Three wins. Arsenal's position of authority at the Premier League summit restored. Arsenal have 60 points from 25 Premier League games. When they finished fifth last season, they managed 69 points from 38 gamesArsenal were under scrutiny for any signs of weakness after they were beaten by Manchester City.  None has been evident. The Gunners have shown the mentality and ability to take blows - indeed, remember they also lost to the Everton side beaten so easily on Wednesday - that champions are made of. They may not end the season on top as there will be twists and turns to come, but make no mistake this thrilling Arsenal side is only heading in one direction under Arteta. Arsenal had to play a game of patience against Sean Dyche's side, who provided obstinate opposition for the first 40 minutes and were helped by the fact Everton are abject when they get into any position of danger. The big moment came when Oleksandr Zinchenko and Bukayo Saka unlocked the door shortly before half-time. After that, Arsenal burst through it. Saka caught Idrissa Gueye dozing to set up Gabriel Martinelli for the second on the stroke of the break and that was game over because Everton have not scored more than one goal in 15 games, stretching back to the 3-0 win against Crystal Palace on 22 October. Bukayo Saka has scored 27 goals and provided 24 assists in 122 Premier League appearancesMartin Odegaard and Martinelli added the flourishes in the second half, while Arsenal wasted other opportunities to make this a thoroughly humiliating night for Everton, who could have lost by even more. There was further good news for Arsenal when Thomas Partey came on for the second half to exert his influence in midfield, while the strength of Arteta's squad was emphasised by the introduction of Kieran Tierney, Emile Smith Rowe, Eddie Nketiah and Fabio Vieira as substitutes. The sight of Gabriel Jesus back on the grass this week after knee surgery only increases the feel-good factor swirling around the club. Arteta's delight at the final whistle was understandable. His side have found Everton, and Dyche in his Burnley guise, a difficult proposition in recent times. Here, once they had the lead, they were ruthless. The Gunners could have felt sorry for themselves after the loss to Manchester City. Instead, they have reacted in the manner that says they are not going away. Big games, big results - and the Premier League title race is in Arsenal's hands once more.

I shall continue to concentrate on my football.\"The alleged breaches took place between 25 February 2017 and 23 January 2021, during which time Toney represented Scunthorpe United, Wigan Athletic, Peterborough United and Brentford.The forward has scored 14 goals in 21 Premier League games this season, helping Brentford to ninth in the table and in contention for European qualification.The FA has declined to comment.Our coverage of Brentford is bigger and better than ever before - here\\'s everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything Brentford - go straight to all the best content',\n",

       "  'No regrets starting Kane on bench - StelliniTottenham assistant coach Cristian Stellini says there are no regrets about starting Harry Kane on the bench in Wednesday\\'s surprise FA Cup fifth-round defeat by Championship side Sheffield United.Spurs made six changes for the game at Bramall Lane, with Son Heung-min, Richarlison and Lucas Moura in attack as Kane - the club\\'s all-time top scorer - was named among the substitutes.The Premier League side went into the fixture on the back of a 2-0 win against Chelsea that strengthened their top-four hopes, but produced a lethargic display before Iliman Ndiaye produced a moment of magic for the Blades with a clinical near-post finish to secure the 1-0 win late on.Defeat leaves Tottenham with the Champions League as their only hope of ending a 15-year trophy drought this season.FA Cup 2023 highlights: Sheffield United 1-0 TottenhamStellini, standing in for Antonio Conte as the Italian continues to recuperate following gallbladder surgery, stood by the decision not to play Kane from the start against the Blades.\"It is not a regret,\" he said. \"We need to look in the medium period, we have many games. \"Harry Kane played in the last six games, one time with fever, one time with a problem. We have to take care of our best player. \"It\\'s not about Harry because we played with Richarlison, Lucas Moura and Sonny. I think it is good enough to play in this competition and against this sort of team.\"Addressing the thousands of supporters who travelled to Sheffield, Stellini added: \"I think we missed a big opportunity and we have to apologise to the fans.\"There were 5,000 of them here to watch our performance and we apologise because we missed a big opportunity.\"Chance of silverware gone?Tottenham switch focus back to the Premier League with a trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday before they host AC Milan in the Champions League last 16 next Wednesday looking to overturn a 1-0 defeat in the first leg.Spurs fans will certainly hope for a much-improved display in these games after their lethargic performance against Sheffield United, where they struggled to create big opportunities.\"It\\'s not about motivation,\" said Stellini, when asked about Spurs\\' performance against the Blades.\"I don\\'t think it\\'s about motivation. It\\'s about maybe if you don\\'t play consistently, maybe sometimes you try to manage the energy to arrive at the end of the game. Or you drop the energy from the start because you think the game is easy. \"Our games are never easy. We need to be more consistent - this is about mentality.\"Former Premier League striker Clinton Morrison, who was watching Tottenham\\'s game for BBC Radio 5 Live, believes Spurs have blown a big opportunity to win a trophy this season.\"Tottenham have got no chance of the Champions League - they need to concentrate on the top four,\" he said.\"They might beat Milan, but this is a massive opportunity missed tonight.\"Latest Tottenham news, analysis and fan viewsGet Spurs news notificationsListen to the latest The Far Post podcastOur coverage of Tottenham Hotspur is bigger and better than ever before - here\\'s everything you need to know to make sure you never miss a momentEverything Spurs - go straight to all the best content',\n",

       "  'Support from Spike driving Ferguson to Cup glory with WeldersIrish Cup quarter-final: H&W Welders v LarneVenue: Blanchflower Stadium, Belfast Date: Friday, 3 March Kick-off: 19:45 GMTCoverage: Live stream on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website with text commentary and in-play clips on the BBC Sport websiteHis manager has described it as the biggest match in the club\\'s history, but H&W Welders striker Matthew Ferguson is allowing himself to look even further ahead. Mind you, given he is the son of one of the greatest strikers ever to grace the Irish League, it is perhaps not that surprising that he is dreaming big - even if he is the first to admit the enormity of the immediate task at hand.That task for the Championship club is, no less, an Irish Cup quarter-final at home to Irish Premiership table-toppers Larne on Friday night. Not quite David v Goliath - the name of one of the Harland & Wolff cranes, ironically - but few will give the east Belfast outfit much of a chance.However, Ferguson grew up watching dad Glenn win five Irish Cups with Linfield and Glenavon, and was letting his mind drift to this season\\'s showpiece occasion.\"Well, you always dream about those big days,\" he said as he looked ahead to a match that will be streamed live on the BBC Sport website and iPlayer.\"We still have a good bit to go to get to the cup final stage but, again, these are the games that you will remember, and especially if you win them. It is great to have an opportunity like Friday night to go and put your own stamp on it, and, who knows, it will hopefully be a great victory for the club.\"Asked what it would mean to progress to the semi-finals, the 27-year-old added: \"It would be absolutely massive. \"To go one further to a semi-final would be absolutely fantastic, and you are pretty much one game away from a sunny day in May. When it gets to the cup final, anything can happen. \"We don\\'t want to look too far but then European [football] starts to come into it as well but we just need to take each game as it comes. We\\'ll look forward to Friday night and see what we can do.\"   \\'It was a hard, hard place\\'Glenn Ferguson will be in the crowd to watch son Matthew on Friday nightThe excitement Ferguson is feeling ahead of Friday night\\'s cup tie is in stark contrast to the emotions he had to endure for two years from the summer of 2020.A dislocated kneecap in a pre-season friendly meant he was on the sidelines for a year, only to dislocate it again, forcing him to be out of football for a further 12 months. He found the mental challenge of his injury turmoil difficult, but it was the thought of glamour occasions like Friday at their revamped Blanchflower Stadium that kept him going.\"It was a hard, hard place to be at the time,\" he recalled.\"I just had to keep the head strong and keep working hard. I\\'m back playing football, I\\'m loving every second of it, and now there is a massive opportunity on Friday night. These are the occasions that you hang in there for and I\\'m really looking forward to it.\"  And he could not be going into the game in better form, having hit 17 goals this season. They have all come in the league, though, so he feels he is due one in the cup.\"Yes, hopefully I have left it for the big occasion. Listen, no matter who scores, as long as H&W Welders get the win, that is what is most important. I\\'m in decent form but I would like to bring it into Friday night and get a goal for myself.\"\\'Team\\'s togetherness will be vital\\' Welders boss Paul Kee celebrates beating GlenavonThe Welders as a team are in fine form, currently fifth in the Championship table, with Ferguson feeling they have turned their season around since experienced Irish League campaigner Paul Kee took over as manager in October.They have already knocked out two top-flight sides - Newry City and then Glenavon - to make it to the last eight and Ferguson believes the togetherness instilled at the club by Kee will be a major factor if they are to beat Larne.\"The club is together right through, from fans to volunteers, supporters, people behind the scenes and the coaching staff - everybody is absolutely together,\" he said.\"That is probably a big part of our success over the last lot of weeks. Heads were down, we were bottom of the league at one stage but we have put a great run together in the league and now we have put a good cup run together too.\" And while Kee\\'s pre-match message will no doubt be the last one Ferguson hears before going out on to the pitch, what advice does his dad have for him ahead of these big games?\"One of the big things he says to me is \\'Matthew play the game, not the occasion\\'. Just to go and play a game of football. He will be here supporting me along with the rest of the family.\"Will it be the last Irish Cup match he watches his son play this season? Ferguson Jnr hopes not.',\n",

He was snapped up by Portuguese club Vitoria Guimaraes on a four-year contract later that year, scoring his first goal for them in a 3-2 Europa League group-stage victory against the Gunners in October.After registering 19 goals in 96 appearances for Vitoria, Edwards joined Primeira Liga rivals Sporting in January 2022. He produced eye-catching displays against former employers Spurs in the Champions League this season, impressing in Sporting\\'s 2-0 victory over Antonio Conte\\'s team before netting the opener in a 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Ross Sykes (Union Saint-Gilloise)Former Accrington Stanley defender Ross Sykes has already played against Union Berlin this seasonBorn in Burnley, Ross Sykes played for the Clarets between the ages of 11 and 13 before being released for being too small. He was on the brink of giving up football, but his mother persuaded him to trial at Accrington Stanley - who offered him his first professional contract in May 2016.After a brief loan spell with National League North side Southport, Sykes made his full league debut against Gillingham on the opening day of the 2018-19 campaign. He made 131 appearances for Stanley across all competitions before being signed by Belgium\\'s Union Saint-Gilloise in June.The 6ft 6ins centre-back started both legs of Union\\'s Champions League third-round play-off defeat by Rangers, before playing the whole 90 minutes in a 1-0 Europa League group-stage defeat by Bundesliga title contenders Union Berlin.

He played with the likes of Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala and Brighton loanee Levi Colwill during his time with the Blues, but after rejecting a scholarship deal in 2020 he joined the Serie A club on a three-year deal in September that year.Part of Juventus\\' under-19s team that reached the 2021-22 Uefa Youth League semi-finals, the winger made his Serie A debut in a 4-0 win over Empoli before being given his Champions League bow in a thrilling 4-3 defeat at Benfica. Four days later, he set up the only goal 41 seconds after coming off the bench as Massimiliano Allegri\\'s team won 1-0 at Lecce 1-0.In December, he was rewarded for those eye-catching cameos with a new contract until 2025.Tammy Abraham (Roma)Tammy Abraham scored 17 Serie A goals last season - more than any other English player in a single campaign in Italy\\'s top flightAfter joining Chelsea aged seven, Abraham went on to score 30 goals in 82 appearances for the Blues before joining Roma in the aftermath of Romelu Lukaku\\'s return to Stamford Bridge in August 2021. He finished an outstanding debut campaign with two goals in a 3-0 win at Torino in May, making him the highest-scoring English player in a Serie A campaign with 17. He also scored nine Europa Conference League goals as the Giallorossi won the competition - beating Feyenoord in the final.Abraham has so far failed to hit the heights of the previous campaign, scoring just seven times in 33 appearances across all competitions this season. His last goal for the club came in a 2-0 win over Empoli at the beginning of February.Chris Smalling (Roma)Chris Smalling has missed just two games for Roma this season across all competitionsChris Smalling has become an integral part of Mourinho\\'s Roma side since joining from Manchester United in 2019, making more than 120 appearances for them.
