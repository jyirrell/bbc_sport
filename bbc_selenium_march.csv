1,Aston Villa 3-0 Bournemouth: Unai Emery's side claim third win in four games,SAT 18 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Jacob Ramsey scored Aston Villa's second as they saw off Bournemouth at Villa ParkUnai Emery says his Aston Villa side have to show ""big ambition"" and push for a European place after they cruised past struggling Bournemouth at Villa Park.Douglas Luiz was picked out by Leon Bailey and swept home from close range early on, before Jacob Ramsey jinked past Jack Stephens to make sure of three points.Villa added a third when Emi Buendia headed in from a yard out after Tyrone Mings flicked on Luiz's corner to seal the hosts' third win in four Premier League games.Villa stay 11th but move to within four points of sixth, while Bournemouth remain in the bottom three after being brought back down to earth following their win over Liverpool last weekend.Relive Aston Villa v Bournemouth and all of Saturday's Premier League actionHow did you rate Aston Villa's performance? Have your say hereWhat did you make of Bournemouth's display? Send us your views here""After the matches we lost to Arsenal and Leicester, the reaction has been fantastic. Today is maybe the best 90 minutes we played here since I arrived,"" Emery told BBC Match of the Day.""We controlled the game with the ball. We conceded some chances to them, but I think it is normal because they are in a good moment. I'm happy today and I want to share it with the players and supporters.""We have to rest a little bit but now we have a big challenge because we are slowly going up. We are looking up. It's important to have big ambitions and face big challenges. We have Chelsea in two weeks and we have to try and be consistent.""Next step is top 10, but if we are ambitious you want to get to something more and look at the teams in the European positions. Of course it is not in our hands to take a European place, but we have to try. We have to take this new challenge.""Villa were on top from the start and, after Luiz put them in front, they had numerous chances to extend the lead.Ollie Watkins had the best of the opportunities when he was put through by Buendia, only for his dinked effort to be kept out by Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto.The hosts might also have had a penalty six minutes before the break when Ramsey's goalbound shot was deflected over the bar by the hand of Stephens, but the video assistant referee turned down Villa's appeals.Bournemouth's limited threat came through the pace of their front three. However, Dominic Solanke, now without a goal in 10 league matches, lacked conviction when clean through and his hesitation allowed Mings to get back and make the block.Defeat left Gary O'Neil's side a point from safety, but there was a major highlight as David Brooks came on to make his first appearance since being diagnosed with cancer in 2021 - 534 days since his last game.Villa continue to make progress under EmeryUnai Emery hails 'best' Villa home display of seasonWhen Emery took charge in October, Villa were below Bournemouth in the table. Victory on Saturday means they are now 14 points ahead of them and they looked the superior side throughout.Even before going in front, Villa looked to have the measure of Bournemouth, with Buendia, flanked by Ramsey and Bailey, finding space between midfield and defence and looking to feed Watkins.After the goal, VIlla eased off and allowed Bournemouth back into it, but a couple of scares midway through the half shook them out of their slumber and by the break they were in the ascendancy once more.Chances were more scarce early in the second period, but Villa always maintained control of the game as Luiz and John McGinn patrolled the middle of the park, and the hosts always looked the more likely to find the game's second goal.Ramsey eventually provided it and Villa were able to express themselves for the final 10 minutes, creating chances at will as Watkins came close again and Mings spurned a glorious chance, shooting straight at Neto from seven yards out having been left all alone at the far post.With 11 games to go and only four points separating sixth and 11th in the table, Villa have the chance to make it an exciting end to the season and push for an unlikely European spot.Blunt Bournemouth struggle again on road'We gave Villa a head start', says Cherries boss Gary O'NeilAfter the high of toppling Liverpool a week ago, it was back to reality for Bournemouth as they succumbed to a ninth defeat in 10 away games in all competitions.The manner in which Villa were able to cut through them will be a concern for O'Neil and the Cherries have now kept only one clean sheet in 24 league away games.Bournemouth's best spell came after the opening goal as they managed to get players close to Buendia and frustrate the Villa creator.However, Villa adjusted, Bournemouth did not and the Argentine was soon collecting the ball in vast areas of space again - and if it was not him, then it was Bailey, Ramsey or left-back Alex Moreno exposing the gaps.Just as concerning was the lack of threat at the other end. Against Liverpool and Arsenal, Bournemouth were always dangerous on the break.They were again here but, with Villa also at their best on the counter, such chances were harder to come by, especially after going behind so early.Tasked with trying to break down a set Villa backline, Bournemouth rarely troubled Emi Martinez in the home goal as they suffered another disappointing day on the road.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64923720

Leicester are one of just three sides across Europe's top five leagues not to have kept a clean sheet since club football resumed after last winter's World Cup.Goalkeeper Daniel Iversen made his Premier League debut, replacing regular number one Danny Ward, but was unable to keep out Jensen's strike which deflected off both Ricardo Pereira and Dewsbury-Hall.Brentford fail to finish Foxes off in first halfBrentford 'can do more' - Thomas FrankBrentford should have had the game won in the first half.They deservedly went ahead through Jensen's fourth goal in his last five home games for the Bees.Earlier, Bryan Mbeumo had seen his close-range header fly just wide and both the winger and fellow forward Ivan Toney, recently called up to the England squad, had a flurry of efforts blocked.In the second half, Thomas Frank's side struggled to break down their opponents and it was Leicester who looked the likelier to find a winner.Midfielder Shandon Baptiste came on in the 75th minute but had a late cameo to forget, collecting two yellow cards in three minutes as Brentford were made to play the last five minutes of injury time with 10 men.Brentford's next game after the international break is against Brighton on Saturday 1 April, while Leicester City play Crystal Palace on the same day.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64923721

There was no intent from the Spaniard, but Salisbury wasted little time in brandishing the red card after being told to review the tackle on his monitor.Unused substitute Matheus Nunes was also shown a red card deep into second-half stoppage time after remonstrating with the officials in the aftermath of Rodrigo's late goal.After conceding four for the first time since October, Wolves' meeting with Nottingham Forest after the international break now takes on added importance.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64923722

Everton's improved resilience under Dyche was on show again and 22-year-old local product Simms was the hero with a superb late equaliser to wreck Chelsea's hopes of a fourth consecutive win. Chelsea broke down Everton's resistance seven minutes after the break when the excellent Joao Felix drilled home a low drive, but they were pegged back when Abdoulaye Doucoure scrambled home an equaliser from a corner after 69 minutes. Everton were only on level terms for seven minutes until Kai Havertz scored from the spot after Reece James was fouled by James Tarkowski - but there was to be a late twist in the tale.

He told me four things and I said 'you're right' - one of them was playing stronger and he did that today.""Simms, who has had loan spells at Blackpool, Hearts and most recently Sunderland, was recalled to Goodison Park in January as then-manager Frank Lampard sought to bolster his attacking options.He made just one Everton appearance prior to this season but has featured in six games since returning to his boyhood club - including four under Dyche.Simms told Sky Sports: ""It's about patience - I just had to wait for my chance.

They kept Chelsea at arm's length until the second half then reacted superbly to going behind twice, especially when they gathered themselves again when all looked lost after Havertz's penalty. Everton were strong in defence throughout, prepared to throw bodies on the line, and showed their threat from set pieces once again when Doucoure headed in at the far post from a corner. The high point, however, was the manner in which youngster Simms - back at Everton after a loan spell at Sunderland - outmuscled Kalidou Koulibaly and raced on to beat Chelsea keeper Kepa with a cool finish.

Forest's opener came against the run of play when Newcastle defender Sven Botman unforgivably gifted possession to Dennis, who smartly chipped it over the players standing guard on the goalline. The visitors' pressure eventually paid off when Willock set-up Isak for a precise volley into the far corner on the stroke of half-time and the Swedish striker later delivered the winner to spark celebratory scenes in the away end in Nottingham.The result leaves Newcastle just a point behind Tottenham in fifth - and still with a game in hand - while Forest remain two points above the relegation zone.Newcastle showed 'brilliant' character - HoweNewcastle's effort pays off as Forest woes continueNewcastle were made to work hard for their victory but it was well deserved.They had already forced Forest goalkeeper Keylor Navas into action on numerous occasions in the second half as pressure grew inside the hosts' half, while defender Serge Aurier made a goalline clearance and striker Jacob Murphy volleyed wide from close range.Luck appeared to be on Forest's side when Anderson's goal was ruled out for offside in the build-up, but Newcastle were eventually rewarded for their endeavour as Isak stepped up again to deliver the goods.It was the first time this season Newcastle had come from behind to win in the Premier League and it strengthens their challenge for a Champions League qualification spot.It was also another impressive showing from Isak, who now has six goals in 10 Premier League appearances after also netting in the 2-1 win over Wolves last weekend.Travelling supporters remained packed in the stands long after the final whistle celebrating with the players on the pitch and chanting to their success in what could prove to be a significant result. For Forest it was another disappointing result.

7,Brighton & Hove Albion 1-0 Crystal Palace: Patrick Vieira calls for a change of 'mindset' from Eagles,WED 15 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Crystal Palace have not scored for 425 minutes in the Premier LeaguePatrick Vieira says his Crystal Palace side need to change their ""mindset"" to end their 11-game winless run that has dragged them towards a relegation battle.Palace have managed just four goals since the turn of the year and only fellow strugglers Everton, Wolves and Southampton have scored less than the Eagles' 21 goals this term.A third consecutive 1-0 defeat, on Wednesday against a Brighton side chasing European football, followed a frustratingly familiar pattern for Vieira with his side spurning three good chances to take control of the game in the opening 10 minutes and missing two gilt-edged chances to level.""We were aggressive enough but with a lack of talent at times, killer instinct and ruthlessness to put the ball in the net,"" said Vieira.""The problem is we don't score those goals and we don't make the right decisions in the last third. It is confidence. ""We showed the character and personality and played some really good football at times. When you look at those aspects, it's positive.""But the most important is to score and we have to keep being positive and change our mindset, especially the front players. The players need to understand those opportunities are important.""Brighton news and fan viewsGo straight to all the best Palace contentWhile Wilfried Zaha, Odsonne Edouard and Michael Olise were unable to make an early breakthrough for the Eagles, Solly March's goal proved decisive, with the winger clinically finishing into the bottom left corner from Kaoru Mitoma's incisive pass.Roberto de Zerbi's side always looked the more accomplished after that and move level on 42 points with sixth-placed Liverpool, while they are six behind Tottenham in fourth, with two games in hand.The result will only deepen concerns at Palace, who sit 12th in the table but just three points above the bottom three.However, Vieira had few complaints about the performance of goalkeeper Joe Whitworth on his Palace debut - a memorable night for the 19-year-old as he deputised for the injured Vicente Guaita. The teenager, who grew up as an Eagles supporter and was also a club ball boy, was given little chance by March's unerring finish but kept his side in the game after the break by superbly saving Pervis Estupinan's low shot and an Alexis Mac Allister header.""There was no doubt about his confidence,"" Vieira added. ""He is a confident young player who knows the club up and down. He showed he has talent.""Palace pay for profligacyVieira's last MOTD interview: Brighton 1-0 Crystal Palace - Vieira criticises Eagles' lack of killer instinctHaving pressed and pressurised Brighton into several early mistakes, the visitors could and should have been well ahead by the time March opened the scoring in the 15th minute. Zaha's wriggling run through the home defence caused Seagulls goalkeeper Jason Steele to readjust hastily to prevent an opening-minute goal for the visitors. But their was a distinct lack of conviction shown with the chances then presented to French forward Edouard - who headed wide under no pressure - and Olise's attempt that Steele saved with the winger converging on goal. Joachim Andersen's tame effort and substitute Naouirou Ahamada's late miss - dragging a shot wide with the full goal to aim at - summed up a miserable night for Palace in attack.Brighton continue their chargeBrighton 1-0 Crystal Palace: The players believe in our style, says Roberto de ZerbiWhile this was far from Brighton at their brilliant best, they still got the job done in a manner that their fans have become accustomed to - by attempting to dominate possession. A sign of the Seagulls' progress in recent weeks can be seen by the attitude in the stands, with draws at Leeds and in the reverse fixture against Palace now viewed as dropped points. And had they not had a goal incorrectly ruled out by VAR for offside at Selhurst Park last month, their European hopes would be even greater. As it was, De Zerbi was able to rest Adam Webster and Evan Ferguson for the majority of the contest and still see his side eke out a valuable three points courtesy of March, who is enjoying his best goalscoring return in a season. The 28-year-old, who also scored in last weekend's draw at Leeds, provided a useful nudge to Gareth Southgate, who names his latest England squad on Thursday.""Every English player wants to work towards playing for their national team,"" March said.""It would be an honour but I have to keep doing what I am doing and let's see what happens.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62859264

9,Fulham 0-3 Arsenal: Gunners restore five-point lead at top of table with convincing win,SUN 12 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Gabriel Martinelli scored his 12th league goal of the season in Arsenal's win at FulhamArsenal restored their five-point advantage at the top of the Premier League in outstanding fashion with a ruthless victory at Fulham. Mikel Arteta's side responded to Manchester City's narrow victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday night by wrapping up this win by half-time as they opened up a 3-0 lead with a devastating attacking display. Gabriel Martinelli had already had a goal narrowly ruled out for offside by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), before defender Gabriel headed in Leandro Trossard's corner after 21 minutes - the first of a trio of assists for the Belgian. Trossard then crossed for Martinelli to beat the static Antonee Robinson to head home at the far post five minutes later, before providing the delivery for captain Martin Odegaard's cool finish in first-half stoppage time. Fulham mounted a belated threat after the break as visiting keeper Aaron Ramsdale denied Bobby de Cordova-Reid, while Tosin Adarabioyo headed against the woodwork. Arsenal, however, were always in control and Arteta was able to re-introduce influential striker Gabriel Jesus for the first time since he required knee surgery after being injured playing for Brazil against Cameroon at the World Cup for a 13-minute cameo.Team news followed by live text coverage of Sunday's Premier League actionVisit our Fulham pageGo straight to our Arsenal contentTrossard stands out as Gunners pass another testThis had all the hallmarks of a hazardous fixture for Arsenal given Fulham's impressive campaign and the pressure on after Manchester City reduced their lead to two points.But, once again, the steel, character and skill that has characterised their season was on show. The £21m capture of Trossard from Brighton in January looks increasingly shrewd by the week and he ran riot down Fulham's right flank, taking on the role of creator-in-chief before being substituted to a standing ovation in the closing stages. Arsenal have been presented with examinations of different types on a regular basis in this impressive attempt to win a first title since 2004 - and they passed this one with flying colours.The Gunners dug deep to come from two goals down to beat Bournemouth in the 97th minute in last weekend's game at Emirates Stadium, while here they stamped their authority all over a lacklustre Fulham from the first whistle. Manchester City had asked the question by winning at Selhurst Park. Arsenal provided the answer at Craven Cottage with their fifth successive Premier League win.Fulham in danger of fadingMarco Silva's Fulham have been an outstanding addition to the  top flight this season - a surprise package given they were rated as relegation favourites by many. Here, however, they were well short of the standards they have set and this comprehensive defeat capped a disappointing week after losing the west London derby at Brentford on Monday. There were mitigating circumstances with two of their most influential performers missing, Willian ruled out with a back muscle injury and Joao Palhinha suspended. The goals have also dried up for main marksman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who has 11 this season, but last scored in January.After a below-par display, Fulham only came to life after the break when the game was effectively over. Currently in eighth place, they have done so well to put themselves in contention for European football next season.Silva's main task now is to ensure the conclusion to this campaign does not drift away into anti-climax.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64852078
10,Man Utd 0-0 Southampton: Saints earn draw against 10-man Man Utd,SUN 12 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Casemiro has picked up two red cards for Manchester United this seasonManchester United manager Erik ten Hag has defended Casemiro after a Premier League red card against bottom club Southampton that leaves the midfielder facing a four-match ban. Casemiro was dismissed after 34 minutes of the 0-0 draw for a tackle on Carlos Alcaraz, but Ten Hag has not ruled out an appeal.The midfielder's sending off followed a VAR review, with referee Anthony Taylor overturning his initial decision to show a yellow card for a tackle that hit the top of the ball first before going into Southampton forward Alcaraz's leg.As Casemiro was also dismissed against Crystal Palace last month, an additional game will be added to an automatic three-match ban, meaning he won't be able to play a domestic match again until the trip to Nottingham Forest on 15 April.""When you freeze anything it looks bad - but everyone who knows something about top football knows what is bad and what is fair,"" said Ten Hag. ""And Casemiro is a really fair player. Tough but fair.""It shows, he had played over 500 games in big leagues and never been sent off. Now it has happened twice.""Ten Hag complained about the lack of consistency in the use of VAR, noting the referee was not sent to the monitor to review controversial incidents in Saturday's game between Leicester and Chelsea. Despite having a man advantage for almost an hour and managing 17 shots, Southampton were unable to capitalise and remain bottom of the Premier League. Even before Casemiro's early exit, David de Gea needed to make a brilliant reaction save to turn away Theo Walcott's close-range header.De Gea then produced a one-handed save after the break when Walcott ran clear of the home defence, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line when Scott McTominay turned a Kyle Walker-Peters cross towards his own goal. In addition, James Ward-Prowse's free-kick skimmed of the top of the bar and Walker-Peters also hit a post with an angled drive.United had some dangerous moments themselves, with captain Bruno Fernandes' goalbound effort tipped on to the inside of a post by Gavin Bazunu.The result consolidated United's top-four position, whilst Southampton are effectively three points from safety given their goal difference, with 12 games of the campaign remaining.Go straight to all the best Manchester United contentVisit our Southampton pageSouthampton show improvementDespite their position in the table, Southampton's form is good.They have now picked up seven points from four games since Nathan Jones was sacked on 12 February.It represents their most productive run since August and Wednesday's rearranged game with Brentford does offer the opportunity for Ruben Selles' side to climb out of the relegation zone for the first time since the end of October.Nevertheless, their goalscoring is a concern - in only one league match since August have they scored more than once. They had the chances to improve that statistic at Old Trafford but couldn't make them count.Casemiro's ill disciplineCasemiro has been one of the key reasons behind United's improvement this season.But the positivity around the Brazilian is in danger of being undermined by his disciplinary record.Sent off against Crystal Palace last month for grabbing Will Hughes round the neck following a mass confrontation, his latest red card was also triggered by the intervention of VAR.Casemiro did play the top of the ball first but Taylor decided the tackle was dangerous.Ten Hag said Casemiro was emotional in the dressing room afterwards. ""He is disappointed,"" Ten Hag said.Unless United manage a successful appeal, the four-match suspension would rule him out of next week's FA Cup quarter-final with Fulham, plus the three Premier League games that follow.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64852076
11,West Ham United 1-1 Aston Villa: Hammers move out of bottom three with point,SUN 12 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Ollie Watkins has been involved in eight goals in his past 11 Premier League gamesWest Ham earned a point against Aston Villa which saw David Moyes' struggling side move out of the Premier League relegation places on goal difference.Villa striker Ollie Watkins continued his impressive form as he broke the deadlock with a 17th-minute header from left-back Alex Moreno's sublime cross for his sixth goal in seven games.The lively Said Benrahma took his opportunity to respond for the hosts from the penalty spot nine minutes later, firing his spot-kick out of reach of World Cup winner Emiliano Martinez after Leon Bailey's foul on Lucas Paqueta.Benrahma was the standout attacking threat on either side at London Stadium but the winger saw a powerful strike from distance tipped over by Martinez in the second half among his match-leading 10 shots on goal.Denied again by Ashley Young's last-ditch block the Algeria international was unable to inspire the hosts to victory - although the point was enough to take West Ham above Bournemouth, who beat Liverpool on Saturday, to 17th in the standings.Aston Villa, whose appeals for a penalty of their own were dismissed by the video assistant referee following Declan Rice's challenge on Emiliano Buendia, remain 11th.Live text coverage of Sunday's Premier League actionGo straight to all the best West Ham contentVisit our Aston Villa pageBenrahma excites but Hammers in troubleSaid Benrahma has converted all seven of his penalties in league football in England (three for West ham, four for Brentford)The pressure is building on Moyes to prove he can steer West Ham to safety and the urgent need for the Hammers to begin adding to their six wins this season was reinforced by victories for relegation rivals Bournemouth and Everton a day earlier.Those results saw the Hammers - who have slipped a long way from the heights of securing European football in successive seasons - drop into the bottom three with a third of the season remaining, despite an outlay of around £160m on new players.And while the draw marginally improved their immediate situation, the fans, just as they did following the 4-0 thumping by Brighton, made their feelings clear as the full-time whistle was met with boos.Benrahma led by example as the home side looked to put last weekend's setback behind them, combining driving runs with several quality attempts as he became only the third player to register as many as 10 shots in a Premier League game this season.But despite landing half of those on target, with Martinez and Young both making crucial interventions for Villa, he could not add to his spectacular penalty as the visitors held out for a point.Things look rather different for Aston Villa since Unai Emery took charge in November, with their relegation concerns a reassuring 11 points behind them and a top-half finish within reach.A rejuvenated Watkins has been at the forefront of their recovery, and the 27-year-old has surely put himself in contention for inclusion in Gareth Southgate's latest England squad, to be announced next week before the start of the Three Lions' Euro 2024 qualifying campaign.Only Marcus Rashford (10), Erling Haaland (10) and Harry Kane (8) have scored more goals in the competition than Watkins since the Premier League season resumed in December.He expertly arrowed his header into the ground, the bounce beating Alphonse Areola, although he did miss a terrific chance to add to his tally when he shot at the West Ham goalkeeper at close range.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64852093

""Alexander Isak scored a massive goal for us. When it's a one-goal lead, it's very delicate. It should have been more at half-time.""Wolves came back into the game, but the character shown by the group to go again and get the winning goal is a great feeling for us.""After a quiet start, their opener arrived when Kieran Trippier's dangerous free kick was met by Isak, who edged clear of his marker and buried a powerful header into the corner.That sparked Newcastle into life and they came close to a second goal when Bruno Guimaraes hit the bar with a header from close range after Dan Burn had helped Trippier's corner back into the six-yard box.Trippier was guilty of a defensive error to allow Wolves to level in the second half when he slipped and collided with Pope as he attempted a clearance, the ball falling at the feet of Hwang, who tapped into an open net seconds after coming on to the pitch.After Almiron restored Newcastle's lead, Sven Botman came close to a third in stoppage time when he blazed wide from six yards after some wonderful interplay between the Paraguayan and Guimaraes.Wolves rue non-penalty callThough Newcastle deserved their victory, Wolves will feel the decisive moment of the match went against them when it was still goalless.Pope miscontrolled a back pass that was intercepted by Jimenez and the Mexico striker appeared to be bodychecked by the England goalkeeper as he attempted to run on to the ball.Referee Madley, who was a considerable distance away, waved away their appeals and the video assistant referee did not ask the official to take a second look on the monitor.""For me, we should have had a penalty. We are very unlucky with the referee,"" Lopetegui told Sky Sports.""In the second half, we improved a lot. We changed a lot of things and were able to get at them.""It was a pity that we had no changes left to make after they scored. We lost against a very good team.""Despite going into the game as the Premier League's lowest scorers, Wolves created a number of decent opportunities, with Daniel Podence hitting the post with a fizzing low drive shortly before the interval, while Pedro Neto and Joao Moutinho drew smart stops from Pope before Hwang's equaliser.But the defeat, combined with results elsewhere over the weekend, has allowed a number of teams below Wolves to close the gap in what becoming an unpredictable relegation battle, with just five points separating the bottom nine.That makes Wolves' next two matches, against fellow strugglers Leeds and Nottingham Forest, hugely significant as they look to secure a fifth successive season in the top flight.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64852077

The Blues started the day 18th but capitalised on teams around them failing to win by moving out of the Premier League relegation zone, leaping two points and three places above trouble.McNeil's delightful strike after just 35 seconds gave the hosts the perfect start, rasping a finish across goal which nestled into the far corner.Buoyed by a vocal crowd, the home side were swarming all over the Bees and created much the better chances with Demarai Gray seeing a second goal ruled out for handball by VAR.Brentford looked to salvage something from the game but were not at their best, Ethan Pinnock having a header cleared off the line by McNeil and Kevin Schade heading wide at the far post as their 12-match unbeaten run ended.Manager Dyche said: ""I spoke to the players and media about building a firmer mentality in my way and my thinking of football.""The players are adapting, working hard, but we are finding that balance in making the defence more resilient and creating more chances.""There is no lack of effort since I have been here and the crowd play a massive part for us in the end.

There are strong signs that the mentality is growing.""Reaction from Saturday's Premier League gamesBattling Toffees given hopeDyche said ""every"" league game is now a must-win as he looks to preserve Everton's top-flight status.But after seeing Bournemouth beat Liverpool earlier on Saturday, then Nottingham Forest, Leicester and Leeds all dropping points around them, the Toffees needed a win.A gritty, battling performance allowed them to hold on to McNeil's first-minute goal to collect their third 1-0 victory in seven games since Dyche's appointment in January.After 26 games this season Everton had 22 points, identical to the same stage under Frank Lampard last term when the former Chelsea boss guided them to safety.Five victories in their remaining games was sufficient on that occasion, and now they have real hope of doing the same under the ex-Burnley manager - with Dyche's former Clarets player McNeil the match-winner at Goodison Park.Everton should have been out of sight but Michael Keane headed wide when the goal was gaping after beating David Raya to the ball, while Amadou Onana screwed over from eight yards with the goal at his mercy.The lively Gray - who was unlucky to have a goal chalked off - saw a low shot saved by Raya and the Brentford goalkeeper also kept out Alex Iwobi's close-range effort from the resulting corner.""The win was satisfying for different reasons,"" said Dyche. ""The first half we were very good, you could arguably say we should have gone more in front - we were effective.""In the second half they were a team 12 unbeaten, a good outfit that has matured and they came back into it.""It was good play from them.

They are still only 10th but now sit just two points off a potential European place.They led from their first major chance when Chilwell met Kalidou Koulibaly's cross to smash home, a goal he celebrated against his former employers.It could have been even better with Felix clipping a shot past Danny Ward which hit the post, then finding the net from Ruben Loftus-Cheek's cross. With everyone back at the centre circle ready to restart, it was ruled out by the VAR because Felix was offside.Havertz did put them back into the lead with a clever finish from Fernandez's ball.The £89m Ukraine forward Mudryk sped away from Leicester's defence to slot in but he was ruled outside. Not long after he had his first assist in English football as Havertz crossed from the right and Mudryk headed down for Kovacic to lash in.The goal was checked by the VAR for a potential Havertz offside but the goal was given.Pressure grows on Rodgers?Leicester's season is ridiculously streaky. They started the season terribly and then went on a great run before the World Cup. Then they lost their first four Premier League games after the break, before going three unbeaten and now losing four in a row (five including the FA Cup defeat by Blackburn).This latest decline has taken them to within touching distance of the relegation zone and they were booed off at full-time.Five losses in a row is their worst run since November to December 2014. They have suffered 16 Premier League defeats in a season for only the second time - the most Rodgers has ever lost in a league season in his managerial career.Not taking chances has been one of their issues this season - and they had 17 shots here (to Chelsea's 12), but only netted once.James Maddison was one of their star performers again with five shots, two on target, and three chances created. But none ended up in the net.He should have had an assist when his free-kick landed on the head of Daniel Amartey in front of an open goal but the defender somehow missed.Dewsbury-Hall cracked a deflected shot off the angle of bar and post from 25 yards out.The chances continued in the second half with Harry Souttar having an effort cleared off the line by Conor Gallagher and Dewsbury-Hall mis-kicking when he had an easy chance from six yards out.Their misery was compounded when Faes lunged in on Carney Chukwuemeka and was shown his second yellow card.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64845518

Brennan Johnson stung Forster's palms with a low drive before Serge Aurier's header was acrobatically tipped over the crossbar by the Tottenham goalkeeper.Worrall did get on the scoreboard when he headed into an empty net after Forster had missed his punch at a corner, but Ayew's late penalty miss ended Forest's hopes of an unlikely comeback.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64845521

Still we are there,"" Guardiola told Sky Sports.""Here in the typical winter game, a difficult one, we were there all the time and then we won it.""Now we have to do absolutely everything and next Tuesday and Saturday.

Their wait for a shot on target will now extend to a fourth game after setting a competition record since Opta began recording such data in 2003-04.They were handed a rare first-half opening when Olise dispossessed Foden in midfield and set Wilfried Zaha away, while substitute Eberechi Eze saw an attempt blocked amid a late search for an equaliser.Palace's five points in 2023 is the lowest in the division, and just four points separate Vieira's misfiring side from the relegation places before difficult trips to Brighton and then Arsenal.

Bees' striker Ivan Toney was the talisman once more, making it 22 successes out of 22 from the penalty spot for Brentford as they closed to within three points of sixth-placed Newcastle United. Toney is playing under a cloud as he faces a ban after accepting breaking Football Association betting rules, but he was outstanding here as Brentford secured a deserved three points. Thomas Frank's side made a lightning start and could have scored three times even before Ethan Pinnock's shot deflected off Tim Ream to put Brentford ahead after only six minutes. Fulham are having an outstanding season of their own, and they finally gained a foothold before drawing level six minutes before the break when Israel forward Manor Solomon continued his rich vein of form, heading in the rebound after Andreas Pereira's free-kick struck the post. Brentford regained the momentum, with both Bryan Mbeumo and Toney hitting the woodwork with free-kicks, and were awarded a 53rd-minute penalty when Issa Diop fouled Christian Norgaard. Toney, as is his custom, beat Bernd Leno with ease.Mathias Jensen sealed the win from close range five minutes from time following good work by Kevin Schade with Carlos Vinicius' stoppage-time goal for Fulham nothing more than a consolation.Buoyant Brentford's European dream grows closerHow did you rate Brentford's performance?

Toney's immediate future is under that cloud after alleged breaches of betting rules and there is no doubt any absence would be a huge setback, but such is the spirit, character and ability built by Frank in this side that they could yet take it in their stride. Brentford started with so much pace and intensity they threatened to blow Fulham away, and then showed their self-belief and resilience to regather their forces after Marco Silva's side forced their way back into contention with an equaliser. Those supporters who pack into the Gtech Community Stadium are living the dream and it shows no sign of ending yet.Asked whether Brentford can make the European places, Frank told BBC Sport: ""For me it is very important that we are allowed to dream.

Vinicius' late bundled goal gave the scoreline a flattering appearance for Fulham as it came with virtually the last kick of the game. Silva's big players Aleksandar Mitrovic and Willian were unable to exert any influence, snuffed out by Brentford's defending, and both endured a frustrating evening. There was hope when the prolific Solomon reacted first to Pereira's shot hitting the woodwork but Brentford soon re-asserted their authority.

I thought he got lots of decisions wrong. ""He will know that and he will probably have to explain his performance as well.

21,Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United: Reds thrash old rivals in Anfield rout,SUN 05 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Liverpool delivered the complete performance and Mohamed Salah became the club's record Premier League goalscorer as Manchester United were overwhelmed at a joyous Anfield. United's renaissance under manager Erik ten Hag already has the tangible reward of the Carabao Cup but Liverpool unleashed a brutal reality check on their progress with a severe thrashing. Liverpool took control of what had been a tight game, with Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford missing presentable chances, when former Old Trafford target Cody Gakpo applied a smooth finish to Andy Robertson's perfect pass two minutes before the break. The second half was a tale of sheer joy for Liverpool and unrelenting misery for United, starting after 47 minutes when Darwin Nunez's header diverted Harvey Elliott's driven cross past goalkeeper David de Gea. Salah bamboozled Lisandro Martinez to play in Gakpo for another classy finish three minutes later before the Egyptian resumed his long-time role of United tormentor by getting on the scoresheet himself. Salah ended a swift counter-attack by lashing a finish high past De Gea and the rout continued as Nunez flashed another header in from Jordan Henderson's cross.Salah then scrambled in the sixth to become Liverpool's highest Premier League goalscorer with 129, passing Robbie Fowler. He is also Liverpool's highest marksman against Manchester United with 12 - and 10 of those have come in his past five encounters. And in a fitting finish, Roberto Firmino - who has announced he is leaving Anfield at the end of the season - completed a remarkable game by making it 7-0 from close range. This is the biggest win in the history of the fixture, passing Liverpool's 7-1 victory in the 1895-96 Second Division.Liverpool are now an ominous presence in the chase for the Champions League places, standing only three points behind Tottenham with a game in hand.Mohamed Salah broke Robbie Fowler's record of 128 Premier League goals for LiverpoolFollow Liverpool v Manchester United reaction hereHow did you rate Liverpool's performance?

Send us your views hereLiverpool find the fire and fury Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United: Jurgen Klopp delighted with 'super-dominant' performanceLiverpool have resembled a shadow of their real selves this season. The old guarantees, such as intensity and firepower, have been missing far too often. They all returned here - and how - in the most spectacular manner as Manchester United, who have been undergoing a revival this season, were blown away by a team in full cry. Once Jurgen Klopp's side took control of a tightly contested game just before half-time, they were ruthless. They scored seven, and missed chances to get more.Klopp wanted this to be a pivotal week in the race for the top four as his team look to salvage something from a season that has, to this point, been below par.His players responded. Wolverhampton Wanderers were beaten at Anfield and United, to put it mildly, outclassed. Liverpool won 5-0 at Old Trafford and 4-0 at Anfield in the Premier League last season while United had a 2-1 win at home early in this campaign to get the Ten Hag era going - and this was another remarkable game to add to that catalogue. Gakpo was on United's wanted list before he moved to Liverpool in January and his two cool finishes showed why Ten Hag was a fan. Nunez demonstrated his growing threat with a double while Salah always rises to the occasion against United and punished them once more. There was even the perfect finale of a goal in front of the Kop for Firmino, who announced on Friday he would end a great Liverpool career at the conclusion of this season.  Liverpool manager Klopp resisted a fist pump celebration in front of the Kop - but for him, this day could not have gone any better. Embarrassment for Man UtdLiverpool 7-0 Manchester United: Erik ten Hag 'angry' with 'unprofessional' performanceIn seven days, Manchester United have gone from the high of their first trophy since 2017 with the Carabao Cup win against Newcastle United at Wembley to the pain of abject humiliation at Anfield.Bizarrely, United were right in this game for 43 minutes, with Fernandes and Rashford missing arguably the game's two best chances before Gakpo scored and the sky fell in on Ten Hag's team. United have had a heavy programme of fixtures but the manner in which they capitulated must be an embarrassment for manager, players and fans. There can be no excuses.Argentine defender Martinez, normally so reliable and combative, was taken apart, especially when Salah led him a merry dance to set up Gakpo to settle the game with Liverpool's third five minutes after half-time. To lose against Liverpool is a painful business at any time but to be on the receiving end of what was a record defeat in this fixture will send shock waves through Old Trafford. They must have thought it could not get worse than the 5-0 home thrashing last season - but this was and was inflicted in front of an ecstatic Anfield. Manchester United must now lick their wounds and return to Europa League action at home to Real Betis on Thursday - and those wounds will hurt after this beating at the home of their arch-rivals.

Newcastle responded well and were causing plenty of problems until City substitute Bernardo Silva slotted home to put the game out of their reach midway through the second half. The win means City move to within two points of the Gunners, who play Bournemouth later on Saturday, while Newcastle remain fifth, four points behind Tottenham.While the result will be disappointing for Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, as his side looked to bounce back from last weekend's Carabao Cup final defeat, there were plenty of positives for him in defeat.His side were on top when Erling Haaland set up Silva to make it 2-0 from the edge of the area, with Joelinton going close and substitute Alexander Isak denied by an onrushing Ederson.Isak was particularly impressive whenever he was on the ball and his return to full fitness will be a big boost for Newcastle, who have now won only one of their past eight league games, as they look to rescue their stalling season.Reaction to Man City v NewcastleWhat did you make of Manchester City's performance?

He replaced Emile Smith Rowe, himself a sub for Leandro Trossard, who suffered a first half injury.However it is with unexpected twists, remarkable moments and incredible goals that titles are often won.Billing's rocket start in vain for CherriesDevastating to lose like that - O'NeilArteta would have wanted his side to make a fast start in order to restore their advantage over City. He got the exact opposite.From the kick-off, Joe Rothwell fed a pass wide to Dango Ouattara, whose low ball across the box was dummied by Dominic Solanke and missed by Gabriel, who allowed it beneath his studs. Billing escaped William Saliba's lax marking, and finished under Aaron Ramsdale.With the form which earned Gary O'Neil the permanent manager's seat a distant memory, and now just one win in their last 12 games, a win - or even a point - would have provided a real boost for Bournemouth in their bid to escape relegation.However, like Arsenal, their defence is their weakness. Nelson's strike was the 35th goal they have conceded in away Premier League matches this season - a division high.The greater damage however could be psychological, with players, fans and O'Neil all left in despair by the late winner.For a long time, Bournemouth defended their very early lead with stubbornness and co-ordination, marshalled well by goalkeeper-captain Neto, who made a terrific double save from Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka just minutes after Billing's opener.Bournemouth were happy to attack on the break, and should have gone two ahead before half-time, Ramsdale making a superb spreading save to deny Dango Ouattara as the visitors countered from an Arsenal corner.However they dropped deeper as the game progressed - until the decisive blow in the final seconds.Partey gets the late party startedWhile Arsenal continue to lead the pack in their pursuit of a first Premier League title in 19 years, they also have clear defensive frailties - they now have just three clean sheets in their past 18 home league games.Arteta may have thought the return of Partey to central midfield, his first start in three weeks, would have given a defensive boost. But the Ghanaian, playing in front of his national team manager Chris Hughton, was at fault for the Bournemouth second.Partey lost his man Senesi from a 57th-minute corner, allowing the Italian defender a free near-post header past Ramsdale.He started to make amends with Arsenal's first goal, volleying home from six yards - before Nelson took over.Match of the Day: Ian Wright's reaction to Arsenal's late winner",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64768041

""I'm sure the manager won't be pleased with the second-half performance but it's a win and we've been craving a win here for a while.""Great to get the three points and it gives us an opportunity to look up and not down.""Any thought of a relegation battle can now be put behind them, and with just five points separating Emery's side from Liverpool in sixth, a strong finish to the campaign could lead to European football next season.The performance level would have to increase significantly, but there was quality in flashes - particularly when Buendia and McGinn got on the ball - and there is the chance for a far more exciting climax to the season than looked likely a couple of months ago.More Aston Villa contentGo to our Crystal Palace page",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64768042
25,Brighton & Hove Albion 4-0 West Ham United: Alexis Mac Allister among scorers in Albion win,SAT 04 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Alexis Mac Allister scored his first Premier League goal since winning the World Cup with Argentina to put Brighton in frontBrighton boosted their hopes of European qualification with a thumping Premier League victory over struggling West Ham that increases the pressure on Hammers boss David Moyes.Alexis Mac Allister put Albion in front midway through the first half, converting from the spot after Jarrod Bowen bundled Kaoru Mitoma over in the area.Substitute Joel Veltman doubled the hosts' lead soon after half-time, chesting the ball in at the far post following a corner, before Mitoma slid in to make it 3-0.Danny Welbeck added further gloss to the scoreline late on, drilling a right-footed shot into the bottom corner to condemn the Hammers to their biggest defeat of the season.It was no more than Brighton deserved as they cut loose in the second half, producing a swaggering attacking display that could have seen them win by an even greater margin.Moyes' side went into the match having lost just one of their past five league games, including thrashing Nottingham Forest 4-0 in their previous fixture, but this result and performance provided a stark reality check. Bowen and Tomas Soucek forced Jason Steele - making only his second top-flight appearance at the age of 32 - into smart saves when it was still 1-0, but they rarely threatened otherwise and remain just two points above the bottom three.What did you make of Brighton's display?

26,Chelsea 1-0 Leeds United: Wesley Fofana scores to ease pressure on Graham Potter,SAT 04 Mar 2023,premier-league,"Chelsea scored for the first time since 11 FebruaryWelsey Fofana scored his first Premier League goal for Chelsea as the Blues beat Leeds to ease the pressure on manager Graham Potter.After a run of just two wins in their past 15 games, there was a sense that three points were a must for Potter, despite insisting he retained the support of the club's owners before the game.The Blues made a blistering start and could have been 3-0 up inside 30 minutes. Kai Havertz was one-on-one with Leeds keeper Illan Meslier, while Joao Felix smashed a shot from distance against the crossbar before Ben Chilwell prodded wide from an excellent position.After that there was a growing sense of deja vu around Stamford Bridge as Chelsea faded while Leeds grew into the game, with Jack Harrison sending a free-kick over the bar before the break.But Fofana ended Chelsea's run of 396 minutes without a goal when he rose to head home from a corner early in the second half.Leeds upped the pressure in the closing stages as the hosts dropped deep to try and hold on for a precious win, making for a nervous finale to the game for the home fans, but they held on to secure their second win this year.Chelsea remain 10th despite the win while Leeds are 17th and one point above the relegation zone.Follow Saturday's Premier League actionHow did you rate Chelsea's performance?

If the Blues can follow this up by progressing in the Champions League, then this could prove to be the turning point Potter needs.No joy away from home again for LeedsLeeds have to improve in front of goal - GraciaA significant factor in Leeds struggling near the bottom of the table this season has been their terrible away form.They had won just once before the trip to Stamford Bridge, picking up just six points, but they did comfortably beat Chelsea 3-0 in the reverse fixture and must have fancied their chances against a side struggling for goals.But that is a problem Leeds share. They have played plenty of excellent football this season but it often falls apart in the final third and once again they simply failed to trouble the opposition goalkeeper enough in this game. They did not manage any shots on target until the 90th minute, when goalkeeper Meslier headed a last-gasp free-kick at his Chelsea counterpart Kepa Arrizabalaga.A positive result at Stamford Bridge would have been a bonus for Leeds, who will likely target points elsewhere in their battle to stay in the Premier League.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64768039

Spurs had the better of the chances and twice hit the woodwork, but the crossbar came to Wolves' aid as Traore's effort flew in past Fraser Forster.Wolves, who are now 13th, had been on the back foot for most of the game but made their late momentum count.Spurs' inconsistent form continued as they dropped important points in the race for a top four spot.The first half was fraught with stoppages and neither side built any real momentum, despite some early pressure from Spurs.There were eight minutes of added time after a long break in play, as Wolves striker Diego Costa was carried off on a stretcher with a knee injury, suffered in an awkward fall following a jump.Tottenham's Pedro Porro came the closest to an opener when he struck the woodwork with a powerful free-kick shortly before the break.And just after the restart, Son Heung-min, who had been the first half's most promising player, hit the crossbar from close range.Wolves, pinned in their own half for much of the opening 45 minutes, were improved after the interval, and Nelson Semedo was inches from connecting with a Raul Jimenez ball across goal.Jimenez was then denied a first Premier League goal of the season when his header from close range was batted away by Forster.The momentum continued to swing in Wolves' favour with a string of trademark long-distance Ruben Neves efforts testing the Tottenham goalkeeper.And Traore sealed all three points for the hosts when he sent the ball rocketing in off the underside of the bar.Reaction to Wolves' win over TottenhamHow did you rate Wolves' performance?

Southampton's victory was just their second at home in the league this season and moved them off the foot of the table into 19th, one point behind 17th-placed Leeds and a position of safety.Leicester could have gone as high as 12th with a win, but instead remain 15th, three points clear of the drop zone.How did you rate Southampton's performance?

The flag went up for offside after he drove past Jordan Pickford but the decision was overturned after a VAR check.Everton had no answers and Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard wrapped up their third successive league victory when he side-footed home Leandro Trossard's cross after 71 minutes.It was now simply a question of how many Arsenal would score to improve their goal difference, Martinelli adding his second and the Gunners' fourth from Eddie Nketiah's cross ten minutes from time.'Thrashing of Everton confirms Arsenal are in this title race to stay'Saka Arsenal's star once moreArsenal 4-0 Everton: Mikel Arteta 'delighted' with victory over EvertonMartinelli once again demonstrated his rich promise with two crisp finishes but Saka was the star of the show, giving a glorious illustration of his significance to this Arsenal side.He became the sixth-youngest player in Premier League history, at 21, to reach 50 goals and assists as he ensured the frustration that threatened Arsenal was wiped away in the crucial minutes before half-time.Saka gave Pickford no chance when he lashed a powerful drive past the England goalkeeper at his near post, then his speed of thought and action robbed Gueye to play in Martinelli. It was game over after that.Arsenal played so fluently as Everton subsided, and in the final reckoning the scoreline could have been even more emphatic.The Gunners' character and resilience was put to the test after the damaging home loss to nearest rivals Manchester City, but they have responded brilliantly with wins at Aston Villa and Leicester City, then this cruise against an Everton side in desperate trouble.Everton in deep troubleArsenal 4-0 Everton: There's plenty of work to be done, says Sean DycheDyche started his reign as Everton manager with a win over Arsenal at Goodison Park that hinted at a possible revival - fast forward to this hammering and the brutal reality is clear.Everton held their own for 40 minutes but even when they got into threatening positions they lacked any sort of bite.They have not scored more than once for 15 games, the last time coming in a 3-0 win against Crystal Palace on 22 October.It makes the decision to go through the January transfer window without adding a striker, indeed without adding anyone, look even more like negligence on the part of the club's hierarchy, including director of football Kevin Thelwell.Dyche has won two and lost three of his first five games, and those winning goals against Arsenal and Leeds United have come from central defender James Tarkowski and veteran full-back Seamus Coleman.And the manner in which Everton collapsed once they went behind, showing a complete lack of confidence and self-belief, is a serious worry for Dyche and their long-term Premier League prospects.This weekend's visit to Nottingham Forest now assumes even greater importance as Everton face yet another season of crisis.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62784289

Jose Sa made a good save but Jota kept the ball in and the Netherlands defender's second header from close range found the roof of the net.It audibly lifted the tension around Anfield and Liverpool's second goal was a much more pretty sight. Alisson found Tsimikas with a raking pass to the left and the Greece left-back raced into the area before pulling back to Salah.The Egypt forward guided the cross in off his thigh to move one goal short of equalling Robbie Fowler's haul of 128 Premier League goals for Liverpool.Following the chastening 5-2 home defeat to Real Madrid and the dour draw at Palace at the weekend, this was a much-need lift for Liverpool before the game against Manchester United this weekend.Liverpool 2-0 Wolves: Not easy to be positive - Julen LopeteguiWolves lack bite once againBefore taking the lead, moments of quality from Liverpool at a subdued Anfield were rare. When they did create an opening it was usually through the determination and running power of Nunez.In the 35th minute, the former Benfica striker raced on to a pass and cut the ball back from the touchline only to see the recalled Harvey Elliott wastefully head wide from eight yards.Just after the hour mark Nunez appeared to have put Liverpool ahead, finishing a loose ball smartly from six yards. However, Jota was judged by VAR to have caught Nelson Semedo as he carried the ball into the box and referee Paul Tierney ruled the goal out after consulting the pitch-side monitor.""I think you all saw the [disallowed] goal now a couple of times back and when you see it in slow motion you see the contact, but I still think it was a goal - but that's not important anymore,"" Klopp said.""The players don't have a replay and for them it's a clear goal of course. Then you have to react.""I was not worried but of course then you watch how the boys react - and the reaction was really good.""Liverpool fans may have feared this was going to be the defining moment of the game but Van Dijk intervened soon after with the goal his side's play just about warranted.Wolves defended stoutly and with organisation but were again toothless in front of goal, hamstrung by the absence of Matheus Cunha. The Brazil striker failed a late fitness test following an ankle injury picked up at Fulham on Friday.His replacement in the starting XI was midfielder Joao Moutinho as manager Julen Lopetegui reverted to a three-man midfield with the Portuguese veteran sitting alongside Mario Lemina and Ruben Neves.It effectively stifled Liverpool for some time, but Wolves may well have to offer a bit more than just discipline in the coming weeks to ensure their Premier League status for 2023-24.""It was frustrating because we didn't get anything - but we didn't deserve to get anything,"" Lopetegui said.""Maybe in the first half but in the second half we didn't keep the rhythm and when they scored it was more difficult of course.""We lost one match - it's a pity, but we have to change our mindset very fast as in three days we have another important match [at home to Tottenham].

It's a great win, we re-wrote the history of this club,"" Osimhen said.""We keep dreaming, we don't have limits. We follow our coach and look ahead.""With a commanding 18-point lead at the top of Serie A, Napoli head into the last eight with a real chance to compete for top prize in European football.Eintracht fans clash with police in NaplesThe build-up to the match had been overshadowed as Eintracht Frankfurt fans clashed with police after arriving in Naples despite being banned from attending the second leg of the last-16 tie.Once the game did start, it was the visitors who had the first effort of note as Rafael Borre headed off target in the 10th minute but from there Napoli took charge.The electric Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was the main threat in the first half, slaloming through the Frankfurt defence in the 19th minute before seeing his effort from a tight angle saved by Kevin Trapp in the visitors' goal.Kvaratskhelia went close again three minutes before the break after another driving run but was again denied by Trapp.The breakthrough came on the stroke of half-time when Matteo Politano dug out a cross from the right and Osimhen powered the header back past the goalkeeper.After the break, with the tie all but settled, Napoli were able to show more of the attacking flair that has brought them such success this season and after good work from Di Lorenzo down the right, Osimhen was waiting to finish as he stretched at the far post.The goal was Napoli's 24th in this season's Champions League, taking them past Benfica as the competition's top scorers and when Djibril Sow upended Zielinski with a clumsy challenge in the box, the Polish midfielder calmly dispatched the 64th-minute spot kick to make it 25.Frankfurt did have the chance to make the game slightly more nervy before the penalty but Daichi Kamada failed to convert from inside the six yard box.As it was, Napoli were able to enjoy the last half hour as they completed the joint-largest aggregate win by an Italian side in the Champions League knockout stages to join Serie A rivals Inter and AC Milan in the quarters.Will Napoli's Osimhen make Premier League move?",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64969965

However afterwards the striker said he will be fine for Sunday's must-win El Clasico with Barcelona.Klopp admits to 'massive task' - has he been too loyal?Liverpool news and fan views in one placeNo miracle of MadridChampions League is 'the' competition, we want to be part of it - KloppThis was the 92nd time a team have lost by three or more goals in the first leg at home in a European Cup tie. All 92 have been eliminated.Data analysts Gracenote gave Liverpool a 3.92% probability of progression and Jurgen Klopp talked about a ""1% chance"" beforehand.That was the challenge they faced after Madrid put on an exhibition of taking their chances at Anfield.But still, this is Liverpool and this is the Champions League. In 2005 they came from 3-0 down to beat Ancelotti's Milan in the Champions League final. Three years ago they lost 3-0 to Barcelona and won the second leg 4-0, although crucially that was at home.Liverpool gave it a go - they had to - with forwards Diogo Jota, Nunez, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo in their line-up.Had Nunez scored after six minutes instead of shooting at Thibaut Courtois, who knows what might have happened. The Uruguayan forced another two saves from the goalkeeper, most notably with a fine curling effort after cutting in from the left wing.But really they were lucky to only lose this leg 1-0. There was no gung-ho, 'heavy metal', blockbuster attempt to go and win it.They did not even have a shot between James Milner's blocked effort in the 37th minute and Harvey Elliott's attempt on target after 82 minutes.It could have got slightly worse in injury time when referee Felix Zwayer went to the monitor to see if Konstantinos Tsimikas had handled the ball, but the decision was no penalty to Real.So just like in last year's final in Paris, and the previous season's quarter-final, Real were Liverpool's conquerors.The Reds will undoubtedly finish this season trophy-less and it will be a huge blow to their future plans if they cannot overtake Newcastle and Tottenham to finish fourth in the Premier League come the end of the season.Champions League kings march onAncelotti said beforehand that psychologically ""it's tougher for us than Liverpool"" because the Reds knew they had to go ""all out from the first minute"".But it was Real who had the bulk of the chances. They had 17 shots here, compared to the nine efforts that yielded five goals on Merseyside.Alisson somehow saved Vinicius' close-range volley with an outstretched arm. Then he tipped Camavinga's deflected, looping long-range strike on to the crossbar.Luka Modric drilled a shot just over from outside the box. After the break Alisson denied Federico Valverde and Benzema in quick succession.Valverde was unmarked when he headed another chance over.Eventually the pressure told when Benzema slotted in from Vinicius' ball as they got in behind the Reds' defence. That was his seventh Champions League goal against the Reds, a record for any player.Benzema said he took a kick to the shin but will be fit for Sunday's trip to the Nou Camp.

34,Manchester City 7-0 RB Leipzig (8-1 agg): Erling Haaland scores five as City cruise into quarter-finals,TUE 14 Mar 2023,champions-league,"Erling Haaland is the third player to score five goals in a single Champions League game after Luiz Adriano in October 2014 (Shakhtar Donetsk vs BATE Borisov) and Lionel Messi in March 2012 (Barcelona v Bayer Leverkusen)Erling Haaland rewrote the record books by scoring an incredible five times as Manchester City swept RB Leipzig aside to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.Haaland becomes the fastest and youngest player to reach 30 goals in Europe's elite club competition.He is also the youngest player to score five times in a single Champions League game, joining Argentina great Lionel Messi and Brazil forward Luiz Adriano as the only players to do so.The 22-year-old is now on 39 goals for the season in all competitions, the first City player to reach that figure in a single campaign. His five hat-tricks are three more than any other player in the big five leagues.On any normal day, Ilkay Gundogan's precise low shot into the bottom corner would have merited praise. On this historic night, which matched City's 7-0 triumph over Schalke in 2019, it was nothing more than a footnote.On this evidence, no-one, not even Real Madrid, will want to be paired with Pep Guardiola's side in Friday's last-eight draw. Legendary former club captain Vincent Kompany can only hope his old club have got this calibre of performance out of their system when he brings his Burnley side to Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup on Saturday.Records tumble as Haaland hits five past LeipzigChelsea and Man City await next European opponentsMan City news and fan views in one placeHaaland haunts former boss RoseLeipzig coach Marco Rose was Haaland's boss at Dortmund last season. Little wonder he reacted with incredulity on the eve of the game when it was pointed out to him that some feel City are a lesser team with the Norwegian in it.""It could get really, really, really good for him with Pep and Man City,"" was Rose's response.He would have preferred his words not to be proved quite so perceptive, quite so soon.Leipzig were given a very early warning about the difficulties that lay ahead when Nathan Ake dropped a long pass over their defence and in the space of half a dozen strides Haaland had sprinted clear of their defence and bore down on goal.Goalkeeper Janis Blaswich managed to deny Haaland the opener - but it was to be his last success of the night in that personal duel.Five-star Haaland offers up finishing masterclassRose may argue City should not have been awarded the penalty that gave Haaland the chance to open the scoring.True, Benjamin Henrichs was very close to Rodri - but once VAR intervened it was also obvious the defender had his arms out when the City man headed the ball against his hand. Haaland kept his cool, buried the penalty and, as the visiting bench were still grumbling at the unfairness of it all, made it 2-0 when he reacted quickest after De Bruyne's thunderous shot came back off the crossbar and headed into an empty net.And when Amadou Haidara's clearance off the line, after Blaswich had turned away Ruben Dias' header, bounced straight into the advancing Haaland to give him his hat-trick in first-half stoppage time, Leipzig might have been tempted to concede.But there was more punishment to come for the hapless visitors.Gundogan's well-taken strike was followed by Haaland's fourth, which came when Blaswich saved a Manuel Akanji effort and again it fell just right for the Norwegian.When he turned home a fifth for the first time in his career, Haaland had effectively scored five times in 35 minutes.Hs dad Alfie, watching from an executive box high in the stadium, was on his feet leading the applause.Probably wisely, Guardiola decided there was not much point in Haaland staying on the pitch. He left to a standing ovation from a crowd both appreciative and incredulous at what they had just seen.City eased off with the job emphatically done before De Bruyne scored with virtually the last kick as Leipzig were condemned to their heaviest European defeat.Latest Manchester City news, analysis and fan viewsGet Man City news notifications",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64943666
35,Bayern Munich 2-0 Paris St-Germain (3-0 agg): Hosts cruise into Champions League quarter-finals,WED 08 Mar 2023,champions-league,"Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting played for Paris St-Germain against Bayern Munich in the 2020 Champions League finalBayern Munich cruised into the quarter-finals of the Champions League as they condemned Paris St-Germain to another last-16 exit.Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting swept home just after the hour mark for the hosts against his former club, with substitute Serge Gnabry adding the gloss to a professional display late on.PSG have now been eliminated from the competition at this stage in five of their previous seven campaigns and this represented another dismal failure for the Ligue 1 leaders and their under-pressure head coach Christophe Galtier.Despite boasting a collection of stars, the Parisians not only failed to score over two legs but were saved the embarrassment of a four or five-goal aggregate defeat by a VAR decision and offside flag ruling out an earlier Choupo-Moting header and Sadio Mane's stoppage-time effort.Six-time European champions Bayern had begun the evening nervously defending a one-goal first-leg lead and guarding against the dual threat posed by Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi. However, while PSG's star forward line sporadically threatened early on neither was given the time or space to inflict any damage on a disciplined and efficient Bayern side, who ran out comfortable winners.The only major concern for the German champions arrived in the first period and was entirely self-inflicted.  Goalkeeper Yann Sommer - who was caught in possession by Achraf Hakimi - presented visiting midfielder Vitinha with an open goal but defender Matthijs de Ligt made a superb sliding intervention for the home side.The draw for the last eight of the competition takes place on 17 March in Nyon, Switzerland.Is Bayern's dominance bad for the Bundesliga?Reaction from Wednesday's Champions League actionEfficient Bayern prove too good for PSGSommer's mistake should have been punished and provided PSG with the momentum to go on and win the tie, in the same manner that Real Madrid did against them almost exactly 12 months ago.However, Vitinha's weak finish was symptomatic of a side that has promised much but too often failed to deliver on big European nights - and who failed to score in a knockout tie for the first time since the 1994-95 semi-finals against AC Milan.Sergio Ramos and Mbappe both saw second-half efforts well saved by Swiss international Sommer but by then the damage had been done and Bayern were in the ascendancy. The German side's control and strength in reserve was also underlined by their changes with Julian Nagelsmann able to introduce Gnabry, Mane, Joao Cancelo and Leroy Sane while bringing off the likes of Thomas Muller and the impressive Jamal Musiala.The impact of Portugal international Cancelo - who is on loan at Bayern from Manchester City - was immediate, as he laid on a goal for Gnabry within three minutes of his introduction to put the tie beyond doubt.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64879878
36,Tottenham 0-0 AC Milan (0-1 agg): Spurs out of Champions League after shutout,WED 08 Mar 2023,champions-league,"Tottenham are out of all the cup competitions they entered this seasonTottenham Hotspur's Champions League campaign ended in bitterly disappointing fashion as they failed to overturn a first-leg deficit in the last 16 against AC Milan. Spurs paid the price for another passive start that allowed Milan to settle into their task - the misery complete when defender Cristian Romero was sent off late on after receiving a second yellow card for a wild challenge on Theo Hernandez. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg tested AC Milan keeper Mike Maignan with a powerful second-half shot and Harry Kane headed wide, but Spurs failed to mount sustained pressure on the Italian defence. A late Kane header was brilliantly kept out by Maignan before Divock Origi struck the post for the visitors as Spurs went out tamely, their season now resting on the battle for a top-four place in the Premier League. 'End of Conte's loveless Spurs reign surely a formality'Bayern Munich cruise past Paris St-Germain to reach quarter-finalsReaction from all Wednesday's Champions League actionSpurs simply not good enoughSpurs fans reacted angrily as their Champions League campaign came to a conclusion and their discontent was understandable after such a dismal performance. The lack of urgency that has marked so much of their season has never been more stark than in the first 45 minutes when Spurs played as if they were barely aware they needed to score to keep their ambitions alive. Manager Antonio Conte returned to the technical area after recuperating from gallbladder surgery but this did not spare him the wrath of the Spurs support mystified by such a conservative approach. He was not helped by Romero's red card for a late, reckless tackle on Hernandez, having already received a first-half caution for a clumsy challenge to prevent Rafael Leao breaking clear.Kane almost rescued Spurs and sent the game into extra time with that late header, but for most of the night he was starved of meaningful service in a side largely devoid of creativity. What this means for Conte's long-term future remains to be seen, with growing uncertainty surrounding his position and his contract up at the end of the season. Spurs now have only that top-four place to fight for, and on this form you would not back them to achieve it. They have scrambled through much of this season despite indifferent form but there was to be no reprieve here - and they did not deserve one. Tomori top class for MilanFikayo Tomori has slipped out of the England reckoning, but his calm and measured performance was a timely reminder of the qualities he can offer should manager Gareth Southgate require them. The 25-year-old former Chelsea defender has matured in Serie A and was a rock in the Milan defence here - strong in the air, showing impeccable timing with his tackles and calm on the ground. Spurs hardly subjected Milan to intense scrutiny, but when needed Tomori was excellent and a key figure as they reached the quarter-finals. Milan were also well-served by keeper Maignan, faultless throughout and producing a moment of brilliance to keep out Kane in the closing seconds. Spurs can have no complaints over the two legs, with Milan probably surprised by the absence of intensity in front of a home crowd waiting for the opportunity to roar their side on.

I am not in control of that.""I understand why you are asking me that question and it has probably been aimed at me for some weeks now.""I can't really control that. I am not in that position to understand it and you are asking probably the wrong person. What I am is fully committed in trying to turn this around and that is what I will try to do.""Parker was sacked by Bournemouth in August following a 9-0 defeat by Liverpool, four games into the season.Benfica, who won the first leg 2-0, opened the scoring in the first half with a smart finish from Rafa Silva.Goncalo Ramos then showed great footwork to make it 4-0 on aggregate, before stabbing home from close range.Joao Mario's penalty and David Neres' finish wrapped up the win before Bjorn Meijer scored a stunning consolation.It is the second successive season Benfica have reached the Champions League quarter-finals, though they have never progressed further and were beaten by Liverpool at that stage last term.Scott Parker was appointed Club Bruges boss on 31 December 2022""The result hits us hard,"" said Club Bruges midfielder Hans Vanaken.""The way in which it happened was painful too, because we shipped the goals too easily.""I am emotional because we had a great campaign. You don't want to go out like that.""Club Bruges rarely looked like turning the tie around, with Benfica even having the ball in the net after two minutes through Joao Mario, but it was ruled out for offside.Reaction to Tuesday's Champions League gamesDespite that early chance, the visitors did well to hold off their opponents for 38 minutes and were starting to look threatening when Silva scored, keeping his cool to control the ball from a cross before slotting in.From then on Club Bruges capitulated as the tie looked beyond them and another fine finish, this time from Portugal forward Ramos, ended the game as a contest. Mario's penalty came either side of clinical finishes by Ramos and Neres, but Meijer did at least give the travelling fans something to cheer with an exquisite first-time finish into the top corner.Since the Champions League was formed, Benfica have lost all five quarter-finals they have played in, but this result and performance will give them hope of taking the next step.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64881073
38,Chelsea 2-0 Borussia Dortmund (agg 2-1): Blues fight back to reach last eight,TUE 07 Mar 2023,champions-league,"Kai Havertz converted his penalty at the second attemptGraham Potter enjoyed his finest night as Chelsea manager as they overcame a first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. Potter was under huge pressure after a dismal run of results following Chelsea's huge outlay in the transfer market, but he will hope the manner of this performance and the advance into the latter stages of Europe's elite competition will deliver a measure of calm and stability to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea fully deserved their win, although they squandered several big opportunities before Raheem Sterling made the breakthrough after 43 minutes, firing past Dortmund keeper Alexander Meyer after initially fluffing his shot. The goal which settled the tie and overturned Dortmund's 1-0 advantage from the first leg came in contentious fashion from the penalty spot eight minutes after the break. Dortmund were furious when a VAR review penalised Marius Wolf for handball from Ben Chilwell's cross and their sense of injustice heightened after Kai Havertz struck the post with his spot-kick only for a re-take to be ordered. This time Havertz made no mistake and Chelsea were on their way into the last eight. Speaking after the game, Potter said: ""The players were tremendous and the supporters were tremendous.""We had to be against a team that were doing so well. Over the two games I felt that we deserved to go through. It was a special night.""Follow Tuesday's Champions League actionLatest Chelsea news, analysis and fan viewsGet Chelsea news notificationsChelsea 2-0 Borussia Dortmund: Blues manager Graham Potter delighted by victoryIs this lift-off for Potter?Potter was been waiting for a show of strength such as this from the moment he left Brighton to take over at Chelsea, succeeding Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel.Potter has struggled to convince Chelsea's fans he has the personality required to take on this occasionally dysfunctional football beast and his cause has not been helped by poor Premier League form and a battle to establish any sort of shape and stability from the influx of players assembled at vast expense by new owner Todd Boehly.The pressure was released somewhat with Saturday's narrow win over Leeds United at Stamford Bridge but a big Champions League win against opponents of such European pedigree as Borussia Dortmund will go some way to convincing the doubters that Potter is cut out for the task.There is still much work to do as Chelsea lie in a wholly unacceptable 10th place in the Premier League and two victories will not change the landscape instantly but there is no doubt Stamford Bridge felt like a much happier place when Dutch referee Danny Makkelie sounded his final whistle.Potter will have been satisfied to see big performances from fit-again Reece James with Ben Chilwell also outstanding. And his former Brighton player Marc Cucurella also looked much more at home than he has before.The scenes at the final whistle were a sharp contrast to many witnessed at Stamford Bridge this season with Potter punching the air in front of joyous Chelsea supporters as their Champions League journey continues.Potter added: ""To win a game and go into the last eight of the Champions League, it's up there with one of the games or evenings of my career. ""I watched the first penalty and it didn't work so well. I can't do anything. It's down to Kai and his talent and testament and that's at the top level.""Subdued Bellingham still shows class Bellingham (centre) has scored 10 goals in all competitions for Dortmund this seasonAll eyes were England teenager Jude Bellingham from the moment he arrived at Stamford Bridge, with waiting Chelsea fans making an instant sales pitch for the young star, who is expected to be pursued by every big club in Europe this summer. This was not Bellingham's best night as Dortmund's Champions League campaign came to an end with the added disappointment of squandering a first-leg lead, but the 19-year-old still showed why he will be in such demand. Bellingham's night had low points, such as when he poked a great chance wide from eight yards in the second half and a very poor challenge in the closing seconds that left Reece James prostrate and brought a yellow card. He did, however, show class and arrogance on the ball, vision, and a marauding style as Dortmund chased an equaliser in vain after Chelsea grabbed control. Bellingham trooped off at the final whistle and is likely to be playing his Champions League football elsewhere next season, but in little flashes he still showed what all the fuss is about.

39,Sheffield United 3-2 Blackburn Rovers: Tommy Doyle scores winner as Blades reach semi-finals,SUN 19 Mar 2023,fa-cup,"FA Cup highlights: Doyle stunner sees Blades edge Blackburn in FA CupTommy Doyle struck a stoppage-time winner to send Sheffield United into the FA Cup semi-finals as they got the better of fellow Championship side Blackburn Rovers in a breathless encounter.Rovers went ahead on 21 minutes through Ben Brereton Diaz's penalty, awarded following a VAR check after Jack Robinson's handball.But the lead was short-lived as the Blades equalised eight minutes later with a large chunk of fortune, Max Lowe's long-range shot deflecting in off visiting striker Sam Gallagher.Sammie Szmodics put Rovers back in front on the hour before Oli McBurnie equalised in the 81st minute to set up an exciting finale, crowned by on-loan Manchester City midfielder Doyle's excellent long-range drive.Victory means Sheffield United are into the semi-finals for the first time since 2014, when they ended up losing 5-3 to Hull, and will face Manchester City at Wembley. However, Doyle and team-mate Jamie McAtee will not be allowed to play against City because loan players cannot face their parent clubs. ""It's an unbelievable feeling, getting the goal at the end and celebrating in front of the fans who were unbelievable - it's a special feeling,"" Doyle told BBC Radio Sheffield.""It sat up lovely for me - I just touched it and thought, with the state of the game and how things were going, 'I'm going to hit it' and thankfully it flew into the top corner.""It could be a memorable season for the Yorkshire side, who are second in the Championship and chasing a return to the Premier League.""As players you want to step up in big moments - I say that to myself all the time, to try and step up and be counted, and thankfully today I did that and to be fair so did the lads,"" added Doyle.""We know that when we step up to the plate not many teams can live with us, and we needed to find another level at the end.""While it was a euphoric finish for the Blades, it was heartbreaking for a Blackburn side who were looking to make it into their first semi-final since 2007 - and make a debut appearance at the new Wembley - though they remain in good shape for a play-off place in the second tier.A topsy-turvy tieJon Dahl Tomasson's side had looked comfortable heading into the final 10 minutes but, when McBurnie's leveller went in, the hosts seized the initiative and with the crowd behind them, made it a fantastic finale that will live long in the memory of the Bramall Lane faithful. Blackburn made a fast start to the game with Ryan Hedges finding top scorer Brereton Diaz on the edge of the box within the opening minute, but the striker could not quite get his shot away before being dispossessed.The hosts weathered the early storm and James McAtee had a golden opportunity to put his side in front after eight minutes when he was put through on goal, but in the end it was a tame effort at Rovers goalkeeper Aynsley Pears. Rovers then went up the other end to launch the attack that would lead to the opening goal, as Tyler Morton crossed for Gallagher and his shot on goal was blocked by Robinson's arm. Referee Tim Robinson did not initially give the spot-kick but was asked to consult the video monitor by VAR, and he awarded the penalty which Brereton Diaz despatched confidently.Chile striker Brereton Diaz's goal was his 14th of the season for BlackburnThe Blades' equaliser came from a lucky break as Blackburn cleared a corner which came to Max Lowe about 25 yards out, and the defender's shot was heading off-target before Gallagher stuck out a knee trying to make a block - only to see it spin away into the net. The hosts created two good openings within minutes of the restart but McAtee's heavy touch passed-up a good chance in the box before George Baldock hit the side-netting. At the other end, Wes Foderingham was then forced into a fine double save, first diving low to his left to deny Harry Pickering and then pushing out Brereton Diaz's follow-up.McAtee then missed another big chance shortly before the hour as he seized on Lewis Travis' loose pass to go one-on-one with Pears, with the goalkeeper poking out a boot to deny him again. Szmodics showed him how it was done moments later when Morton won the ball back in midfield and found Gallagher, who slipped the midfielder in and he finished expertly, shooting across Foderingham into the corner.Rovers were a whisker away from a third with 20 minutes remaining as Ryan Hedges' well-struck left-foot shot beat Foderingham, only to hit the inside of the post and roll across the goalmouth. The hosts had looked to be struggling to find an equaliser but were back on level terms with 10 minutes left when McBurnie collected Lowe's pass before turning past two defenders and finishing low past Pears. The goal changed the momentum completely and the hosts poured forward in search of the winner, which when it came was a strike of real quality, as Doyle steadied himself before unleashing a rocket which Pears could only tip further into the top corner.FA Cup: All the angles of Doyle's 'magnificent strike'Play should have stopped before winner - TomassonSpeaking after the match, Blackburn boss Tomasson said play should have been stopped before Doyle's winner as Morton was down with an eye injury.""The head injury for Morton, they say it was only a finger in the eye, but he would have been standing in that zone where the goal came from. Imagine if it was something really serious,"" he said.""I said to the referee, 'Normally, you stop a game with a head injury'. I think he knows it. It's OK.""Of course it should have been stopped, that's the rules, isn't it? It's a big moment, imagine if there is something really dangerous. You can't run when you can't see out of your eye.""The former Denmark striker was otherwise full of admiration for his side's efforts.""I feel proud, but bitterly disappointed to lose the game,"" he told BBC Radio Lancashire.

The 18-year-old Republic of Ireland striker stretched to bring down Alexis Mac Allister's clipped pass with his left foot, set himself and then stroked the ball into the bottom corner.Ferguson burst through to score his second on 70 minutes, Solly March made it four with a diving header and Kaoru Mitoma's deflected 90th-minute strike crept in at the near post to complete the scoring.Sign up for Brighton news notificationsFA Cup: Evan Ferguson stars in Brighton victoryGrimsby had knocked out five teams from divisions above them to reach their first FA Cup quarter-final for 84 years but for all their defensive discipline in the first half, the League Two side's attacking threat was extremely limited.Brighton keeper Robert Sanchez nearly gave them a way into the game when he appeared to pick the ball up outside his area under pressure, but a VAR check concluded that the ball was just on the line when he did so.Substitute John McAtee had Grimsby's two chances of note, trying to lift the first over Sanchez and seeing the second pushed around the post by the Spaniard in the closing stages.While the margin of victory could have been greater, with Mitoma missing a gilt-edged chance and Adam Webster hitting the bar, the Seagulls can now look forward to a trip to Wembley and a first semi-final - against Manchester United - since 2019.Follow Brighton v Grimsby and all of Sunday's FA Cup actionBrighton's dream season continuesA magnificent season for Brighton goes on as they cruise into the last four of the FA Cup.It was a typically stylish performance from De Zerbi's side and yet, in the first half in particular, it was clear that they have more to offer.FA Cup: Solly March scores sensational diving header for BrightonAgainst a Grimsby team three divisions below them, they were able to play within themselves, biding their time before spotting an opening and bursting into life with two or three short, sharp passes to cut through the defence.""By this display, this Brighton side are in full flow.

An already memorable campaign could become a historic one.'Ferguson is a superstar'Although March and Mitoma were on target again and provided a constant threat down the flanks, it was Ferguson's performance that really stood out.For long parts of the game, it was an understated showing from the striker, who was not often directly involved in build-up phase play, but created space for others with his movement.However, in front of goal, he was clinical, with his first goal showcasing the finish and technique that have seen him shine in this exciting Brighton team.""This kid is a superstar. Honestly,"" said BBC pundit Danny Murphy. ""He's got great feet, technical ability. He's calm, powerful and plays the role really well. You don't see him out wide, he stays central and is always a target.""I can't see a weakness in his game at the moment.

""Credit to the lads, they've been good to me and have encouraged me when I've played.""Kelly added: ""Ferguson has gone from being a player on the periphery to leading the line for Brighton.

Once he did, Willian was dismissed as well.

After that, it was mayhem.United making it hard for themselvesWe can never know what would have happened if Fulham had not suffered such a disastrous couple of minutes.It is beyond question, however, that up to that point, United were poor.Maybe their increasing number of below-par performances is a duel consequence of an arduous post-World Cup fixture schedule in which they have played 13 successive midweek matches (with a minimum of four more to come after the international break) plus a growing number of injuries and suspensions.The continued injury-enforced absences of Christian Eriksen and Anthony Martial has put increased pressure on others to perform. One who has risen to the challenge is Casemiro, but on Sunday the Brazilian was serving the first game of a four-match ban for his second dismissal in a matter of weeks.It is to their credit, therefore, that they keep managing to find a way to win quite so often.Fernandes, in particular, drives United on from central positions and Shaw has returned to form after a difficult few games.However, without De Gea, they may have been out.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64984201

""He will get better - he has the right coach and the right mindset. ""I have played against the greats. They are part of a special elite. The very best find it difficult to stop these guys. They keep finding a way. He looks like a superstar who is willing to improve and that is exciting to see. The goalscoring record puts you in a certain bracket - it is the hardest part of the game.""It will be City's sixth semi-final appearance in seven seasons under Pep Guardiola, and on this form few will argue against them lifting the trophy for only the second time in that period as they retain hopes of completing the Treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League.The draw for the FA Cup semi-finals takes place on Sunday following Brighton's tie against Grimsby Town (14:15 GMT), live on BBC One.Football Daily podcast: Conte's rant, Leeds a-leaping & another Haaland hat-trickHaaland the goalscoring machineUnstoppable Haaland lives and breathes goals - ShearerHaaland now has an incredible six hat-tricks in his debut season in English football - already half as many as brilliant Argentine Sergio Aguero scored in his ten-year City career.Considering City would play another 18 games if they reach both the FA Cup and Champions League finals, it is not beyond the realms of possibility the Norwegian will finish the campaign with about 60 goals, which has never come close to being achieved in modern times.The problem for defences is he has so many attributes.""Haaland is a beast,"" said Premier League record goalscorer Alan Shearer on Match of the Day. ""He is a goalscoring machine. He lives and breathes goals.""If he doesn't score he doesn't sleep at night. He wants another one, then another one, then another one.""He's fantastic, and this team must be a dream with the chances they create. He might get 50 goals, maybe even 60. It's bonkers.""Reaction from Manchester City's win over BurnleySign up for Man City news notificationsHis first goal owed much to his strength as goalkeeper Stefan Ortega lofted a long ball downfield. Haaland had the strength to hold off Ameen Al-Dakhil, then steered the ball back to Julian Alvarez who delivered a superb pass through the Burnley defence. Clarets keeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell left his line believing he could get to the ball first.He soon discovered Haaland is also exceptionally quick. The Norwegian beat him to it and prodded a first-time effort under the keeper.Three minutes later Haaland had his second.This time, Phil Foden delivered a low cross, which the Norwegian had the intelligence to lift over Peacock-Farrell into the net.His hat-trick goal was about being in the right place at the right time as Foden's shot bounced back off the post as Haaland lengthened his stride to apply a first-time finish.If there is a complaint, it is that Haaland is scoring too quickly. For the second game running Guardiola took him off with just over an hour played.""This guy will have a problem in the future - every game he will be expected to score three or four goals and this is not going to happen,"" said Guardiola. ""He doesn't care because he is so positive, so optimistic, never complains. The target numbers, I don't know. But if we play good, Erling will score goals.""'Verging on the ridiculous' - Haaland's FA Cup hat-trickKompany's welcome returnLosing at Manchester City is not a new experience for Burnley - they have never won at Etihad Stadium and their last victory at Maine Road came in 1963.For Kompany it must have been a strange experience, given he enjoyed so many memorable moments here and even has a statue outside the ground.He received a standing ovation when his name was read out before kick-off, with even Guardiola joining the applause.Once the whistle went, Kompany, in his distinctive cap ordered, cajoled and encouraged his team.He showed flashes of irritation when attacking moves were not carried out to his satisfaction, but he also offered praise when Burnley threatened, which they did sporadically, especially in the period before Haaland scored the opener.At the end Kompany shook hands with all the City players who were his team-mates not that long ago.He stood with fellow Belgian Kevin de Bruyne for a quiet word, possibly congratulating him for the superb pass that released Alvarez for his second, having already laid his first on a plate with a precise cross.Kompany knows his side come up against nothing like that quality in the Championship, but it does seem likely he will be back next season - when he hopes some harsh lessons from today will have been learned.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64984170

That allowed the space for Benrahma to exploit and score, with a video assistant referee (VAR) confirming Tomas Soucek had kept the ball in play.United thought they had equalised through Casemiro's header - only for it to be ruled out for offside after a VAR check.But the home side did manage to equalise in the 77th minute when Nayef Aguerd, under pressure from Wout Weghorst, headed into his own net from Bruno Fernandes' excellent corner.However, Garnacho, who also scored a last-minute winner in United's 2-1 win over Fulham in November, was the Old Trafford hero with a fine finish to put his side ahead.

And United, who only just scraped into the Europa League by finishing sixth last season, are still fighting for every trophy in 2022-23.The 12-time FA Cup winners are also in the last 16 of the Europa League and third in the Premier League, although 11 points behind leaders Arsenal after the Gunners thrashed Everton 4-0 on Wednesday.

Marcel Sabitzer nearly scored his first goal following his loan move from Bayern Munich, but was denied by Areola's excellent low save.But West Ham, 16th in the Premier League and two points clear of the bottom three, were the better side for the rest of the first half. Michail Antonio missed a great chance when he raced onto Benrahma's excellent through-ball, but De Gea made a crucial save.The Spanish keeper, presented with an award by former boss Sir Alex Ferguson before the game after his 181st club clean sheet in the win over Newcastle broke Peter Schmeichel's record, was in excellent form as he also denied the impressive Benrahma and cut out Antonio's dangerous cross.Ten Hag had to do something at the break and brought on Casemiro, who had been named in the Fifpro World Team of the Year for 2022 and scored the opening goal at Wembley.The Brazilian nearly made an instant impact as he played in Weghorst, who fired over the top.West Ham then took the lead with Benrahma's 54th-minute goal - and that proved the instant signal for United's 25-goal top scorer Marcus Rashford to come off the bench.FA Cup 2023: 'Massive performance' from Man UtdDavid Moyes' side had chances to double their advantage but Pablo Fornals and Antonio failed to take two of them, before the hosts piled on the pressure.Casemiro headed in from a Fernandes free-kick, only for it to be ruled out, but another set-piece from the Portuguese international set up the own-goal equaliser.West Ham were hoping to hang on for extra time, but Garnacho's curled finish, followed by Fred's goal in the fifth minute of added time ended their hopes.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64799759

Even in defeat in Kazakhstan; in incessant matches with Israel; in a 1-0 humbling by Costa Rica; in a last-gasp Harry Kane equaliser; and also in getting to a major championships for the first time in a generation only to have your goalie lobbed from the half-way line.A top-10 side in Croatia were undone here 10 years ago, but surely not since World Cup finalists France were heroically beaten in 2006 and 2007 has that loyalty been vindicated as it was at a national stadium dripping with drama as much as the damp Glaswegian weather.Clarke steered Scotland to Euro 2020, but in terms of landmark nights, this one is up there with dumping Denmark and shootouts in Serbia. And then some.From the seventh minute, Scotland were on the march. Pedro Porro, Spurs' beleaguered full-back, slipped, leaving the door open for Andy Robertson to pounce. His cut back was perfect for McTominay, whose low rifled shot whizzed off the sprawling Inigo Martinez and into the net.If that was met with hysteria, you could have heard a pin drop when Scotland's new hero struck again on the 51st minute. This time it was Kieran Tierney's cross after a marauding run that the Spaniards didn't deal with. Fifty thousand held their collective breath as the leather of McTominay's boot struck on the half volley.Bedlam ensued in the stands, while Clarke allowed himself a modest fist pump in a fleeting glimpse of emotion.In truth, it was a killer blow that caused Spain - who made eight changes from the side which overcame Norway 3-0 on Saturday - to capitulate. Passes all over the place, 50/50s lost. They were a shadow of the team that had the Scots clinging to a half-time lead. Their second defeat in 39 European Championship qualifiers was in the post.While Ryan Christie's meandering run and toe poke whistled past for what would have been a quick second, Espanyol's Joseulu soon caused chaos. He had a free header straight at Angus Gunn saved, before then thundering another off a rattled crossbar.There was then a moment of madness from Robertson, who was lucky to escape a shoulder to Porro's jaw. It was a bombardment at that point. But Scotland should have added to their lot, too. Lyndon Dykes steered over when one-on-one just before the break, while John McGinn whacked the bar straight from a free-kick.In the end it did not matter. The game came to a close with a chorus of ""no Scotland, no party"". It may be going for some time.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65022207

But while the Paris St-Germain superstar showed flashes of quality, he was upstaged by Bayern Munich right-back Pavard, who slammed a rasping shot in off the underside of Bazunu's crossbar after cutting out Cullen's attempted pass to Jason Knight.Pavard's goal came after a first half in which France struggled to break down a stubborn home defence and the visitors were further troubled by a spirited Irish side in the closing stages when they had AC Milan goalkeeper Maignan to thank for the win. The 27-year-old tipped a deflected James McClean effort around the post for a corner and displayed impressive reflexes to stop Jules Kounde heading into his own goal. But Maignan saved his best for last as at full stretch he got a strong right hand to Collins' top corner-bound header, with the Republic defender's anguish etched on his face as he collapsed to the turf at the full-time whistle. Given how his side pressed for a goal during a gripping conclusion to the game, Republic boss Stephen Kenny will be disappointed to come away empty-handed but can draw encouragement after watching his players unnerve the team ranked third in the world. The Irish will now turn their attention to June's two-match window, with Gibraltar to visit Dublin after the Republic's trip to Greece, as they attempt to qualify for their first tournament since Euro 2016.

53,England 2-0 Ukraine: Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka score in comfortable win,SUN 26 Mar 2023,european-championship-qualifying,"England have won both of their Euro 2024 qualifiers so farEngland maintained their winning start to Euro 2024 qualifying with a comfortable victory over Ukraine at Wembley. Gareth Southgate's side built on the foundation of their first away win against Italy since 1961 with an efficient performance that was more than enough to see off the visitors. England struggled to build any momentum until record scorer Harry Kane made it 55 international goals when he bundled in Bukayo Saka's cross at the far post eight minutes before half-time. The second arrived three minutes later and was all Saka's own work, the Arsenal winger turning away from his man on the edge of the area and curling a superb effort beyond the reach of Anatoliy Trubin and into the top corner. Leicester City's James Maddison made a good impression on his first England start while Brentford's Ivan Toney won his first cap as a late substitute, captain Kane making way once there was never any serious danger of a Ukrainian comeback. Football Daily podcast: England beat Ukraine as Maddison makes 'second debut'Reaction as England beat UkraineSaka a special talent Saka is part of England's young generation that Southgate hopes will form a key component of their Euro 2024 campaign and the quest to finally claim a major trophy - and what a talent he is. Saka has been outstanding as Arsenal lead the Premier League table and after a fine World Cup in Qatar he has simply carried on the form he has been showing all season. He was a constant danger down England's right flank and the 21-year-old merely confirmed what he is showing on an almost weekly basis, namely that he has a golden future ahead of him. Saka's cross unlocked a well-organised Ukraine defence for Kane to pounce and set England on their way before producing a superb piece of individual skill to effectively end the contest. England's ideal start Gareth Southgate's side has scored four goals and conceded just one in their two Euro 2024 games so farEngland manager Southgate could not have hoped for a better start to these qualifiers as two of arguably their more testing fixtures have resulted in maximum points. And he will be happy with portions of England's performances in both games, particularly the first half against Italy in Naples and the manner in which they closed this game out with the minimum of fuss. England are the favourites to qualify at the top of their group and secure a place at the Euros in Germany, where they will be among those touted as potential winners, and these opening two games have certainly justified that status. They survived a poor second half in Italy and a drab first half-hour here but the end results certainly count as a job well done. ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65004815

56,Euro 2024 qualifiers: Northern Ireland 0-1 Finland - Hosts rue disallowed goal in defeat,SUN 26 Mar 2023,european-championship-qualifying,"Finland and Northern Ireland both now have three Euro qualifying pointsNorthern Ireland were left to rue missed chances and a disallowed goal as Finland delivered an early blow to their Euro 2024 qualification hopes with victory in Belfast.A scrappy first-half goal from Benjamin Kallman gave the visitors their first Group H points. Dion Charles' close-range finish early in the second half was disallowed for handball soon after substitute Josh Magennis had blazed over.NI beat San Marino 2-0 in their opener.The win in San Marino had added to the positivity that had engulfed the camp since Michael O'Neill was appointed for a second spell in charge.They went into his first game back at Windsor Park in an upbeat mood.A 17,900 home crowd gave the side and manager great vocal backing throughout the game despite the hosts producing a performance that looked disjointed at times and relied on the surging running power of teenager Conor Bradley to provide an attacking threat.Conor Bradley impressed for Northern IrelandAn inability to score goals has long been a problem for the side, even for parts of O'Neill's successful first reign, and proved costly against a team who lost 3-1 to top seeds Denmark in their group opener on Thursday.Reaction as Finland beat Northern Ireland in qualifyingEarlier on Sunday, the Danes suffered a surprise defeat by Kazakhstan which meant Slovenia top the group after seeing off San Marino, the world's bottom-ranked side. Finland's opening goal came from an attack down the right that saw Robin Lod turn Jamal Lewis and Jordan Thompson superbly before delivering a low cross that fell to Norwich City striker Teemu Pukki.His miscued shot fell to Kallman at the back post who prodded past Bailey Peacock-Farrell in front of The Kop to give the visitors a lead that came when the hosts were enjoying their best spell of the match.Northern Ireland thought they had equalised on 63 minutes when Charles found the net with a close-range finish after a corner had fallen to him.But referee Ivan Kruzliak ruled he had initially controlled the ball with his hand, not his chest, and a VAR check confirmed the decision.Watch: 'Disappointed' O'Neill believes NI can 'make up points'It was the fourth huge chance of the game that Northern Ireland created, with their first as early as the seventh minute when a Thompson pull-back from the byeline fell just behind Conor Washington, who was ready to pounce yards from goal. The Kop had immediately started getting behind their team after they conceded and the players almost gave them the response they wanted when Dion Charles got on the end of a fine move and came desperately close to equalising just before the break.More composed play from Shea Charles saw him release Bradley on the right who surged forward purposely before finding Charles with a perfectly-weight pass, but the Bolton striker's shot on the turn was smothered well by keeper and captain Lukas Hradecky, who may have been more troubled if Charles had managed to get some elevation on his effort Magennis was introduced from the bench early in the second half in a bold substitution from O'Neill that saw the Wigan striker come for injured centre-half Daniel Ballard, with a change of shape meaning Northern Ireland switched from a 3-5-2 to a 4-3-3, with Washing and Dion Charles playing either side of Magennis in a front three.Within minutes of coming on, Magennis blazed an excellent chance over the crossbar after Bradley headed back across goal from a left-wing cross. The disallowed goal on 63 minutes was as close as Northern Ireland came to finding an equaliser as they began to look ragged as the match wore in, with substitutes George Saville and Gavin Whyte unable to have the impact O'Neill would have hoped for.Defeat leaves Northern Ireland fifth in Group H, one of four teams on three points after the first two rounds of fixtures, ahead of June's double-header away to Denmark and at home to Kazakhstan.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65004814

And the Manchester United midfielder added his second moments later.Steve Clarke had billed it as a must-win game against Group A's lowest seeds, who ended the game with 10 men after a late red card for Nicholas Ioannou, and it was job done in that sense.But the Scotland head coach will know that, despite their first winning start to a Euro qualifying campaign since 2006, improvement will be needed as top seeds Spain visit on Tuesday.Lessons as Scots and Spain start with 3-0 winsJoselu debut double helps down NorwayReaction and as it happenedThe dawn of new qualifying campaign brought the Tartan Army to Hampden full of optimism. They were rewarded with a dominant first-half performance during which they were rarely under threat and probed at the Cypriot defensive wall with consistency and determination. All that was lacking was a little more cutting edge in the vital area - directly in front of goal. That was a theme until late on, with the result still uncertain until McTominay stepped up.Scotland's intent was clear. Get at Cyprus down the flanks, particularly the left. That pattern was fairly consistent, but the first real threat came down the other side when Aaron Hickey danced into the box and, from the tightest of angles, forced goalkeeper Demetris Demetriou into a low save at his post. Clarke's side were cruising, comfortable on the ball and showing an impressive level of composure. The left flank proved the route to the crucial opening goal as Stuart Armstrong fed Andy Robertson, who timed his run perfectly to stay marginally onside and cross first time. The ball deflected perfectly into McGinn's path as he instinctively raced to meet it and finish from close range to take his Scotland tally to one more than the talismanic James McFadden. Che Adams came close after super interplay with McGinn, but his shot was tipped over and the unfortunate striker left the field early in the second half with a worrying looking injury. The second half show dipped significantly and the creeping doubt began to emerge that Cyprus might just nick something.Finally, though, Scotland got there - thanks to three of their own substitutes. Ryan Christie did superbly to win possession and fire in a cross ,Lyndon Dykes nodded it on and McTominay raced onto it to half-volley home. An enormous cheer and accompanying sigh of relief engulfed Hampden before McTominay capitalised again when Robertson laid the ball into his path and he calmly dispatched it home with ease.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64997970

Kane wrote his name into the history books in the 44th minute when he beat Gianluigi Donnarumma from the penalty spot for his 54th goal, overtaking previous record holder Wayne Rooney. Declan Rice gave England an early lead when he scored from close range after Kane's shot was blocked before the captain put memories of his penalty miss against France in the World Cup quarter-final in Qatar aside with an emphatic spot-kick. Italy, whistled off at half-time in their first international in Naples for a decade, improved as England became sloppy. Debutant Mateo Retegui was the beneficiary of poor work from Harry Maguire, whose failed attempt to close down the danger on the edge of the box allowed the Italians to shift the ball to the 23-year-old to drill an unerring finish past Jordan Pickford after 56 minutes. England's drop in performance was compounded by Luke Shaw's second yellow card with 10 minutes left but they hung on for a vital win.

The only blot was a dreadful miss by Jack Grealish that would have made it 3-0 and surely avoided the anxious second-half showing that followed.Italy were still in the hunt, just, and after what would surely have been some choice half-time words from coach Roberto Mancini they came out fighting in the second half. Their cause was helped by an England performance barely recognisable from the first half, the visitors conceding control as well as the goal that set up a tense finish. Shaw's dismissal did little to help England's cause late on. The defender picked up the first of his two yellow cards in the 78th minute for time-wasting when preparing to take a throw-in and the second came just two minutes later for a mis-timed challenged on Retegui.Italy, however, lacked the quality to make England pay the price and in the end their Euro 2024 campaign got off to the ideal start. England now have the chance to build on these three points when they face Ukraine at Wembley on Sunday. England win in subdued NaplesThe theory was that Italy's football authorities chose the ramshackle but hugely atmospheric Stadio Diego Armando Maradona to make life uncomfortable for England. In practice, there were empty seats inside this vast bowl and Italy's poor first half meant that it took until after the break for the home support to come to life. It had been suggested Napoli's fans struggle to form an attachment with the Italy team and their silence throughout the first half and reaction at half-time suggested they could hardly wait to get back to throwing their passion and fire behind their own team as they run away with Serie A and chase the Champions League. The subdued mood played into England's hands, Gareth Southgate's side only making life difficult for themselves with their own indifferent showing that almost allowed Italy back in.

The Finns lost away to top seeds Denmark in Wednesday evening's other Group H encounter, while Slovenia had earlier opened the group with a 2-1 away win over Kazakhstan  A chorus of 'We love you Michael, we do' belted out from the ever-vocal 1,000-strong Northern Ireland travelling support as they welcomed back the manager who led them to the Euro 2016 finals during his successful first tenure that ended abruptly in 2020 due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.Having won just four times in 24 competitive matches under Ian Baraclough since then, San Marino provided inviting opponents for O'Neill's return as they are now without a win in all of their 167 competitive outings and sitting in 211th in the Fifa rankings. Youngsters Shea Charles and Conor Bradley both delivered hugely mature and impressive performances for Northern Ireland, while Everton youngster Isaac Price joined Cameron McGeehan in making a senior international debut in the second half.'No ceiling point' for young players - Michael O'NeillCharles rewards O'Neill with doubleCharles' opener arrived in the 24th minute and it was a finish applied with the swagger and technique of a man high in confidence in front of goal, having scored 18 times for Bolton Wanderers so far this season.Man City teenager Shea Charles, who looked composed throughout while deputising for injured captain Steven Davis in the deep-lying midfield role - found the ever-willing Conor Washington with a fine pass into the right channel and he delivered an excellent first-time low cross for his strike partner.Charles had to watch closely as the ball bounced before arriving at him at the back post before controlling the finish superbly to open his account for Northern Ireland on his 14th cap.Charles headed home his second 10 minutes after the break, once again being in the right place at the right time to meet an excellent Jamal Lewis cross from the left with a close-range header that seemed to wrong-foot Benedettini who got an outstretched hand on the ball but could not keep it out. Charles happy to reward O'Neill's faith in San MarinoIt led to choruses of 'Dion's on fire' - a twist on an old favourite that many will no doubt remember from the Euro 2016 finals - and proved definitively how important it is for an international team to have a striker scoring goals regularly at club level. Charles' opening goal was very timely for the visiting team, who until then had been well on top but were frustrated as a number of set-piece moves failed to come off while a few players seemed to have problems staying up as they slipped to the ground.Paddy McNair had the only significant chance before the first goal came - apart from a scare from the hosts when Filippo Berardi went through and forced a save from Bailey Peacock-Farrell before being flagged offside - but his downward back-post header from a George Saville cross was well saved by goalkeeper Elia Benedettini. The nerve-settling effect of taking the lead was clearly visible as O'Neill's men began creating a number of good chances, with Saville blazing over from a fine Bradley cross and Dion Charles just not able to stretch far enough to prod home a beautiful, inviting cross from his namesake Shea.However, the best chance for Northern Ireland to double their lead fell to wing-back Lewis just before the break but the Newcastle United man unsuccessfully attempted to turn Dion Charles' perfect cross on to his left foot, when he looked set to shoot with his right in front of goal.The second half somewhat petered out during the final half hour, though there was a scare for Northern Ireland when Nicola Nanni went through and scored for the visitors in the 67th minute, but the flag went up for offside once his shot found the net.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64972898

Vladislavs Gutkovskis had spurned a golden chance after racing in behind the home defence, but Stephen Kenny's were eventually punished when Uldrikis' 25-yard screamer flew past helpless Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher and into the top corner.The home crowd were temporarily silenced by the Latvian goal, but they were stunned in first-half injury time when Zjuzins' low effort flew off the soaking turf, took a deflection off Nathan Collins and, to compound the Republic's misery, took a touch off Kelleher en route to the top corner.Ogbene makes instant impactThe intorductions of Chiedozie Ogbene and Mikey Johnston changed the game for the Republic of IrelandLatvia almost took the lead less than a minute into the second half when Gutkovskis fired over when well placed.Ferguson, still brimming with confidence despite the Latvian fightback, fired narrowly over from 25 yards and Uldrikis attempted to repeat his first-half effort but Kelleher was equal to it.Mikey Johnston, who changed allegiance from Scotland, was introduced for his debut in the second half along with Ogbene in the 64th minute and the substitutes made an immediate impact.Johnston struck the post after a driving run at the Latvian defence 45 seconds after coming on and Ogbene reacted quickest to tap into the unguarded net.Tiring after taking a couple of knocks, Ferguson was given a standing ovation as he was replaced by Troy Parrott with 18 minutes to play.Johnston introduced himself to the Irish support with a lively performance and he almost capped with a goal after some mesmerising footwork but his effort was well blocked by the scrambling Latvian defence.While there were positives in the win - most notably Ferguson, Smallbone and Johnston - manager Kenny knows his side will have to improve as World Cup finalists France travel to Dublin on Monday in the Republic's opening Euro 2024 qualifier.The Irish are underdogs to reach the finals with the Netherlands, Greece and minnows Gibraltar to come in Group B.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65029434

Only Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead have done so more often in English top-flight games than the 22-year-old England international.City looked every inch a side which have not lost in 90 minutes since 25 September, and must now be considered a serious contender for the WSL title.They could even afford for WSL top scorer Khadija Shaw - watched from the stands by fellow Jamaican star Usain Bolt - to have a rare off day.Bright absence leaves Chelsea in the darkAs good as City were, Chelsea were far below their best, and manager Emma Hayes did not even wait until half-time before making her first changes.Lauren James and Sophie Ingle were hooked before the interval, and Chelsea were sent out several minutes early from their break.In defence Chelsea were unusually shaky, clearly missing Millie Bright who was absent after picking up an injury during their midweek Champions League quarter-final first-leg win over defending champions Lyon.Hayes said Bright should be back in time to face the French side for next week's second leg. She cannot get the England central defender back again soon enough.Going forward, Chelsea were limited to playing long balls over the top for Sam Kerr to chase, which City comfortably dealt with after cutting off the supply from midfield.Kerr, currently on 49 WSL goals, had few chances, firing straight at Ellie Roebuck early on before being denied from a tight angle by the City keeper in the second half.Chelsea improved after the break, however their best chance of the whole game came in injury time, Melanie Leupolz volleying over from 12 yards.Hayes was also given another worry when Erin Cuthbert limped off with an injury in the second half, leaving the Scottish midfielder a doubt for the second leg against Lyon.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65004828
69,Aston Villa Women 5-0 Leicester City Women: Rachel Daly double helps Villa thrash Foxes,SUN 26 Mar 2023,womens-super-league,"WSL highlights: Aston Villa 5-0 Leicester CityEngland forward Rachel Daly and Alisha Lehmann both struck twice as clinical Aston Villa put the Women's Super League's bottom side Leicester to the sword at Villa Park. In front of a lively crowd of 6,489 - just shy of Villa's record attendance for a women's game - Daly took her tally for the season to 13 WSL goals, just two behind the league's top scorer, Manchester City's Khadija Shaw. Kenza Dali found the bottom corner from 20 yards to put Villa ahead and Lehmann produced a controlled first-time finish from Kirsty Hanson's low cross to double the lead. Daly then continued her bid for the WSL's Golden Boot as she robbed Sophie Howard to roll home Villa's third and, after the interval, steered Lehmann's inviting low centre beyond Janina Leitzig. She then turned provider for Villa's fifth with a clever reverse pass that freed Maz Pacheco to cross for Lehmann to bundle home her second as the fifth-placed hosts registered a fourth straight WSL win. The margin of defeat was harsh on Leicester but the WSL's lowest scorers were made to pay for a wasteful first half in which they spurned several chances, with the loss leaving them two points from safety. Relive Sunday's Women's Super League matchesVilla's superb season shows no signs of slowing While Villa fell just a few hundred short of a record crowd on the terraces on Women's Football Weekend, they certainly did not fall short on the pitch.Victory virtually assured a top-half finish in what is proving to be the most successful season in the club's history - never before have they recorded four consecutive top-flight wins. Indeed, this was a sixth straight victory in all competitions, albeit a couple have come via extra time or penalties, with Villa also having an FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea to look forward to. Daly - already Villa's highest scorer in a single season - will have other honours on her mind, with six games remaining to overhaul the WSL's leading scorer Shaw. In this form, her chances should not be discounted. She also provided a third assist of the season, for Dali's opener, and nearly added a fourth late on, crossing for teenager Georgia Mullett who almost capped a perfect day for the hosts, only for Leitzig to tip aside her header. Dali and Lehmann were rewarded with standing ovations by the boisterous home support as they came off late on and, by the end, there were almost as many goals as claret and blue foam fingers in the crowd. Feeble finishing costs Foxes Leicester manager Willie Kirk took over the struggling Foxes in November, replacing Lydia BedfordYou never have any luck when you are down the bottom, so the cliche goes, and Leicester had plenty of reason to believe it after five minutes at Villa Park. Josie Green stood up a fine cross to the far post and, although Sam Tierney's volley was well struck, Villa's England keeper Hannah Hampton produced a superb reactive save to keep it out. Then, as a scramble ensued, Tierney came back from an offside position to touch the ball before Aileen Whelan lashed it into the roof of the net. A minute later, Villa were ahead and even then Leicester could have levelled as a loose ball dropped to Hannah Cain, whose vicious strike looked destined for the net until it struck Dali flush in the back. When Ashleigh Plumptre fired straight at Hampton from 15 yards with Leicester 2-0 down, the visitors would have feared the worst and so it proved as they failed to score for the 11th time in 16 WSL matches this season. The Foxes staged a near-miraculous escape from relegation last season but, after netting just seven times in 16 matches, their fate will likely depend on huge home games against eighth-placed Liverpool and relegation rivals Reading in April.

Guro Bergsvand flicked a header goalwards and Sarri was alert to poke home.Reading had a great chance to pull a goal back when Faye Bryson's superb volley was tipped over the bar by keeper Lydia Williams.But Harries proved the difference for the hosts with two goals in 14 minutes.Captain Emma Mukandi provided the assist with a hopeful ball forward and Harries took it under control and glided through the defence to score.Lily Woodham then floated in a cross that was met by a cushioned header from Harries for the equaliser.A battling comeback will give Reading a much-needed boost after losing to Chelsea in the FA Cup last weekend.Their next fixture is a must-win game against bottom club Leicester.After this display, Harries should now be in contention to start a match that Reading cannot afford to lose if they are to keep their place in the WSL.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65004830

Little then rifled into the roof of the net to restore their two-goal advantage.Foord and Maanum then added two more as Arsenal sealed an emphatic victory.Arsenal lay down a markerArsenal have games against the rest of the top four in their remaining fixturesJonas Eidevall's side may be behind in the title race but they remain firmly in the mix for the top spot.With matches against the rest of the top four still to play, lifting the trophy is still within their sights.They bounced back in fine fashion from Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat by Bayern Munich and appeared improved by the introduction of Victoria Pelova to the starting line-up.The January signing was creative on the wing and assisted both of Foord's goals.Foord's tenacity continually posed problems for the hosts and she could be a dangerous prospect when they take on fellow challengers Manchester City next weekend.Arsenal host Bayern in the second leg of their quarter-final before that - and Eidevall believes his side's performance on Saturday was good preparation.He said: ""Hopefully we go into the game on Wednesday with a good bit of self-confidence and I think we should have that from our performances.""It is not a team who have one or two strong performances. We have built good momentum coming into these two games against Bayern Munich and City. Now it is up to us to execute it.""City, who are fourth, face second-place Chelsea on Sunday.Spurs' improvement haltedTottenham are only five points clear of the relegation spot and have played a game more than bottom club LeicesterTottenham halted their nine-game WSL losing streak with victory over Leicester City on 15 March in interim boss Vicky Jepson's first game in charge.She took the reins after Rehanne Skinner was dismissed, and this result ensures they remain among the league's relegation-threatened sides in ninth - five points ahead of bottom club Leicester and having played a game more.Spurs were strong for much of the first half against Arsenal but rapidly succumbed as the Gunners' relentless attacking became too much to handle after the break.Fellow strugglers Reading and Brighton are among their six remaining opponents, and Jepson will need to turn things around if Spurs are to stop looking over their shoulders.""When they go 3-1 up, it was probably the nail in the coffin,"" said Jepson.""Then they built momentum and we had to ride the storm. We didn't ride the storm as well as we would like to and we find ourselves 5-1 down.""It is just one of those things.

Cissoko slid in clumsily on Alessia Russo, catching the England forward as she checked back.United captain Zelem was the calmest woman in Old Trafford as she tucked the penalty away, to cheers as much of relief as of joy from the home supporters.They were further calmed 15 minutes later when second half sub Garcia broke the Hammers offside trap, controlled Toone's lofted through ball and slotted past West Ham keeper Mackenzie Arnold.United were finally calm enough to put together a flowing move for their third goal in the final 10 minutes, Ladd curling into the bottom corner from Ona Batlle's fine cut back, before Garcia got her second by tapping in the rebound after Arnold parried a shot from Martha Thomas.Galton's century marked in styleWhile there may have been annoyance at some of the refereeing decisions from United, they could only blame themselves for a lack of creativity in the opening 45 minutes which left chances at a premium.One thing United did not lack was effort up front however, primarily driven by Galton, making her 100th appearance for the club and presented with a commemorative framed shirt before the game.Galton, the fourth player to reach a United women's century after joining the club following their formation in 2018, was the one to close down Risa Shimizu to win the ball for Toone to play in Garcia for the second goal. United are often irresistible at home, scoring 53 goals in their last 15 home WSL matches with four or more strikes in nine of those fixtures, including tonight.Here they had to be a lot more patient against Paul Konchesky's side, who were hoping for a repeat of their display against Arsenal earlier this year, where they held another WSL title hopeful to a 0-0 draw.However, West Ham offered very little at the other end of the pitch, and remain winless in the WSL in 2023. Only their solid form in the first half of the season - five wins in their first 10 games - should stave off a relegation fight.

We frustrated Everton, but they put their bodies on the line. Courtney Brosnan was their best player by a country mile.""Sixth-placed Everton are now without a win in four games, while a point for Liverpool puts them eight points clear of the relegation place.Everton denied double successWhile there was a clear section of away fans in the corner of the Bullens Road Stand at Goodison Park, an eruption of noise indicated a significant number of Liverpool fans scattered around the rest of the ground when Stengel got her equaliser.Both sets of supporters mingled in the fan zone prior to the game and the atmosphere inside felt almost like a 50-50 split rather than an Everton home game.The Toffees had spoiled Liverpool's party when they beat them 3-0 at Anfield in September in what was supposed to be a celebration of their return to the WSL after a two-year absence.But Everton were unable to complete a double, despite good efforts from George and Nicoline Sorensen.Just over 5,000 last witnessed Everton women play at Goodison Park and when the Toffees attacked the Gwladys Street end in the second period, the volume increased notably.Even though there were no goals after the break, both had opportunities to take the win and neither disallowed goal was without controversy.Everton had a glorious chance to re-establish their lead when Sorensen whipped in a pinpoint accurate cross and Jess Park only had to get her header on target, but it flew wide. She buried her face in the turf knowing she should have scored.Toffees defender Megan Finnigan came to her side's rescue in a thrilling climax when Shanice van de Sanden lost her marker to set up Stengel in the penalty area.But the American's effort was blocked on the line, before Brosnan also made a fine save in the closing stages to deny Stengel again.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64985341

Willie Kirk's side missed the chance to leapfrog their opponents and stay one point behind Brighton in 11th.Relive the action from Tottenham v Leicester in the WSLWinning start for Jepson eases Spurs relegation fearsWhile Leicester were unable to create a real chance of note in the closing stages, there was understandable tension emitting from the Tottenham players and staff as they tried to cling on for a first league win since beating Brighton 8-0 on 30 October.Few could have foreseen the run that followed as Spurs plummeted from fifth to 10th and found themselves firmly in a relegation battle. Even the additions of England and Mana Iwabuchi, on loan from Arsenal, could not stop the rot.It came as little shock then when the decision was made to part ways with Skinner. The only slight surprise was that they did so just two days before such a crucial meeting with a much-improved Leicester side.Assistant manager Jepson, the former Liverpool boss, was installed as a temporary replacement. Her team's display was largely unimpressive, but they got the result they needed.Leicester were the better side in a dire first half but their own lack of cutting edge ensured Spurs' sloppiness in possession went unpunished.However, England was brought in from Chelsea to make the difference for Spurs - albeit they hoped it would be as they challenged higher up the table - and did so against Leicester to give her side a five-point cushion in the fight against the drop.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64279743

However, there was no let off the third time.Lauren James played a pinpoint ball over the top from the right touchline, Kerr timed her run to perfection, brought the ball down on her chest, then lifted it gloriously over Earps and into the far corner.Follow live updates of Sunday's WSL actionMarc Skinner's side had an opportunity to equalise almost immediately when a Chelsea slip allowed Ella Toone space in the box. But the England attacking midfielder seemed torn between going for goal and crossing, and the result was neither one nor the other as the ball sailed wide.United felt they should have had a penalty in the 33rd minute when Nikita Parris went down under contact from Kadeisha Buchanan, but referee Cheryl Foster waved played on.Kerr remained Chelsea's main threat in the second half, muscling Maya le Tissier off the ball before side-footing just wide. And while United pushed for a leveller in the closing stages, they failed to create any clear chances and the hosts held on.""We deserved it - that was a Chelsea performance,"" Hayes said.""Depleted - we have a sickness bug in the camp - we couldn't play Erin Cuthbert carrying a knock and Jelena Cankovic is carrying a knock too. ""What a tremendous squad I have and I've been saying it every week that it was time for other players to step up.""It's just a massive three points and when we came into the game, we had played two games more than Manchester United since they last kicked-off.""They played Leicester earlier last weekend, so to win like that and against a team who are top of the league is amazing for my team - fantastic effort.""Chelsea are now two points clear at the top as they bid for a sixth WSL title.Kerr quality helps Chelsea overcome injury problems'One of the goals of the season' - Kerr hits superb openerThe depth of talent available to Chelsea is no secret but with Fran Kirby, Guro Reiten, Pernille Harder, Katerina Svitkova and Erin Cuthbert all unavailable, they needed every last bit of it against United.Even in a team of stars, Kerr has often shone brightest and - like so many great players - has a knack of delivering when it matters most.In a game of few chances, Kerr was a threat throughout with her very presence seeming to unnerve a United backline that had been breached just eight times in the WSL this campaign.""Listen, she should have had a hat-trick,"" Hayes added. ""To be fair, I'll say that because that's how good she is.

Russo had not netted in the league for United since the 6-0 win over Liverpool on 15 January but a game against the league's worst defence offered a prime opportunity to add to her tally. Her movement and ruthless finishing demonstrated why title rivals Arsenal offered two world-record fees for her services in January and her form will be pivotal if United are to wrestle the title from Chelsea, who have won the WSL three times in a row.The 3-1 defeat by Chelsea in the reverse fixture in November remains United's only loss of the season and the stage is set for a potential title showdown at Kingsmeadow next weekend.It will also likely offer a more stringent examination of Mary Earps, who was named women's goalkeeper of the year at the Fifa Best Awards earlier this week but rarely tested in this game.If Chelsea win their first of two matches in hand against Brighton on Wednesday, they will cut the gap at the top to one point before hosting United.Skinner's assertion about his side's prowess is about to face the ultimate test.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64775009

The win is boss Gareth Taylor's 73rd in 100 games in charge of the club.City have won more games (10) and more points (32) since the beginning of October than any other Women's Super League side.They sought a fast start here, Shaw flashing across the face of goal, Lauren Hemp dragging wide and Chloe Kelly almost finding the bottom corner. In contrast, struggling Spurs arrived on a seven-match losing streak, the worst in their history.Any assumptions about a straightforward home win were ended when Bizet slotted the visitors into the lead midway through the first half.At that point keeper Tinja-Riikka Korpela was proving unbeatable, pulling off outstanding saves to deny Shaw (twice) and Kelly.However, WSL top scorer Shaw was not to be denied, with quickfire goals before and after half-time breaking Spurs' resistance.Her first was a header after Korpela's save was recycled back into the box and her second, a confident stroke of a penalty following Ashleigh Neville's foul on Kelly.City were generally in control but on the break, Spurs should have equalised only for Nikola Karczewska spooned over after Rosella Ayane had been brilliantly denied by Ellie Roebuck.The points were secured when Shaw broke through two challenges and fired into the roof of net for her seventh goal in two games after netting four in the FA Cup last week at Bristol City. Defeat leaves Spurs 10th in the table and nervously contemplating the improving form of sides below them.Taylor reaches 100 not out as Shaw impressesTaylor was appointed in May 2020 after managing the men's academy team and has finished second and third during his two full seasons in charge.The former City striker has designs on going one better this campaign but faces a fierce challenge from champions Chelsea and leaders Manchester United, who earlier extended their lead at the top of the Women's Super League with a 5-1 victory over Leicester.This win moves City second, above Chelsea, who now have two games in hand as a result of playing in Sunday's League Cup final.Indeed, City still have both of their main title rivals left to play, with a visit to Old Trafford scheduled for the penultimate week of the season. To remain in contention, Taylor will need similarly threatening displays from Shaw, who had 11 shots in this game, five of them on target, and moved three goals clear of Aston Villa's Rachel Daly in the race to be top scorer.The Jamaica striker is an imposing target and her lethal form proved far too much for this fragile Spurs defence.After a trip to Brighton on Sunday, 12 March, City's following two WSL games are against Chelsea and Arsenal.Taylor will know much more about his side's title credentials after those fixtures.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64775014

Kelly Chambers' side have played a game more than Leicester and Tottenham and three more than Brighton though so remain in trouble.'It's like a family' - Chambers on life at ReadingWest Ham started the game strongly with Honoka Hayashi, Amalie Threstrup and Lucy Parker all having efforts saved by the impressive Grace Moloney.Reading grew into the game with Wellings volleying a glorious chance from five yards over the bar at the end of the first half.The opening exchanges of the second half were scrappy with both sides lacking quality and confidence.The first goal came after Rowe controlled a cross from the left and laid off for Wellings to fire home her third league goal of the season.West Ham's deserved equaliser was a moment of class from Atkinson, her ball cutting out the entire Reading defence to allow Asseyi to score the Hammers' first league goal of the calendar year. Rowe's late curler sparked joy among the Reading players, coaching staff and fans - and it could prove to have been a crucial moment as the season draws to a close over the next three months.

It was an extraordinary end to a thrilling two-legged tie after Chelsea were awarded a penalty in the final seconds of extra time, while trailing 2-1 on aggregate.Following a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) review, referee Ivana Martincic deemed Lauren James had been fouled by Vicki Becho and Maren Mjelde stepped up under pressure to fire home the spot-kick and set up a shootout climax.Lyon's players and staff were outraged, while the home fans were on their feet as Chelsea composed themselves to deliver the success they craved and seal a last-four meeting with Barcelona.Berger sprinted to the corner flag in celebration after she pushed away Horan's sudden-death penalty and her team-mate ran across to join her.This will go down as one of the biggest victories in Chelsea's history as they join English rivals Arsenal in the semi-finals.'Drama, exhaustion, relief' - Chelsea's epic nightFootball Daily podcast: UWCL semi-finals await Hayes' ChelseaRelive Chelsea's dramatic quarter-final win over LyonMouthwatering tie delivers in LondonEight-time champions Lyon came to London trailing 1-0 after the first leg and forced extra time when Vanessa Gilles flicked a 77th-minute corner beyond Berger.Chelsea were beginning to tire as the game edged towards the extra period and Lyon took the lead through substitute Sara Dabritz when she drove a finish into the far corner after 110 minutes.But Mjelde's controversial penalty in the final seconds breathed life into Emma Hayes' side and the Norwegian then stepped up first to convert in the shootout.James, who had earned the extra-time spot-kick, was denied by Lyon goalkeeper Christiane Endler after Berger had saved Renard's effort.But Chelsea's German keeper had the final say when she dived to her right to block Horan's strike.Lyon failed to progress from just their second quarter-final in 14 appearances, while Chelsea's victory ensured two English clubs in the last four for the first time in five years.Historic victory sets up Barcelona showdownHaving come away from France with a memorable win, Chelsea were in a strong position going into the second leg, but knew they needed a gladiatorial performance.Lyon, who have dominated European football for the last decade, came with serious intention and should have scored within a matter of minutes.Delphine Cascarino forced a save from Berger, before Chelsea captain Magdalena Eriksson's poor clearance set up Signe Bruun, but the Lyon striker sliced it over the bar. The hosts eventually settled and Sam Kerr had a glorious opportunity when she was slid in one-on-one with Endler, but the goalkeeper came out on top. It felt inevitable more chances would follow and they both fell Lyon's way - Gilles then Dabritz silencing a nervy Stamford Bridge crowd.The holders, who were able to bring on star striker Ada Hegerberg at half-time, still looked vulnerable, however, and as James dribbled into the box in injury time at the end, supporters were on their feet in anticipation.Chelsea will now need to produce another giant-killing in the next round as Barcelona, who beat them in the 2021 final, await.

Frida Maanum scored one of the goals of the season when she struck the ball beautifully into the top corner after being teed up by a flick from Leah Williamson to open proceedings.Bayern were shaken by Arsenal's relentless pressing and with a record crowd for a women's European match in England in attendance, they struggled to deal with an onslaught of pressure.Stina Blackstenius capitalised to make it 2-0 when she headed in from close range and defender Lotte Wubben-Moy almost added a third but her cross clipped the crossbar.Bayern goalkeeper Maria Luisa Grohs pulled off numerous saves in an inspired performance to keep the scoreline down at half-time, and the visitors did pose a greater threat in the second half.German midfielder Lina Magull came closest when she had a shot blocked from close range before her header bounced dangerously wide off Arsenal defender Rafaelle Souza.But Arsenal had done the damage in the first half to record a memorable victory in European competition and they remain in line to win three trophies this season.'Fearless Arsenal deliver on potential in Europe'Reaction to the Women's Champions LeagueArsenal put down statement as they chase more silverwareHaving already won the League Cup this season while remaining in touching distance of the Women's Super League title, Arsenal showed at the Emirates why they are a team competing on several fronts.Jonas Eidevall's side looked up for the challenge from the first minute and were rewarded for their bravery on the ball and creativity with Maanum's stunning opener.The 21,307 in attendance - beating the previous record of 19,278 for a women's European match in England set in the 2013 final at Stamford Bridge - were treated to some of Arsenal's best football so far this season.Dealt an early blow when captain Kim Little was fouled and forced off injured, Arsenal responded with aggression as Williamson thrived in midfield, having moved from centre-back to cover Little's absence. Maanum and Blackstenius stepped up to deliver much-needed goals as Arsenal's star forwards Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema watched in the stands with anterior cruciate knee injuries.Australian forward Caitlin Foord, who Eidevall said earlier this week had been ""an important player for Arsenal"" this season, caused problems down the left, while Maanum's runs from the centre led to anxiety in Bayern's defence.Roared on by an entertained crowd, Arsenal were forced to dig deep to hold strong as Bayern pushed for a goal late on, but the hosts did not falter.They stunned holders Lyon in the group stages earlier in the competition and now have a place in the semi-finals with momentum on their side.Arsenal have already ended a four-year wait to lift a trophy this season but they look hungry for more - and this was a statement performance in London.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/65098325

Having been knocked out by Lyon in the semi-finals in 2019, Chelsea arrived in France well aware of the difficult task facing them in their pursuit of a last four spot.Lyon, who have progressed from 12 of their 13 quarter-finals, imposed their dominance early on, creating several chances for striker Eugenie Le Sommer which she could not convert. Chelsea then demonstrated their ruthlessness in front of goal as Reiten's curling shot - their first on target - nestled in the far corner, before James rattled the post shortly afterwards.The game opened up in the second half as Lyon pushed for an equaliser and Cascarino almost provided it when she struck the woodwork but Chelsea still posed a threat on the counter-attack.Emma Hayes' side have the advantage in the second leg at Stamford Bridge next Thursday but there will be concern for key England centre-back Millie Bright, who went off injured before half-time and will have a scan on Thursday morning.Moments of quality decide tight encounterLauren James has been a standout performer for Chelsea in the Women's Super League this seasonIt was only the fourth time this season the European champions had failed to find the back of the net and Chelsea will be encouraged by their solid defensive display in the second half.They limited chances and frustrated Lyon, having picked them off against the run of play in the first half to take a slender lead back to London.""It will give the team a lot of confidence. We looked nervous in the first 15 minutes. I could see a lack of movement but once we settled, we grew into the game and got more confidence,"" said Hayes. ""The result and keeping a clean sheet will give the team [confidence]. We have massive respect for Lyon. To win 1-0, I'm satisfied, but we know it's only half-time so there's things to improve on.""England international James showed her quality when she powerfully struck the post and set up Sam Kerr for a glorious chance later on - the Australian was flagged offside when she fired over the bar but replays showed she was onside.However, it was Cuthbert's endeavour to win the ball back which led to Chelsea's crucial winner and she nutmegged Damaris Egurrola before laying it off perfectly for Reiten.The game was decided by a few moments of quality, which Lyon often produce in their favour, and Chelsea still have a job on their hands to progress - but this is a huge result in their European history.""I don't want to underestimate how hard it is to come here in a quarter-final. It's intimidating and I think we managed that really well,"" added Hayes.""Pressure situations are moments that reveal your character, your wisdom, knowledge and experience. I felt the team delivered those characteristics under pressure. ""If you build consistency in your habits then every day is a Champions League day. We have become accustomed to the competition and we played with a wise head tonight.""Lyon, who suffered a shocking 5-1 defeat against Arsenal in October, could be boosted by the return of star striker Ada Hegerberg for the second leg as she was an unused substitute in France following her return from a lengthy injury.Meanwhile Lyon defender Ellie Carpenter, who only returned to action last month following a cruciate ligament injury suffered in last year's Champions League final, is set to face England and Scotland in April after being recalled to the Australia squad.

Lea Schuller's powerful 39th-minute header gave Bayern the advantage on a frustrating evening for the Gunners.Jonas Eidevall's side, chasing a first semi-final spot in a decade, came close to an equaliser on several occasions.Schuller was a standout performer, also chipping just wide in the first half. Bayern's top scorer beat Laura Wienroither at the back post and thumped her header past Arsenal goalkeeper Manuela Zinsberger as the hosts took advantage of their growing pressure in the first half. Further opportunities fell to England international Georgia Stanway, who struck wide from long range for Bayern, while Arsenal's best chance came when Caitlin Foord curled an effort onto the post just after half-time.Australian Foord was Arsenal's biggest threat on the night, testing goalkeeper Maria Luisa Grohs twice later in the second half before Stina Blackstenius' looping header and Leah Williamson's strike were both desperately cleared off the goalline by Bayern.Arsenal had several appeals for a penalty waved away as Foord's shot in the first half might have hit a hand, Rafaelle Souza's shirt might have been pulled back during Blackstenius' chance and there appeared to be a deliberate pass back to the goalkeeper after Williamson's shot was cleared. The Gunners have fallen at the quarter-final stage in their past three European campaigns but will hope to avoid the same outcome in the second leg at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday, 29 March (kick-off 20:00 BST).Bayern last reached the semi-finals in 2020-21 before losing 5-3 to Chelsea.""From a performance perspective, the players were brilliant, brave and good on the ball,"" said Arsenal boss Eidevall.

A 5-1 win over eight-time winners Lyon was the highlight for Eidevall's side, who topped Group C with four victories, while Bayern finished behind Barcelona on goal difference, having won all but one of their matches.The Gunners started on the front foot but were sloppy as Blackstenius and Frida Maanum squandered chances.Bayern began to put pressure on Arsenal's defence with Schuller's movement causing problems and she should have made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time when she chipped a shot inches wide.But Arsenal were comfortably the better side in the second half as they chased an equaliser - Bayern only coming close again in the final minutes when goalkeeper Zinsberger pulled off an impressive double save to deny Maximiliane Rall.With a potential league decider against rivals Wolfsburg to come at the weekend, Bayern brought off key players Stanway, captain Lina Magull and goalscorer Schuller before full-time - the latter having picked up a knock - but were able to hold on impressively against a determined Arsenal late on. Arsenal will take encouragement from the number of chances they created in the second half but on too many occasions already this season their lack of ruthlessness in front of goal has proven costly and they will need to avoid the same at Emirates Stadium next week.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/64959148

But last year's finalists were given a scare at Stadio Olimpico. Several missed chances by Barcelona almost proved costly as Roma threatened heavily late on. Barcelona's Asisat Oshoala, Aitana Bonmati and Caroline Graham Hansen were all denied, while further chances were spurned by the 2021 champions, particularly after the break. The Spanish giants, who have reached three finals in the past four years, were frustrated by Roma goalkeeper Camelia Ceasar's inspired display.Ceasar made several crucial saves to block Oshoala in the second half, having kept out Graham Hansen and Bonmati before the break, and Oshoala's header was also cleared off the line by defender Elena Linari. Roma, who were given a standing ovation by home fans at half-time for their efforts, had a flurry of chances in the second half and grew into the game. Valentina Giacinti's shot was deflected inches over the bar by Maria Leon before the Italians showed a glimpse of their threat on the counter-attack when Emilie Haavi later forced a smart save from Barcelona's Sandra Panos.Andressa Alves struck wide and Manuela Giugliano had a powerful effort tipped over the bar with less than 10 minutes remaining, before Giacinti almost equalised in the final minute from a smart free-kick routine.
